Sir Roderick I. Murchison,\\nColonel P. Yorke and Dr. Shaw, a deputation from that distinguished\\nbody, with their usual zeal for discovery and readiness to encourage\\nthe discoverer, honoured me by warmly supporting, in a personal\\ninterview with the then Chairman of the then Court of Directors to the\\nthen Honourable East India Company, my application for three years\\'\\nleave of absence on special duty from India to Maskat. But they were\\nunable to prevail upon the said Chairman, the late Sir James Hogg,\\nwho,[FN#1] remembering the fatalities which of late years have befallen\\nsundry soldier-travellers in the East, refused his sanction, alleging\\nas a reason[FN#1]\\n</p><p>[p.2]that the contemplated journey was of too dangerous a nature. In\\ncompensation, however, for the disappointment, I was allowed the\\nadditional furlough of a year, in order to pursue my Arabic studies in\\nlands where the language is best learned.\\n</p><p>What remained for me but to prove, by trial, that what might be\\nperilous to other travellers was safe to me? The \"experimentum crucis\"\\nwas a visit to Al-Hijaz, at once the most difficult and the most\\ndangerous point by which a European can enter Arabia. I had intended,\\nhad the period of leave originally applied for been granted, to land at\\nMaskat-a favourable starting-place-and there to apply myself, slowly\\nand surely, to the task of spanning the deserts. But now I was to\\nhurry, in the midst of summer, after a four years\\' sojourn in Europe,\\nduring which many things Oriental had faded away from my memory,\\nand-after passing through the ordeal of Egypt, a country where the\\npolice is curious as in Rome or Milan-to begin with the Moslem\\'s Holy\\nLand, the jealously guarded and exclusive Harim. However, being\\nliberally supplied with the means of travel by the Royal Geographical\\nSociety; thoroughly tired of \"progress\" and of \"civilisation;\" curious\\nto see with my eyes what others are content to \"hear with ears,\"\\nnamely, Moslem inner life in a really Mohammedan country; and longing,\\nif truth be told, to set foot on that mysterious spot which no vacation\\ntourist has yet described, measured, sketched and photographed, I\\nresolved to resume my old character of a Persian wanderer,[FN#2] a\\n\"Darwaysh,\" and to make the attempt.\\n</p><p>[p.3]The principal object with which I started was this: to cross the\\nunknown Arabian Peninsula, in a direct line from either Al-Madinah to\\nMaskat, or diagonally from Meccah to Makallah on the Indian Ocean. By\\nwhat \"Circumstance, the miscreator\" my plans were defeated, the reader\\nwill discover in the course of these volumes. The secondary objects\\nwere numerous. I was desirous to find out if any market for horses\\ncould be opened between Central Arabia and India, where the studs were\\nbeginning to excite general dissatisfaction; to obtain information\\nconcerning the Great Eastern wilderness, the vast expanse marked Rub\\'a\\nal-Khai (the \"Empty Abode\") in our maps; to inquire into the\\nhydrography of the Hijaz, its water-shed, the disputed slope of the\\ncountry, and the existence or non-existence of perennial streams; and\\nfinally, to try, by actual observation, the truth of a theory proposed\\nby Colonel W. Sykes, namely, that if tradition be true, in the\\npopulation of the vast Peninsula there must exist certain physiological\\ndifferences sufficient to warrant our questioning the common origin of\\nthe Arab family. As regards horses, I am satisfied that from the\\nEastern coast something might be done-nothing on the Western, where the\\nanimals, though thorough-bred, are mere \"weeds,\" of a foolish price and\\nprocurable only by chance. Of the Rub\\'a al-Khali I have heard enough,\\nfrom credible relators, to conclude that its horrid depths swarm with a\\nlarge and half-starving population; that it abounds in Wadys, valleys,\\ngullies and ravines, partially fertilised by intermittent torrents;\\nand, therefore, that the land is open to the adventurous traveller.\\nMoreover, I am satisfied, that in spite of all geographers, from\\nPtolemy to Jomard, Arabia, which abounds in fiumaras,[FN#3] possesses\\nnot\\n</p><p>[p.4]a single perennial stream worthy the name of river;[FN#4] and the\\ntestimony of the natives induces me to think, with Wallin, contrary to\\nRitter and others, that the Peninsula falls instead of rising towards\\nthe south. Finally, I have found proof, to be produced in a future part\\nof this publication, for believing in three distinct races. 1. The\\naborigines of the country, driven like the Bhils and other autochthonic\\nIndians, into the eastern and south-eastern wilds bordering upon the\\nocean. 2. A Syrian or Mesopotamian stock, typified by Shem and Joktan,\\nthat drove the Indigenae from the choicest tracts of country; these\\ninvaders still enjoy their conquests, representing the great Arabian\\npeople. And 3. An impure Syro-Egyptian clan-we personify it by Ishmael,\\nby his son Nabajoth, and by Edom, (Esau, the son of Isaac)-that\\npopulated and still populates the Sinaitic Peninsula. And in most\\nplaces, even in the heart of Meccah, I met with debris of heathenry,\\nproscribed by Mohammed, yet still popular, while the ignorant observers\\nof the old customs assign to them a modern and a rationalistic origin.\\n</p><p>I have entitled this account of my summer\\'s tour through Al-Hijaz, a\\nPersonal Narrative, and I have laboured to make its nature correspond\\nwith its name, simply because \"it is the personal that interests\\nmankind.\" Many may not follow my example;[FN#5] but some\\n</p><p>[p.5]perchance will be curious to see what measures I adopted, in order\\nto appear suddenly as an Eastern upon the stage of Oriental life; and\\nas the recital may be found useful by future adventurers, I make no\\napology for the egotistical semblance of the narrative. Those who have\\nfelt the want of some \"silent friend\" to aid them with advice, when it\\nmust not be asked, will appreciate what may appear to the uninterested\\ncritic mere outpourings of a mind full of self.[FN#6]\\n</p><p>On the evening of April 3, 1853, I left London for Southampton. By the\\nadvice of a brother officer, Captain (now Colonel) Henry Grindlay, of\\nthe Bengal Cavalry,-little thought at that time the adviser or the\\nadvised how valuable was the suggestion!-my Eastern dress was called\\ninto requisition before leaving town, and all my \"impedimenta\" were\\ntaught to look exceedingly Oriental. Early the next day a \"Persian\\nPrince,\" accompanied by Captain Grindlay, embarked on board the\\nPeninsular and Oriental Company\\'s magnificent screw steamer \"Bengal.\"\\n</p><p>[p.6]A fortnight was profitably spent in getting into the train of\\nOriental manners. For what polite Chesterfield says of the difference\\nbetween a gentleman and his reverse-namely, that both perform the same\\noffices of life, but each in a several and widely different way-is\\nnotably as applicable to the manners of the Eastern as of the Western\\nman. Look, for instance, at that Indian Moslem drinking a glass of\\nwater. With us the operation is simple enough, but his performance\\nincludes no fewer than five novelties. In the first place he clutches\\nhis tumbler as though it were the throat of a foe; secondly, he\\nejaculates, \"In the name of Allah the Compassionate, the Merciful!\"\\nbefore wetting his lips; thirdly, he imbibes the contents, swallowing\\nthem, not sipping them as he ought to do, and ending with a satisfied\\ngrunt; fourthly, before setting down the cup, he sighs forth, \"Praise\\nbe to Allah\"-of which you will understand the full meaning in the\\nDesert; and, fifthly, he replies, \"May Allah make it pleasant to thee!\"\\nin answer to his friend\\'s polite \"Pleasurably and health!\" Also he is\\ncareful to avoid the irreligious action of drinking the pure element in\\na standing position, mindful, however, of the three recognised\\nexceptions, the fluid of the Holy Well Zemzem, water distributed in\\ncharity, and that which remains after Wuzu, the lesser ablution.\\nMoreover, in Europe, where both extremities are used indiscriminately,\\none forgets the exclusive use of the right hand, the manipulation of\\nthe rosary, the abuse of the chair,-your genuine Oriental gathers up\\nhis legs, looking almost as comfortable in it as a sailor upon the back\\nof a high-trotting -the rolling gait with the toes straight to the\\nfront, the grave look and the habit of pious ejaculations.\\n</p><p>Our voyage over the \"summer sea\" was eventless. In a steamer of two or\\nthree thousand tons you discover\\n</p><p>[p.7]the once dreaded, now contemptible, \"stormy waters\" only by the\\nband-a standing nuisance be it remarked-performing\\n</p><p>\"There we lay\\nAll the day,\\nIn the Bay of Biscay, O!\"\\n</p><p>The sight of glorious Trafalgar[FN#7]| excites none of the sentiments\\nwith which a tedious sail used to invest it. \"Gib\" is, probably, better\\nknown to you, by Theophile Gautier and Eliot Warburton, than the\\nregions about Cornhill; besides which, you anchor under the Rock\\nexactly long enough to land and to breakfast. Malta, too, wears an old\\nfamiliar face, which bids you order a dinner and superintend the iceing\\nof claret (beginning of Oriental barbarism), instead of galloping about\\non donkey-back through fiery air in memory of St. Paul and White-Cross\\nKnights. But though our journey might be called monotonous, there was\\nnothing to complain of. The ship was in every way comfortable; the\\ncook, strange to say, was good, and the voyage lasted long enough, and\\nnot too long. On the evening of the thirteenth day after our start, the\\nbig-trowsered pilot, so lovely in his deformities to western eyes, made\\nhis appearance, and the good screw \"Bengal\" found herself at anchor off\\nthe Headland of Clay.[FN#8]\\n</p><p>Having been invited to start from the house of a kind friend, John W.\\nLarking, I disembarked with him, and\\n</p><p>[p.8]rejoiced to see that by dint of a beard and a shaven head I had\\nsucceeded, like the Lord of Geesh, in \"misleading the inquisitive\\nspirit of the populace.\" The mingled herd of spectators before whom we\\npassed in review on the landing-place, hearing an audible\\n\"Alhamdolillah\"[FN#9] whispered \"Muslim!\" The infant population spared\\nme the compliments usually addressed to hatted heads; and when a little\\nboy, presuming that the occasion might possibly open the hand of\\ngenerosity, looked in my face and exclaimed \"Bakhshish,\"[FN#10] he\\nobtained in reply a \"Mafish;\"[FN#11] which convinced the bystanders\\nthat the sheep-skin covered a real sheep. We then mounted a carriage,\\nfought our way through the donkeys, and in half an hour found\\nourselves, chibuk in mouth and coffee-cup in hand, seated on the diwan\\nof my friend Larking\\'s hospitable home.\\n</p><p>Wonderful was the contrast between the steamer and that villa on the\\nMahmudiyah canal! Startling the sudden change from presto to adagio\\nlife! In thirteen days we had passed from the clammy grey fog, that\\natmosphere\\n</p><p>[p.9]of industry which kept us at anchor off the Isle of Wight, through\\nthe loveliest air of the Inland Sea, whose sparkling blue and purple\\nhaze spread charms even on N. Africa\\'s beldame features, and now we are\\nsitting silent and still, listening to the monotonous melody of the\\nEast-the soft night-breeze wandering through starlit skies and tufted\\ntrees, with a voice of melancholy meaning.\\n</p><p>And this is the Arab\\'s Kayf. The savouring of animal existence; the\\npassive enjoyment of mere sense; the pleasant languor, the dreamy\\ntranquillity, the airy castle-building, which in Asia stand in lieu of\\nthe vigorous, intensive, passionate life of Europe. It is the result of\\na lively, impressible, excitable nature, and exquisite sensibility of\\nnerve; it argues a facility for voluptuousness unknown to northern\\nregions, where happiness is placed in the exertion of mental and\\nphysical powers; where Ernst ist das Leben; where niggard earth\\ncommands ceaseless sweat of face, and damp chill air demands perpetual\\nexcitement, exercise, or change, or adventure, or dissipation, for want\\nof something better. In the East, man wants but rest and shade: upon\\nthe banks of a bubbling stream, or under the cool shelter of a perfumed\\ntree, he is perfectly happy, smoking a pipe, or sipping a cup of\\ncoffee, or drinking a glass of sherbet, but above all things deranging\\nbody and mind as little as possible; the trouble of conversations, the\\ndispleasures of memory, and the vanity of thought being the most\\nunpleasant interruptions to his Kayf. No wonder that \"Kayf\" is a word\\nuntranslatable in our mother-tongue![FN#12]\\n</p><p>\"Laudabunt alii claram Rhodon aut Mytelenen.\"\\n</p><p>Let others describe the once famous Capital of\\n</p><p>[p.10]Egypt, this City of Misnomers, whose dry docks are ever wet, and\\nwhose marble fountain is eternally dry, whose \"Cleopatra\\'s\\nNeedle\"[FN13] is neither a needle nor Cleopatra\\'s; whose \"Pompey\\'s\\nPillar\" never had any earthly connection with Pompey; and whose\\nCleopatra\\'s Baths are, according to veracious travellers, no baths at\\nall. Yet it is a wonderful place, this \"Libyan suburb\" of our day, this\\noutpost of civilisation planted upon the skirts of barbarism, this\\nOsiris seated side by side with Typhon, his great old enemy. Still may\\nbe said of it, \"it ever beareth something new[FN#14];\" and Alexandria,\\na threadbare subject in Bruce\\'s time, is even yet, from its perpetual\\nchanges, a fit field for modern description.[FN#15]\\n</p><p>[p.11]The better to blind the inquisitive eyes of servants and\\nvisitors, my friend, Larking, lodged me in an out-house, where I could\\nrevel in the utmost freedom of life and manners. And although some\\nArmenian Dragoman, a restless spy like all his race, occasionally\\nremarked voila un Persan diablement degage, none, except those who were\\nentrusted with the secret, had any idea of the part I was playing. The\\ndomestics, devout Moslems, pronounced me an \\'Ajami,[FN#16] a kind of\\nMohammedan, not a good one like themselves, but, still better than\\nnothing. I lost no time in securing the assistance of a Shaykh,[FN#17]\\nand plunged once more into the intricacies of the Faith; revived my\\nrecollections of religious ablutions, read the Koran, and again became\\nan adept in the art of prostration. My leisure hours were employed in\\nvisiting the baths and coffee-houses, in attending the bazars, and in\\nshopping,-an operation which hereabouts consists of sitting upon a\\nchapman\\'s counter, smoking, sipping coffee, and telling your beads the\\nwhile, to show that you are not of the slaves for whom time is made; in\\nfact, in pitting your patience against that of your adversary, the\\nvendor. I found time for a short excursion to a country village on the\\nbanks of the canal; nor was an opportunity of seeing \"Al-nahl,\" the\\n\"Bee-dance;\" neglected, for it would be some months before my eyes\\nmight dwell on such a pleasant spectacle again.\\n\"Delicias videam, Nile jocose, tuas!\"\\n</p><p>Careful of graver matters, I attended the mosque, and visited the\\nvenerable localities in which modern Alexandria abounds. Pilgrimaging\\nMoslems are here\\n</p><p>[p.12]shown the tomb of Al-nabi Daniyal (Daniel the Prophet),\\ndiscovered upon a spot where the late Sultan Mahmud dreamed that he saw\\nan ancient man at prayer.[FN#18] Sikandar al-Rumi, the Moslem Alexander\\nthe Great, of course left his bones in the place bearing his name, or,\\nas he ought to have done so, bones have been found for him. Alexandria\\nalso boasts of two celebrated Walis-holy men. One is Mohammed\\nal-Busiri, the author of a poem called Al-Burdah, universally read by\\nthe world of Islam, and locally recited at funerals and on other solemn\\noccasions. The other is Abu Abbas al-Andalusi, a sage and saint of the\\nfirst water, at whose tomb prayer is never breathed in vain.\\n</p><p>It is not to be supposed that the people of Alexandria could look upon\\nmy phials and pill-boxes without a yearning for their contents. An\\nIndian doctor, too, was a novelty to them; Franks they despised,-but a\\nman who had come so far from East and West! Then there was something\\ninfinitely seducing in the character of a magician, doctor, and fakir,\\neach admirable of itself, thus combined to make \"great medicine.\" Men,\\nwomen, and children besieged my door, by which means I could see the\\npeople face to face, and especially the fair sex, of which Europeans,\\ngenerally speaking, know only the worst specimens. Even respectable\\nnatives, after witnessing a performance of \"Mandal\" and the Magic\\nmirror[FN#19], opined that the stranger was a holy man, gifted\\n</p><p>[p.13]with supernatural powers, and knowing everything. One old person\\nsent to offer me his daughter in marriage; he said nothing about\\ndowry,-but I thought proper to decline the honour. And a middle-aged\\nlady proffered me the sum of one hundred piastres, nearly one pound\\nsterling, if I would stay at Alexandria, and superintend the\\nrestoration of her blind left eye.\\n</p><p>But the reader must not be led to suppose that I acted \"Carabin\" or\\n\"Sangrado\" without any knowledge of my trade. From youth I have always\\nbeen a dabbler in medical and mystical study. Moreover, the practice of\\nphysic is comparatively easy amongst dwellers in warm latitudes,\\nuncivilised peoples, where there is not that complication of maladies\\nwhich troubles more polished nations. And further, what simplifies\\nextremely the treatment of the sick in these parts is the undoubted\\nperiodicity of disease, reducing almost all to one type-ague.[FN#20]\\nMany of the complaints of tropical climates, as medical men well know,\\ndisplay palpably intermittent symptoms little known to colder\\ncountries; and speaking from individual experience, I may safely assert\\nthat in all cases of suffering, from a wound to ophthalmia, this\\nphenomenon has forced itself upon my notice. So much by way of excuse.\\nI therefore considered myself as well qualified for the work as if I\\nhad taken out a buono per l\\'estero diploma at Padua, and not more\\nlikely to do active harm than most of the regularly graduated young\\nsurgeons who start to \"finish\" themselves upon the frame of the British\\nsoldier.\\n</p><p>After a month\\'s hard work at Alexandria, I prepared to assume the\\ncharacter of a wandering Darwaysh; after\\n</p><p>[p.14]reforming my title from \"Mirza\"[FN#21] to \"Shaykh\"\\nAbdullah.[FN#22] A reverend man, whose name I do not care to quote,\\nsome time ago initiated me into his order, the Kadiriyah, under the\\nhigh-sounding name of Bismillah-Shah:[FN#23] and, after a due period of\\nprobation, he graciously elevated me to the proud position of a\\nMurshid,[FN#24] or Master in the mystic craft. I was therefore\\nsufficiently well acquainted with the tenets and practices of these\\nOriental Freemasons. No character in the Moslem world is so proper for\\ndisguise as that of the Darwaysh. It is assumed by all ranks, ages, and\\ncreeds; by the nobleman who has been disgraced at court, and by the\\npeasant who is too idle to till the ground; by Dives, who is weary of\\nlife, and by Lazarus, who begs his bread from door to door. Further,\\nthe Darwaysh is allowed to ignore ceremony and politeness, as one who\\nceases to appear upon the stage of life; he may pray or not, marry or\\nremain single as he pleases, be respectable in cloth of frieze as in\\ncloth of gold, and no one asks him-the chartered vagabond-\\n</p><p>[p.15]Why he comes here? or Wherefore he goes there? He may wend his\\nway on foot alone, or ride his Arab mare followed by a dozen servants;\\nhe is equally feared without weapons, as swaggering through the streets\\narmed to the teeth. The more haughty and offensive he is to the people,\\nthe more they respect him; a decided advantage to the traveller of\\ncholeric temperament. In the hour of imminent danger, he has only to\\nbecome a maniac, and he is safe; a madman in the East, like a notably\\neccentric character in the West, is allowed to say or do whatever the\\nspirit directs. Add to this character a little knowledge of medicine, a\\n\"moderate skill in magic, and a reputation for caring for nothing but\\nstudy and books,\" together with capital sufficient to save you from the\\nchance of starving, and you appear in the East to peculiar advantage.\\nThe only danger of the \"Mystic Path\"[FN#25] is, that the Darwaysh\\'s\\nragged coat not unfrequently covers the cut-throat, and, if seized in\\nthe society of such a \"brother,\" you may reluctantly become his\\ncompanion, under the stick or on the stake. For be it known, Darwayshes\\nare of two orders, the Sharai, or those who conform to religion, and\\nthe Bi-Sharai, or Luti, whose practices are hinted at by their own\\ntradition that \"he we daurna name\" once joined them for a week, but at\\nthe end of that time left them in dismay, and returned to whence he\\ncame.\\n</p><p>[FN#1] \"Remembering . . . . reason,\" afterwards altered by the author\\nto \"much disliking, if fact must be told, my impolitic habit of telling\\npolitical truths, (in 1851 I had submitted to the Court of Directors\\ncertain remarks upon the subject of Anglo-Indian misrule: I need hardly\\nsay that the publication was refused with many threats), and not\\nunwilling to mortify my supporter (his colleague, Colonel W. Sykes),\\nrefused his sanction, alleging as a no-reason,\" et seq.\\n[FN#2] The vagrant, the merchant, and the philosopher, amongst\\nOrientals, are frequently united in the same person.\\n[FN#3] In a communication made to the Royal Geographical Society, and\\npublished in the 24th vol. of the Journal, I have given my reasons for\\nnaturalising this word. It will be used in the following pages to\\nexpress a \"hill water-course, which rolls a torrent after rain, and is\\neither partially or wholly dry during the droughts.\" It is, in fact,\\nthe Indian \"Nullah, or Nala.\"\\n[FN#4] \"In provinciis Arabum, ait Ibn Haukal, nullus dignoscitur\\nfluvius, aut mare quod navigia ferat.\" This truth has been disputed,\\nbut now it is generally acknowledged.\\n[FN#5] A French traveller, the Viscount Escayrac de Lanture, was living\\nat Cairo as a native of the East, and preparing for a pilgrimage when I\\nwas similarly engaged. Unfortunately he went to Damascus, where some\\ndisturbance compelled him to resume his nationality. The only European\\nI have met with who visited Meccah without apostatising, is M.\\nBertolucci, Swedish Consul at Cairo. This gentleman persuaded the\\nBadawin camel men who were accompanying him to Taif to introduce him in\\ndisguise: he na\\xef\\xbf\\xbdvely owns that his terror of discovery prevented his\\nmaking any observations. Dr. George A. Wallin, of Finland, performed\\nthe Hajj in 1845; but his \"somewhat perilous position, and the filthy\\ncompany of Persians,\" were effectual obstacles to his taking notes.\\n[FN#6] No one felt the want of this \"silent friend,\" more than myself;\\nfor though Eastern Arabia would not have been strange to me, the\\nWestern regions were a terra incognita. Through Dr. Norton Shaw,\\nSecretary to the Royal Geographical Society, I addressed a paper full\\nof questions to Dr. Wallin, professor of Arabic at the University of\\nHelsingfors. But that adventurous traveller and industrious Orienta1ist\\nwas then, as we afterwards heard with sorrow, no more; so the queries\\nremained unanswered. In these pages I have been careful to solve all\\nthe little financial and domestic difficulties, so perplexing to the\\n\"freshman,\" whom circumstances compel to conceal his freshness from the\\nprying eyes of friends.\\n[FN#7] \"Then came Trafalgar: would that Nelson had known the meaning of\\nthat name! it would have fixed a smile upon his dying lips!\" so says\\nthe Rider through the Nubian Desert, giving us in a foot note the\\ncurious information that \"Trafalgar\" is an Arabic word, which means the\\n\"Cape of Laurels.\" Trafalgar is nothing but a corruption of Tarf\\nal-Gharb-the side or skirt of the West; it being the most occidental\\npoint then reached by Arab conquest.\\n[FN#8] In Arabic \"Ras al-Tin,\" the promontory upon which immortal\\nPharos once stood. It is so called from the argile there found and\\nwhich supported an old pottery.\\n[FN#9] \"Praise be to Allah, Lord of the (three) worlds!\" a pious\\nejaculation, which leaves the lips of the True Believer on all\\noccasions of concluding actions.\\n[FN#10] \"Bakhshish,\" says a modern writer, \"is a fee or present which\\nthe Arabs (he here means the Egyptians, who got the word from the\\nPersians through the Turks,) claim on all occasions for services you\\nrender them, as well as for services they have rendered you. A doctor\\nvisits a patient gratis-the patient or his servant will ask for a\\nbakhshish (largesse); you employ, pay, clothe, and feed a child-the\\nfather will demand his bakhshish; you may save the life of an Arab, at\\nthe risk of your own, and he will certainly claim a bakhshish. This\\nbakhshish, in fact, is a sort of alms or tribute, which the poor Arab\\nbelieves himself entitled to claim from every respectable-looking\\nperson.\"\\n[FN#11] Mafish, \"there is none,\" equivalent to, \"I have left my purse\\nat home.\" Nothing takes the Oriental mind so much as a retort\\nalliterative or jingling. An officer in the Bombay army (Colonel\\nHamerton) once saved himself from assault and battery by informing a\\nfurious band of natives, that under British rule \"harakat na hui,\\nbarakat hui,\" \"blessing hath there been to you; bane there hath been\\nnone.\"\\n[FN#12] In a coarser sense \"kayf\" is app1ied to all manner of\\nintoxication. Sonnini is not wrong when he says, \"the Arabs give the\\nname of Kayf to the voluptuous relaxation, the delicious stupor,\\nproduced by the smoking of hemp.\"\\n[FN#13] Cleopatra\\'s Needle is called by the native Ciceroni \"Masallat\\nFiraun,\" Pharaoh\\'s packing needle. What Solomon, and the Jinnis and\\nSikandar zu\\'l karnain (Alexander of Macedon), are to other Moslem\\nlands, such is Pharaoh to Egypt, the \"Caesar aut Diabolus\" of the Nile.\\nThe ichneumon becomes \"Pharaoh\\'s cat,\"-even the French were bitten and\\nnamed it, le rat de Pharaon; the prickly pear, \"Pharaoh\\'s fig;\" the\\nguinea-worm, \"Pharaoh\\'s worm;\" certain unapproachable sulphur springs,\\n\"Pharaoh\\'s bath;\" a mausoleum at Petra, \"Pharaoh\\'s palace;\" the mongrel\\nrace now inhabiting the valley of the Nile is contemptuously named by\\nTurks and Arabs \"Jins Firaun,\" or \"Pharaoh\\'s Breed;\" and a foul kind of\\nvulture (vultur percnopterus, ak baba of the Turks, and ukab of Sind),\\n\"Pharaoh\\'s hen.\" This abhorrence of Pharaoh is, however, confined to\\nthe vulgar and the religious. The philosophers and mystics of Al-Islam,\\nin their admiration of his impious daring, make him equal, and even\\nsuperior, to Moses. Sahil, a celebrated Sufi, declares that the secret\\nof the soul (i.e., its emanation) was first revealed when Pharaoh\\ndeclared himself a god. And Al-Ghazali sees in such temerity nothing\\nbut the most noble aspiration to the divine, innate in the human,\\nspirit. (Dabistan, vol. iii.)\\n[FN#14] [Greek text] \"Quid novi fert Africa?\" said the Romans. \"In the\\nsame season Fayoles, tetrarch of Numidia, sent from the land of Africa\\nto Grangousier, the most hideously great mare that was ever seen; for\\nyou know well enough how it is said, that \\xef\\xbf\\xbdAfrica always is productive\\nof some new thing.\\'\"\\n[FN#15] Alexandria, moreover, is an interesting place to Moslems, on\\naccount of the prophecy that it will succeed to the honours of Meccah,\\nwhen the holy city falls into the hands of the infidel. In its turn\\nAlexandria will be followed by Kairawan (in the Regency of Tunis); and\\n</p><p>this by Rashid or Rosetta, which last shall endure to the end of time.\\n[FN#16] A Persian as opposed to an Arab.\\n[FN#17] A priest, elder, chieftain, language-master, private-tutor,\\n&amp;c., &amp;c.\\n[FN#18] The Persians place the Prophet\\'s tomb at Susan or Sus,\\ndescribed by Ibn Haukal (p. 76). The readers of Ibn Batutah may think\\nit strange that the learned and pious traveller in his account of\\nAlexandria (chap. 2.) makes no allusion to the present holy deceased\\nthat distinguish the city. All the saints are now clear forgotten. For\\nit is the fate of saints, like distinguished sinners, to die twice.\\n[FN#19] The Mandal is that form of Oriental divination which owes its\\npresent celebrity in Europe to Mr. Lane. Both it and the magic mirror\\nare hackneyed subjects, but I have been tempted to a few words\\nconcerning them in another part of these volumes. Meanwhile I request\\nthe reader not to set me down as a mere charlatan; medicine in the East\\nis so essentially united with superstitious practices, that he who\\nwould pass for an expert practitioner, must necessarily represent\\nhimself an \"adept.\"\\n[FN#20] Hence the origin, I believe, of the Chronothermal System, a\\ndiscovery which physic owes to my old friend, the late Dr. Samuel\\nDickson.\\n[FN#21] The Persian \"Mister.\" In future chapters the reader will see\\nthe uncomfortable consequences of my having appeared in Egypt as a\\nPersian. Although I found out the mistake, and worked hard to correct\\nit, the bad name stuck to me; bazar reports fly quicker and hit harder\\nthan newspaper paragraphs.\\n[FN#22] Arab Christians sometimes take the name of \"Abdullah,\" servant\\nof Allah-\"which,\" as a modern traveller observes, \"all sects and\\nreligions might be equally proud to adopt.\" The Moslem Prophet said,\\n\"the names most approved of God are Abdullah, Abd-al-rahman (Slave of\\nthe Compassionate), and such like.\"\\n[FN#23] \"King in-the-name-of-Allah,\" a kind of Oriental\\n\"Praise-God-Barebones.\" When a man appears as a Fakir or Darwaysh, he\\ncasts off, in process of regeneration, together with other worldly\\nsloughs, his laical name for some brilliant coat of nomenclature rich\\nin religious promise.\\n[FN#24] A Murshid is one allowed to admit Murids or apprentices into\\nthe order.

For a while he smokes the \"pipe of permanence\"[FN#1] with an\\ninfinite zest; he delights in various siestas during the day, relishing\\nwithal deep sleep during the dark hours; he enjoys dining at a fixed\\ndinner hour, and he wonders at the demoralisation of the mind which\\ncannot find means of excitement in chit-chat or small talk, in a novel\\nor a newspaper. But soon the passive fit has passed away; again a\\nparoxysm of ennui coming on by slow degrees, Viator loses appetite, he\\nwalks about his room all night, he yawns at conversations, and a book\\nacts upon him as a narcotic. The man wants to wander, and he must do\\nso, or he shall die.\\n</p><p>After about a month most pleasantly spent at Alexandria, I perceived\\nthe approach of the enemy, and as nothing hampered my incomings and\\noutgoings, I surrendered. The world was \"all before me,\" and there was\\npleasant excitement in plunging single-handed into its chilling depths.\\nMy Alexandrian Shaykh, whose heart\\n</p><p>[p.17]fell victim to a new \"jubbah,\" which I had given in exchange for\\nhis tattered za\\'abut[FN#2] offered me, in consideration of a certain\\nmonthly stipend, the affections of a brother and religious refreshment,\\nproposing to send his wife back to her papa, and to accompany me, in\\nthe capacity of private chaplain to the other side of Kaf.\\n[FN#3] I politely accepted the \"Bruderschaft,\" but many reasons induced\\nme to decline his society and services. In the first place, he spoke\\nthe detestable Egyptian jargon. Secondly, it was but prudent to lose\\nthe \"spoor\" between Alexandria and Suez. And, thirdly, my \"brother\" had\\nshifting eyes (symptoms of fickleness), close together (indices of\\ncunning); a flat-crowned head, and large ill-fitting lips; signs which\\nled me to think lightly of his honesty, firmness, and courage.\\nPhrenology and physiognomy, be it observed, disappoint you often\\namongst civilised people, the proper action of whose brain upon the\\nfeatures is impeded by the external pressure of education, accident,\\nexample, habit, and necessity. But they are tolerably safe guides when\\ngroping your way through the mind of man in his so-called natural\\nstate, a being of impulse, in that chrysalis condition of mental\\ndevelopment which is rather instinct than reason.\\n</p><p>Before my departure, however, there was much to be done.\\n</p><p>The land of the Pharaohs is becoming civilised, and unpleasantly so:\\nnothing can be more uncomfortable than its present middle state,\\nbetween barbarism and the reverse. The prohibition against carrying\\narms is rigid as in Italy; all \"violence\" is violently denounced; and\\nbeheading\\n</p><p>[p.18]being deemed cruel, the most atrocious crimes, as well as those\\nsmall political offences, which in the days of the Mamluks would have\\nled to a beyship or a bow-string, receive fourfold punishment by\\ndeportation to Fayzoghlu, the local Cayenne. If you order your peasant\\nto be flogged, his friends gather in threatening hundreds at your\\ngates; when you curse your boatman, he complains to your consul; the\\ndragomans afflict you with strange wild notions about honesty; a\\nGovernment order prevents you from using vituperative language to the\\n\"natives\" in general; and the very donkey boys are becoming cognisant\\nof the right of man to remain unbastinadoed. Still the old leaven\\nremains behind: here, as elsewhere in the \"Morning-land,\" you cannot\\nhold your own without employing the voie de fait. The passport system,\\nnow dying out of Europe, has sprung up, or rather has revived, in\\nEgypt, with peculiar vigour.[FN#4] Its good effects claim for it our\\nrespect; still we cannot but lament its inconvenience. By we, I mean\\nreal Easterns. As strangers-even those whose beards have whitened in\\nthe land-know absolutely nothing of what unfortunate natives must\\nendure, I am tempted to subjoin a short\\n</p><p>[p.19]sketch of my adventures in search of a Tazkirah, or passport, at\\nAlexandria.\\n</p><p>Through ignorance which might have cost me dear but for friend\\nLarking\\'s weight with the local authorities, I had neglected to provide\\nmyself with a passport in England, and it was not without difficulty,\\ninvolving much unclean dressing and an unlimited expenditure of broken\\nEnglish, that I obtained from H.B.M\\'s Consul at Alexandria a\\ncertificate, declaring me to be an Indo-British subject named Abdullah,\\nby profession a doctor, aged thirty, and not distinguished-at least so\\nthe frequent blanks seemed to denote-by any remarkable conformation of\\neyes, nose, or cheek. For this I disbursed a dollar. And here let me\\nrecord the indignation with which I did it. That mighty Britain-the\\nmistress of the seas-the ruler of one-sixth of mankind-should charge\\nfive shillings to pay for the shadow of her protecting wing! That I\\ncannot speak my modernised \"civis sum Romanus\" without putting my hand\\ninto my pocket, in order that these officers of the Great Queen may not\\ntake too ruinously from a revenue of seventy millions! O the meanness\\nof our magnificence! the littleness of our greatness!\\n</p><p>My new passport would not carry me without the Zabit or Police\\nMagistrate\\'s counter-signature, said H.B.M.\\'s Consul. Next day I went\\nto the Zabit, who referred me to the Muhafiz (Governor) of Alexandria,\\nat whose gate I had the honour of squatting at least three hours, till\\na more compassionate clerk vouchsafed the information that the proper\\nplace to apply to was the Diwan Kharijiyah (the Foreign Office). Thus a\\nsecond day was utterly lost. On the morning of the third I started, as\\ndirected, for the Palace, which crowns the Headland of Clay. It is a\\nhuge and couthless shell of building in parallelogrammic form,\\ncontaining all kinds of public offices in glorious confusion, looking\\nwith their glaring\\n</p><p>[p.20]white-washed faces upon a central court, where a few leafless\\nwind-wrung trees seem struggling for the breath of life in an eternal\\natmosphere of clay-dust and sun-blaze.[FN#5]\\n</p><p>The first person I addressed was a Kawwas[FN#6] or police officer, who,\\ncoiled comfortably up in a bit of shade fitting his person like a robe,\\nwas in full enjoyment of the Asiatic \"Kayf.\" Having presented the\\nconsular certificate and briefly stated the nature of my business, I\\nventured to inquire what was the right course to pursue for a visa.\\n</p><p>They have little respect for Darwayshes, it appears, at Alexandria.\\n</p><p>M\\'adri-\"Don\\'t know,\" growled the man of authority, without moving any\\nthing but the quantity of tongue absolutely necessary for articulation.\\n</p><p>Now there are three ways of treating Asiatic officials,-by bribe, by\\nbullying, or by bothering them with a dogged perseverance into\\nattending to you and your concerns.

Ruh! \"Be\\noff,\" was what I obtained for all reply. But this time the questioned\\nwent so far as to open his eyes. Still I stood twirling the paper in my\\nhands, and looking very humble and very persevering, till a loud Ruh ya\\nKalb! \"Go, O dog!\" converted into a responsive curse the little speech\\nI was preparing about\\n</p><p>[p.21]the brotherhood of Al-Islam and the mutual duties obligatory on\\ntrue believers.

British flesh and blood could never have stood that.\\n</p><p>After which satisfactory scene,-for satisfactory it was in one sense,\\nproving the complete fitness of the Darwaysh\\'s costume,-I tried a dozen\\nother promiscuous sources of information,-policemen, grooms, scribes,\\ndonkey-boys, and idlers in general. At length, wearied of patience, I\\noffered a soldier some pinches of tobacco, and promised him an Oriental\\nsixpence if he would manage the business for me. The man was interested\\nby the tobacco and the pence; he took my hand, and inquiring the while\\nhe went along, led me from place to place, till, mounting a grand\\nstaircase, I stood in the presence of Abbas Effendi, Naib or deputy to\\nthe Governor.\\n</p><p>It was a little, whey-faced, black-bearded Turk, coiled up in the usual\\nconglomerate posture upon a calico-covered diwan, at the end of a long,\\nbare, large- windowed room. Without deigning even to nod the head,\\nwhich hung over his shoulder with transcendent listlessness and\\naffectation of pride, in answer to my salams and benedictions, he eyed\\nme with wicked eyes, and faintly ejaculated \"Min ent[FN#8]?\" Then\\nhearing that I was a Darwaysh and doctor-he must be an Osmanli\\nVoltairean, that little Turk-the official snorted a contemptuous snort.\\nHe condescendingly added, however, that the proper source to seek was\\n\"Taht,\" which, meaning simply \"below,\" conveyed to an utter stranger\\nrather imperfect information from a topographical point of view.\\n</p><p>At length, however, my soldier guide found out that\\n</p><p>[p.22]a room in the custom-house bore the honourable appellation of\\n\"Foreign Office.\" Accordingly I went there, and, after sitting at least\\na couple of hours at the bolted door in the noon-day sun, was told,\\nwith a fury which made me think I had sinned, that the officer in whose\\ncharge the department was, had been presented with an olive branch in\\nthe morning, and consequently that business was not to be done that\\nday. The angry-faced official communicated the intelligence to a large\\ngroup of Anadolian, Caramanian, Bosniac, and Roumelian Turks,-sturdy,\\nundersized, broad-shouldered, bare-legged, splay-footed, horny-fisted,\\ndark-browed, honest-looking mountaineers, who were lounging about with\\nlong pistols and yataghans stuck in their broad sashes, head-gear\\ncomposed of immense tarbushes with proportionate turbands coiled round\\nthem, and bearing two or three suits of substantial clothes, even at\\nthis season of the year, upon their shoulders.\\n</p><p>Like myself they had waited some hours, but they were not so patient\\nunder disappointment: they bluntly told the angry official that he and\\nhis master were a pair of idlers, and the curses that rumbled and\\ngurgled in their hairy throats as they strode towards the door sounded\\nlike the growling of wild beasts.\\n</p><p>Thus was another day truly orientally lost. On the morrow, however, I\\nobtained permission, in the character of Dr. Abdullah, to visit any\\npart of Egypt I pleased, and to retain possession of my dagger and\\npistols.\\n</p><p>And now I must explain what induced me to take so much trouble about a\\npassport. The home reader naturally inquires, Why not travel under your\\nEnglish name?\\n</p><p>For this reason. In the generality of barbarous countries you must\\neither proceed, like Bruce, preserving the \"dignity of manhood,\" and\\ncarrying matters with a high hand, or you must worm your way by\\ntimidity and\\n</p><p>[p.23]subservience; in fact, by becoming an animal too contemptible for\\nman to let or injure. But to pass through the Moslem\\'s Holy Land, you\\nmust either be a born believer, or have become one; in the former case\\nyou may demean yourself as you please, in the latter a path is ready\\nprepared for you. My spirit could not bend to own myself a Burma,[FN#9]\\na renegade-to be pointed at and shunned and catechised, an object of\\nsuspicion to the many and of contempt to all. Moreover, it would have\\nobstructed the aim of my wanderings. The convert is always watched with\\nArgus eyes, and men do not willingly give information to a \"new\\nMoslem,\" especially a Frank: they suspect his conversion to be feigned\\nor forced, look upon him as a spy, and let him see as little of life as\\npossible. Firmly as was my heart set upon travelling in Arabia, by\\nHeaven! I would have given up the dear project rather than purchase a\\ndoubtful and partial success at such a price. Consequently, I had no\\nchoice but to appear as a born believer, and part of my birthright in\\nthat respectable character was toil and trouble in obtaining a\\nTazkirah.[FN#10]\\n</p><p>Then I had to provide myself with certain necessaries for the way.\\nThese were not numerous. The silver-mounted dressing-bag is here\\nsupplied by a rag containing a Miswak[FN#11] or tooth-stick, a bit of\\nsoap and a comb, wooden, for bone and tortoiseshell are not,\\nreligiously speaking, correct. Equally simple was my wardrobe; [p.24]a\\nchange or two of clothing. It is a great mistake to carry too few\\nclothes, and those who travel as Orientals should always have at least\\none very grand suit for use on critical occasions. Throughout the East\\na badly dressed man is a pauper, and, as in England, a pauper-unless he\\nbelongs to an order having a right to be poor-is a scoundrel. The only\\narticle of canteen description was a Zemzemiyah, a goat-skin water-bag,\\nwhich, especially when new, communicates to its contents a ferruginous\\naspect and a wholesome, though hardly an attractive, flavour of\\ntanno-gelatine. This was a necessary; to drink out of a tumbler,\\npossibly fresh from pig-eating lips, would have entailed a certain loss\\nof reputation. For bedding and furniture I had a coarse Persian\\nrug-which, besides being couch, acted as chair, table, and oratory-a\\ncotton-stuffed chintz-covered pillow, a blanket in case of cold, and a\\nsheet, which did duty for tent and mosquito curtains in nights of\\nheat.[FN#12] As shade is a convenience not always procurable, another\\nnecessary was a huge cotton umbrella of Eastern make, brightly yellow,\\nsuggesting the idea of an overgrown marigold. I had also a substantial\\nhousewife, the gift of a kind relative, Miss Elizabeth Stisted; it was\\na roll of canvas, carefully soiled, and garnished with needles and\\nthread, cobblers\\' wax, buttons, and other such articles. These things\\nwere most useful in lands where tailors abound not; besides which, the\\nsight of a man darning his coat or patching his slippers teems with\\npleasing ideas of humility. A dagger,[FN#13] a brass inkstand and\\npen-holder\\n</p><p>[p.25]stuck in the belt, and a mighty rosary, which on occasion might\\nhave been converted into a weapon of offence, completed my equipment. I\\nmust not omit to mention the proper method of carrying money, which in\\nthese lands should never be entrusted to box or bag. A common cotton\\npurse secured in a breast pocket (for Egypt now abounds in that\\ncivilised animal, the pick-pocket!), contained silver pieces and small\\nchange.[FN#14] My gold, of which I carried twenty-five sovereigns, and\\npapers, were committed to a substantial leathern belt of Maghrabi\\nmanufacture, made to be strapped round the waist under the dress. This\\nis the Asiatic method of concealing valuables, and one more civilised\\nthan ours in the last century, when Roderic Random and his companion\\n\"sewed their money between the lining and the waist-band of their\\nbreeches, except some loose silver for immediate\\n</p><p>[p.26]expense on the road.\" The great inconvenience of the belt is its\\nweight, especially where dollars must be carried, as in Arabia, causing\\nchafes and discomfort at night. Moreover, it can scarcely be called\\nsafe. In dangerous countries wary travellers will adopt surer\\nprecautions.\\n[FN#16]\\n</p><p>A pair of common native Khurjin, or saddle-bags, contained my wardrobe;\\nthe bed was readily rolled up into a bundle; and for a medicine\\nchest[FN#17] I bought a pea-green box with red and yellow flowers,\\ncapable of standing falls from a camel twice a day.\\n</p><p>[p.27]The next step was to find out when the local steamer would start\\nfor Cairo, and accordingly I betook myself to the Transit Office. No\\nvessel was advertised; I was directed to call every evening till\\nsatisfied. At last the fortunate event took place: a \"weekly\\ndeparture,\" which, by the bye, occurred once every fortnight or so, was\\nin orders for the next day. I hurried to the office, but did not reach\\nit till past noon-the hour of idleness. A little, dark gentleman-Mr.\\nGreen-so formed and dressed as exactly to resemble a liver-and-tan\\nbull-terrier, who with his heels on the table was dosing, cigar in\\nmouth, over the last \"Galignani,\" positively refused, after a time,-for\\nat first he would not speak at all,-to let me take my passage till\\nthree in the afternoon. I inquired when the boat started, upon which he\\nreferred me, as I had spoken bad Italian, to the advertisement. I\\npleaded inability to read or write, whereupon he testily cried Alle\\nnove! alle nove!-at nine! at nine! Still appearing uncertain, I drove\\nhim out of his chair, when he rose with a curse and read 8 A.M. An\\nunhappy Eastern, depending upon what he said, would have been precisely\\none hour too late.\\n</p><p>Thus were we lapsing into the real good old East-Indian style of doing\\nbusiness. Thus Anglo-Indicus orders his first clerk to execute some\\ncommission; the senior, having \"work\" upon his hands, sends a junior;\\nthe junior finds the sun hot, and passes on the word to a \"peon;\" the\\n\"peon\" charges a porter with the errand; and the porter quietly sits or\\ndoses in his place, trusting that Fate will bring him out of the\\nscrape, but firmly resolved, though the shattered globe fall, not to\\nstir an inch.\\n</p><p>The reader, I must again express a hope, will pardon the length of\\nthese descriptions,-my object is to show him how business is carried on\\nin these hot countries. Business generally. For had I been, not\\nAbdullah the Darwaysh, but a rich native merchant, it would have been\\n</p><p>[p.28]the same. How many complaints of similar treatment have I heard\\nin different parts of the Eastern world! and how little can one realise\\nthem without having actually experienced the evil! For the future I\\nshall never see a \"nigger\" squatting away half a dozen mortal hours in\\na broiling sun patiently waiting for something or for some one, without\\na lively remembrance of my own cooling of the calces at the\\ncustom-house of Alexandria.\\n</p><p>At length, about the end of May (1853) all was ready. Not without a\\nfeeling of regret I left my little room among the white myrtle blossoms\\nand the rosy oleander flowers with the almond smell. I kissed with\\nhumble ostentation my good host\\'s hand in presence of his servants-he\\nhad become somewhat unpleasantly anxious, of late, to induce in me the\\ntrue Oriental feeling, by a slight administration of the bastinado-I\\nbade adieu to my patients, who now amounted to about fifty, shaking\\nhands with all meekly and with religious equality of attention; and,\\nmounted in a \"trap\" which looked like a cross between a wheel-barrow\\nand a dog-cart, drawn by a kicking, jibbing, and biting mule, I set out\\nfor the steamer, the \"Little Asthmatic.\"\\n</p><p>[FN#1] The long pipe which at home takes the place of the shorter\\nchibuk used on the road.\\n[FN#2] The jubbah is a long outer garment, generally of cloth, worn by\\nlearned and respectable men. The za\\'abut is a large bag-sleeved black\\nor brown coloured robe made of home-spun woollen, the garb of the\\npeasant, the hedge-priest, and the darwaysh.\\n[FN#3] The mountain which encircles the globe, according to the sacred\\ngeography of the Moslems. To \"go to Kaf\" is equivalent to our \"go to\\nJericho,\" or-somewhere else.\\n[FN#4] Sir G. Wilkinson, referring his readers to Strabo, remarks that\\nthe \"troublesome system of passports seems to have been adopted by the\\nEgyptians at a very early period.\" Its present rigours, which have\\nlasted since the European troubles in 1848 and 1849, have a two-fold\\nobject; in the first place, to act as a clog upon the dangerous\\nemigrants which Germany, Italy, and Greece have sent out into the\\nworld; and secondly, to confine the subjects of the present Pasha of\\nEgypt to their fatherland and the habit of paying taxes. The\\nenlightened ruler (this was written during the rule of Abbas Pasha)\\nknows his own interests, and never willingly parts with a subject\\nliable to cess, at times objecting even to their obeying pilgrimage\\nlaw. We, on the other hand, in India, allow a freedom of emigration, in\\nmy humble opinion, highly injurious to us. For not only does this\\nexodus thin the population, and tend to impoverish the land, it also\\nserves to bring our rule into disrepute in foreign lands. At another\\ntime I shall discuss this subject more fully.\\n[FN#5] The glare of Alexandria has become a matter of fable in the\\nEast. The stucco employed in overlaying its walls, erected by\\nZul-karnayn, was so exquisitely tempered and so beautifully polished,\\nthat the inhabitants, in order to protect themselves from blindness,\\nwere constrained to wear masks.\\n[FN#6] The word literally means \"a bowman, an archer,\" reminding us of\\n\"les archers de la Sainte Hermandade,\" in the most delicious of modern\\nfictions. Some mis-spell the word \"Kawas,\" \"Cavass,\" and so forth!\\n[FN#7] A whip, a cravache of dried and twisted hippopotamus hide, the\\nferule, horsewhip, and \"cat o\\' nine tails\" of Egypt.\\n[FN#8] For \"man anta?\" who art thou?\\n[FN#9] An opprobrious name given by the Turks to their Christian\\nconverts. The word is derived from burmak, \"to twist, to turn.\"\\n[FN#10] During my journey, and since my return, some Indian papers\\nconducted by jocose editors made merry upon an Englishman \"turning\\nTurk.\" Once for all, I beg leave to point above for the facts of the\\ncase; it must serve as a general answer to any pleasant little fictions\\nwhich may hereafter appear.\\n[FN#11] A stick of soft wood chewed at one end. It is generally used\\nthroughout the East, where brushes should be avoided, as the natives\\nalways suspect hogs\\' bristles.\\n[FN#12] Almost all Easterns sleep under a sheet, which becomes a kind\\nof respirator, defending them from the dews and mosquitoes by night and\\nthe flies by day. The \"rough and ready\" traveller will learn to follow\\nthe example, remembering that \"Nature is founder of Customs in savage\\ncountries;\" whereas, amongst the soi-disant civilised, Nature has no\\ndeadlier enemy than Custom.\\n[FN#13] It is strictly forbidden to carry arms in Egypt. This, however,\\ndoes not prevent their being as necessary-especially in places like\\nAlexandria, where Greek and Italian ruffians abound-as they ever were\\nin Rome or Leghorn during the glorious times of Italian \"liberty.\"\\n[FN#14] In the Azhar Mosque, immediately after Friday service, a fellow\\nonce put his hand into my pocket, which fact alone is ample evidence of\\n\"progress.\"\\n[FN#15] As a general rule, always produce, when travelling, the\\nminutest bit of coin. At present, however, small change is dear in\\nEgypt; the Sarrafs, or money-changers, create the dearth in order to\\nclaim a high agio. The traveller must prepare himself for a most\\nunpleasant task in learning the different varieties of currency, which\\nappear all but endless, the result of deficiency in the national\\ncirculating medium. There are, however, few copper coins, the pieces of\\nten or five faddah (or parahs), whereas silver and gold abound. As\\nregards the latter metal, strangers should mistrust all small pieces,\\nTurkish as well as Egyptian. \"The greater part are either cut or\\ncracked, or perhaps both, and worn down to mere spangles: after taking\\nthem, it will not be possible to pass them without considerable loss.\"\\nAbove all things, the traveller must be careful never to change gold\\nexcept in large towns, where such a display of wealth would not arouse\\nsuspicion or cupidity; and on no occasion when travelling even to\\npronounce the ill-omened word \"Kis\" (purse). Many have lost their lives\\nby neglecting these simple precautions.\\n[FN#16] Some prefer a long chain of pure gold divided into links and\\ncovered with leather, so as to resemble the twisted girdle which the\\nArab fastens round his waist. It is a precaution well known to the\\nwandering knights of old. Others, again, in very critical situations,\\nopen with a lancet the shoulder, or any other fleshy part of the body,\\nand insert a precious stone, which does not show in its novel purse.\\n[FN#17] Any \"Companion to the Medicine Chest\" will give, to those that\\nrequire such information, the names of drugs and instruments necessary\\nfor a journey; but it must be borne in mind that hot countries require\\ndouble quantities of tonics, and half the allowance of cathartics\\nnecessary in cold climates. Sonnini, however, is right when he says of\\nthe Egyptian fellahs, that their stomachs, accustomed to digest bread\\nbadly baked, acrid and raw vegetables, and other green and unwholesome\\nnourishment, require doses fit only for horses. Advisable precautions\\nare, in the first place, to avoid, if travelling as a native, any signs\\nof European manufacture in knives, scissors, weights, scales and other\\nsuch articles. Secondly, glass bottles are useless: the drugs should be\\nstowed away in tin or wooden boxes, such as the natives of the country\\nuse, and when a phial is required, it must be fitted into an etui of\\nsome kind. By this means, ground glass stoppers and plentiful cotton\\nstuffing, the most volatile essences may be carried about without great\\nwaste. After six months of the driest heat, in Egypt and Arabia, not\\nmore than about one-fourth of my Prussic acid and chloroform had\\nevaporated. And, thirdly, if you travel in the East, a few bottles of\\ntincture of cantharides-highly useful as a rubefacient, excitant, et\\ncetera-must never be omitted. I made the mistake of buying my drugs in\\nEngland, and had the useless trouble of looking after them during the\\njourney. Both at Alexandria and Cairo they are to be found in\\nabundance, cheaper than in London, and good enough for all practical\\npurposes.\\n</p>\\n<h2><span id=\"Chapter_III._THE_NILE_STEAMBOAT-THE_.22LITTLE_ASTHMATIC..22\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Chapter_III._THE_NILE_STEAMBOAT-THE_&quot;LITTLE_ASTHMATIC.&quot;\">Chapter III.

THE NILE STEAMBOAT-THE &quot;LITTLE ASTHMATIC.&quot;\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\\n<p>IN the days of the Pitts we have invariably a \"Relation\" of Egyptian\\ntravellers who embark for a place called \"Roseet\" on the \"River Nilus.\"\\nWanderers of the Brucean age were wont to record their impressions of\\nvoyage upon land subjects observed between Alexandria and Cairo. A\\nlittle later we find every one inditing rhapsodies about, and\\ndescriptions of, his or her Dahabiyah (barge) on the canal. After this\\ncame the steamer. And after the steamer will come the railroad, which\\nmay disappoint the author tourist, but will be delightful to that\\nsensible class of men who wish to get over the greatest extent of\\nground with the least inconvenience to themselves and others. Then\\nshall the Mahmudiyah-ugliest and most wearisome of canals-be given up\\nto cotton boats and grain barges, and then will note-books and the\\nheadings of chapters clean ignore its existence.\\n</p><p>I saw the canal at its worst, when the water was low; and I have not\\none syllable to say in its favour. Instead of thirty hours, we took\\nthree mortal days and nights to reach Cairo, and we grounded with\\npainful regularity four or five times between sunrise and sunset. In\\nthe scenery on the banks sketchers and describers have left you nought\\nto see. From Pompey\\'s Pillar to the Maison Carree, Kariom and its\\npotteries, Al-Birkah[FN#1] of the night birds, Bastarah\\n</p><p>[p.30]with the alleys of trees, even unto Atfah, all things are\\nperfectly familiar to us, and have been so years before the traveller\\nactually sees them. The Nil al-Mubarak itself-the Blessed Nile,-as\\nnotably fails too at this season to arouse enthusiasm. You see nothing\\nbut muddy waters, dusty banks, a sand mist, a milky sky, and a glaring\\nsun: you feel nought but a breeze like the blast from a potter\\'s\\nfurnace. You can only just distinguish through a veil of reeking\\nvapours the village Shibr Katt from the village Kafr al-Zayyat, and you\\nsteam too far from Wardan town to enjoy the Timonic satisfaction of\\nenraging its male population with \"Haykal! ya ibn Haykal! O Haykal!-O\\nson of Haykal[FN#2]!\" You are nearly wrecked, as a matter of course, at\\nthe Barrage; and you are certainly dumbfoundered by the sight of its\\nugly little Gothic crenelles.[FN#3] The Pyramids of Khufa and Khafra\\n(Cheops\\n</p><p>[p.31]and Cephren) \"rearing their majestic heads above the margin of\\nthe Desert,\" only suggest of remark that they have been remarkably\\nwell-sketched; and thus you proceed till with a real feeling of\\nsatisfaction you moor alongside of the tumble-down old suburb \"Bulak.\"\\n</p><p>To me there was double dulness in the scenery: it seemed to be Sind\\nover again-the same morning mist and noon-tide glare; the same hot wind\\nand heat clouds, and fiery sunset, and evening glow; the same pillars\\nof dust and \"devils\" of sand sweeping like giants over the plain; the\\nsame turbid waters of a broad, shallow stream studded with sand-banks\\nand silt-isles, with crashing earth slips and ruins nodding over a kind\\nof cliff, whose base the stream gnaws with noisy tooth. On the banks,\\nsaline ground sparkled and glittered like hoar-frost in the sun; and\\nhere and there mud villages, solitary huts, pigeon-towers, or watch\\nturrets, whence little brown boys shouted and slung stones at the\\nbirds, peeped out from among bright green patches of palm-tree,\\ntamarisk, and mimosa, of maize, tobacco, and sugar-cane. Beyond the\\nnarrow tongue of land on the river banks lay the glaring, yellow\\nDesert, with its low hills and sand slopes, bounded by innumerable\\npyramids of Nature\\'s architecture. The boats, with their sharp bows,\\npreposterous sterns, and lateen sails, might have belonged to the\\nIndus. So might the chocolate-skinned, blue-robed peasantry; the women\\ncarrying progeny on their hips, with the eternal waterpot on their\\nheads; and the men sleeping in the shade or following the plough, to\\nwhich probably Osiris first put hand. The lower animals, like the\\nhigher, were the same; gaunt, mange-stained camels, muddy buffaloes,\\nscurvied donkeys, sneaking jackals, and fox-like dogs. Even the\\nfeathered creatures were perfectly familiar to my eye-\\n</p><p>[p.32]paddy birds, pelicans, giant cranes, kites and wild water-fowl.\\n</p><p>I had taken a third-class or deck-passage, whereby the evils of the\\njourney were exasperated. A roasting sun pierced the canvas awning like\\nhot water through a gauze veil, and by night the cold dews fell raw and\\nthick as a Scotch mist. The cooking was abominable, and the dignity of\\nDarwaysh-hood did not allow me to sit at meat with Infidels or to eat\\nthe food which they had polluted. So the Pilgrim squatted apart,\\nsmoking perpetually, with occasional interruptions to say his prayers\\nand to tell his beads upon the mighty rosary; and he drank the muddy\\nwater of the canal out of a leathern bucket, and he munched his bread\\nand garlic[FN#4] with a desperate sanctimoniousness.\\n</p><p>The \"Little Asthmatic\" was densely crowded, and discipline not daring\\nto mark out particular places, the scene on board of her was motley\\nenough. There were two Indian officers, who naturally spoke to none but\\neach other, drank bad tea, and smoked their cigars exclusively\\n</p><p>[p.33]like Britons. A troop of the Kurd Kawwas,[FN#5] escorting\\ntreasure, was surrounded by a group of noisy Greeks; these men\\'s gross\\npractical jokes sounding anything but pleasant to the solemn Moslems,\\nwhose saddle-bags and furniture were at every moment in danger of being\\ndefiled by abominable drinks and the ejected juices of tobacco. There\\nwas one pretty woman on board, a Spanish girl, who looked strangely\\nmisplaced-a rose in a field of thistles. Some silent Italians, with\\nnoisy interpreters, sat staidly upon the benches. It was soon found\\nout, through the communicative dragoman, that their business was to buy\\nhorses for H. M. of Sardinia: they were exposed to a volley of\\nquestions delivered by a party of French tradesmen returning to Cairo,\\nbut they shielded themselves and fought shy with Machiavellian\\ndexterity. Besides these was a German, a \"beer-bottle in the morning\\nand a bottle of beer in the evening,\" to borrow a simile from his own\\nnation; a Syrian merchant, the richest and ugliest of Alexandria; and a\\nfew French house-painters going to decorate the Pasha\\'s palace at\\nShubra. These last were the happiest of our voyagers,-veritable\\nchildren of Paris, Montagnards, Voltaireans, and thoroughbred\\nSans-Soucis. All day they sat upon deck chattering as only their lively\\nnation can chatter, indulging in ultra-gallic maxims, such as \"on ne\\nvieillit jamais a table;\" now playing ecarte for love or nothing, then\\ncomposing \"des ponches un peu chiques;\" now reciting adventures of the\\ncategory \"Mirabolant,\" then singing, then dancing, then sleeping, and\\nrising to play, to drink, talk, dance, and sing again. One chaunted:\\n</p><p>\"Je n\\'ai pas connu mon pere\\nCe respectable vieillard.\\nJe suis ne trois ans trop tard,\" &amp;.;\\n</p><p>Whilst another trolled out:\\n</p><p>\"Qu\\'est ce que je vois?\\nUn canard en robe de chambre!\"\\n</p><p>[p.34]They being new comers, free from the western morgue so soon\\ncaught by Oriental Europeans, were particularly civil to me, even\\nwishing to mix me a strong draught; but I was not so fortunate with all\\non board. A large shopkeeper threatened to \"briser\" my \"figure\" for\\nputting my pipe near his pantaloons; but seeing me finger my dagger\\ncuriously, though I did not shift my pipe, he forgot to remember his\\nthreat. I had taken charge of a parcel for one M. P-, a student of\\nCoptic, and remitted it to him on board; of this little service the\\nonly acknowledgment was a stare and a petulant inquiry why I had not\\ngiven it to him before. And one of the Englishmen, half publicly, half\\nprivily, as though communing with himself, condemned my organs of\\nvision because I happened to touch his elbow. He was a man in my own\\nservice; I pardoned him in consideration of the compliment paid to my\\ndisguise.\\n</p><p>Two fellow-passengers were destined to play an important part in my\\ncomedy of Cairo. Just after we had started, a little event afforded us\\nsome amusement. On the bank appeared a short, crummy, pursy kind of\\nman, whose efforts to board the steamer were notably ridiculous. With\\nattention divided between the vessel and a carpet-bag carried by his\\ndonkey boy, he ran along the sides of the canal, now stumbling into\\nhollows, then climbing heights, then standing shouting upon the\\nprojections with the fierce sun upon his back, till everyone thought\\nhis breath was completely gone. But no! game to the backbone, he would\\nhave perished miserably rather than lose his fare: \"patience and\\nperseverance,\" say the wise, \"got a wife for his Reverence.\" At last he\\nwas taken on board, and presently he lay down to sleep. His sooty\\ncomplexion, lank black hair, features in which appeared beaucoup de\\nfinesse, that is to say, abundant rascality, an eternal smile and\\ntreacherous eyes, his gold[FN#6] ring, dress\\n</p><p>[p.35]of showy colours, fleshy stomach, fat legs, round back, and a\\npeculiar manner of frowning and fawning simultaneously, marked him an\\nIndian. When he awoke he introduced himself to me as Miyan Khudabakhsh\\nNamdar, a native of Lahore: he had carried on the trade of a shawl\\nmerchant in London and Paris, where he had lived two years, and, after\\na pilgrimage intended to purge away the sins of civilised lands, he had\\nsettled at Cairo.\\n</p><p>My second friend, Haji Wali, I will introduce to the reader in a future\\nchapter; and my two expeditions to Midian have brought him once more\\ninto notice.[FN#7]\\n</p><p>Long conversations in Persian and Hindustani abridged the tediousness\\nof the voyage, and when we arrived at Bulak, the polite Khudabakhsh\\ninsisted upon my making his house my home. I was unwilling to accept\\nthe man\\'s civility, disliking his looks; but he advanced cogent reasons\\nfor changing my mind. His servant cleared my luggage through the\\ncustom-house, and a few minutes after our arrival I found myself in his\\nabode near the Azbakiyah Gardens, sitting in a cool Mashrabiyah[FN#8]\\nthat gracefully projected over a garden, and sipping the favourite\\nglass of pomegranate syrup.\\n</p><p>As the Wakalahs or Caravanserais were at that time full of pilgrims, I\\nremained with Khudabakhsh ten days or a fortnight. But at the end of\\nthat time my patience was thoroughly exhausted. My host had become a\\ncivilised man, who sat on chairs, who ate with a fork, who talked\\nEuropean politics, and who had learned to admire, if not to understand,\\nliberty-liberal ideas! and was I not flying from such things? Besides\\nwhich, we English have a\\n</p><p>[p.36]peculiar national quality, which the Indians, with their\\ncharacteristic acuteness, soon perceived, and described by an\\nopprobrious name. Observing our solitary habits, that we could not, and\\nwould not, sit and talk and sip sherbet and smoke with them, they\\ncalled us \"Jangli\"-wild men, fresh caught in the jungle and sent to\\nrule over the land of Hind.[FN#9] Certainly nothing suits us less than\\nperpetual society, an utter want of solitude, when one cannot retire\\ninto oneself an instant without being asked some puerile question by a\\ncompanion, or look into a book without a servant peering over one\\'s\\nshoulder; when from the hour you rise to the time you rest, you must\\never be talking or listening, you must converse yourself to sleep in a\\npublic dormitory, and give ear to your companions\\' snores and\\nmutterings at midnight.[FN#10]\\n</p><p>The very essence of Oriental hospitality, however, is this family style\\nof reception, which costs your host neither coin nor trouble. I speak\\nof the rare tracts in which the old barbarous hospitality still\\nlingers. You make one more at his eating tray, and an additional\\nmattress appears in the sleeping-room. When you depart, you leave if\\nyou like a little present, merely for a memorial, with your\\nentertainer; he would be offended if you offered it him openly as a\\nremuneration, and you give\\n</p><p>[p.37]some trifling sums to the servants. Thus you will be welcome\\nwherever you go. If perchance you are detained perforce in such a\\nsituation,-which may easily happen to you, medical man,-you have only\\nto make yourself as disagreeable as possible, by calling for all manner\\nof impossible things. Shame is a passion with Eastern nations. Your\\nhost would blush to point out to you the indecorum of your conduct; and\\nthe laws of hospitality oblige him to supply the every want of a guest,\\neven though he be a detenu.\\n</p><p>But of all Orientals, the most antipathetical companion to an\\nEnglishman is, I believe, an East-Indian. Like the fox in the fable,\\nfulsomely flattering at first, he gradually becomes easily friendly,\\ndisagreeably familiar, offensively rude, which ends by rousing the\\n\"spirit of the British lion.\" Nothing delights the Hindi so much as an\\nopportunity of safely venting the spleen with which he regards his\\nvictors.[FN#11] He will sit in the presence of a\\n</p><p>[p.38]magistrate, or an officer, the very picture of cringing\\nsubmissiveness. But after leaving the room, he is as different from his\\nformer self as a counsel in court from a counsel at a concert, a sea\\ncaptain at a club dinner from a sea captain on his quarter-deck. Then\\nhe will discover that the English are not brave, nor clever, nor\\ngenerous, nor civilised, nor anything but surpassing rogues; that every\\nofficial takes bribes, that their manners are utterly offensive, and\\nthat they are rank infidels. Then he will descant complacently upon the\\nprobability of a general Bartholomew\\'s Day in the East, and look\\nforward to the hour when enlightened Young India will arise and drive\\nthe \"foul invader\" from the land.[FN#12] Then he will submit his\\npolitical opinions nakedly, that India should be wrested from the\\nCompany and given to the Queen, or taken from the Queen and given to\\nthe French. If the Indian has been a European traveller, so much the\\nworse for you. He has blushed to own,-explaining, however , conquest by\\nbribery,-that 50,000 Englishmen hold 150,000,000 of his compatriots in\\nthrall, and for aught you know, republicanism may have become his idol.\\nHe has lost all fear of the white face, and having been accustomed to\\nunburden his mind in\\n</p><p>\"The land where, girt by friend or foe,\\nA man may say the thing he will,\"-\\n</p><p>he pursues the same course in other lands where it is exceedingly\\nmisplaced. His doctrines of liberty and\\n</p><p>[p.39]equality he applies to you personally and practically, by not\\nrising when you enter or leave the room,-at first you could scarcely\\ninduce him to sit down,-by not offering you his pipe, by turning away\\nwhen you address him; in fact, by a variety of similar small affronts\\nwhich none knows better to manage skilfully and with almost impalpable\\ngradations. If-and how he prays for it!-an opportunity of refusing you\\nanything presents itself, he does it with an\\n</p><p>\"In rice strength,\\nIn an Indian manliness,[FN#13]\"\\n</p><p>say the Arabs. And the Persians apply the following pithy tale to their\\nneighbours. \"Brother,\" said the leopard to the jackal, \"I crave a few\\nof thy cast-off hairs; I want them for medicine;[FN#14] where can I\\nfind them?\" \"Wa\\'llahi!\" replied the jackal, \"I don\\'t exactly know-I\\nseldom change my coat-I wander about the hills. Allah is\\nbounteous,[FN#15] brother! hairs are not so easily shed.\"\\n</p><p>Woe to the unhappy Englishman, Pasha, or private soldier, who must\\nserve an Eastern lord! Worst of all, if the master be an Indian, who,\\nhating all Europeans,[FN#16]\\n[p.40]adds an especial spite to Oriental coarseness, treachery, and\\ntyranny. Even the experiment of associating with them is almost too\\nhard to bear. But a useful deduction may be drawn from such\\nobservations; and as few have had greater experience than myself, I\\nventure to express my opinion with confidence, however unpopular or\\nunfashionable it may be.\\n</p><p>I am convinced that the natives of India cannot respect a European who\\nmixes with them familiarly, or especially who imitates their customs,\\nmanners, and dress. The tight pantaloons, the authoritative voice, the\\npococurante manner, and the broken Hindustani impose upon them-have a\\nweight which learning and honesty, which wit and courage, have not.\\nThis is to them the master\\'s attitude: they bend to it like those\\nScythian slaves that faced the sword but fled from the horsewhip. Such\\nwould never be the case amongst a brave people, the Afghan for\\ninstance; and for the same reason it is not so, we read, with \"White\\nPlume,\" the North American Indian. \"The free trapper combines in the\\neye of an Indian (American) girl, all that is dashing and heroic in a\\nwarrior of her own race, whose gait and garb and bravery he emulates,\\nwith all that is gallant and glorious in the white man.\" There is but\\none cause for this phenomenon; the \"imbelles Indi\" are still, with few\\nexceptions,[FN#17] a cowardly and slavish people, who would raise\\nthemselves by depreciating those superior to them in the scale of\\ncreation. The Afghans and American aborigines, being chivalrous races,\\nrather exaggerate the valour of their foes, because by so doing they\\nexalt their own.[FN#18]\\n</p><p>[FN#1] Villages notorious for the peculiar Egyptian revelry, an\\nundoubted relic of the good old times, when \"the most religious of men\"\\nrevelled at Canopus with an ardent piety in honour of Isis and Osiris.\\n[FN#2] \"Haykal\" was a pleasant fellow, who, having basely abused the\\nconfidence of the fair ones of Wardan, described their charms in\\nsarcastic verse, and stuck his scroll upon the door of the village\\nmosque, taking at the same time the wise precaution to change his\\nlodgings without delay. The very mention of his name affronts the brave\\nWardanenses to the last extent, making them savage as Oxford bargees.\\n[FN#3] The Barrage is a handsome bridge,-putting the style of\\narchitecture out of consideration,-the work of French engineers,\\noriginally projected by Napoleon the First. It was intended to act as a\\ndam, raising the waters of the Nile and conducting them to Suez, the\\nsalt lakes, and a variety of other places, through a number of canals,\\nwhich, however, have not yet been opened. Meanwhile, it acts upon the\\nriver\\'s trunk as did the sea of old upon its embouchures, blocking it\\nup and converting the land around it to the condition of a swamp.\\nMoreover, it would have cleaned out the bed by means of sluice gates,\\nforming an artificial increase of current to draw off the deposit; but\\nthe gates are wanting, so the piers, serving only to raise the soil by\\nincreasing the deposit of silt, collect and detain suspended matter,\\nwhich otherwise would not settle. Briefly, by a trifling expenditure\\nthe Barrage might be made a blessing to Egypt; in its present state it\\nis a calamity, an \"enormous, cruel wonder,\" more crushing to the people\\nthan were the pyramids and sphinxes of old.\\n[FN#4] Those skilled in simples, Eastern as well as Western, praise\\ngarlic highly, declaring that it \"strengthens the body, prepares the\\nconstitution for fatigue, brightens the sight, and, by increasing the\\ndigestive power, obviates the ill-effects arising from sudden change of\\nair and water.\" The traveller inserts it into his dietary in some\\npleasant form, as \"Provence-butter,\" because he observes that, wherever\\nfever and ague abound, the people, ignorant of cause but observant of\\neffect, make it a common article of food. The old Egyptians highly\\nesteemed this vegetable, which, with onions and leeks, enters into the\\nlist of articles so much regretted by the Hebrews (Numbers, xi. 5;\\nKoran, chap. 2). The modern people of the Nile, like the Spaniards,\\ndelight in onions, which, as they contain between 25 and 30 per cent.\\nof gluten, are highly nutritive. In Arabia, however, the stranger must\\nuse this vegetable sparingly. The city people despise it as the food of\\na Fellah-a boor. The Wahhabis have a prejudice against onions, leeks,\\nand garlic, because the Prophet disliked their strong smell, and all\\nstrict Moslems refuse to eat them immediately before visiting the\\nmosque, or meeting for public prayer.\\n[FN#5] A policeman; see Chap. I.\\n[FN#6] The stricter sort of Moslems, such as the Arabs, will not wear\\ngold ornaments, which are forbidden by their law.\\n[FN#7] See \"The Gold Mines of Midian,\" and \"The Land of Midian\\n(Revisited),\" by Sir R.

A. Irving\\'s Prize Essay on the Theory and Practice of\\nCaste.) Hence, nothing can be more terrible to a man than expulsion\\nfrom caste; the excommunication of our feudal times was not a more\\ndreadful form of living death.\\n[FN#10] With us every man\\'s house is his castle. But caste divides a\\npeople into huge families, each member of which has a right to know\\neverything about his \"caste-brother,\" because a whole body might be\\npolluted and degraded by the act of an individual. Hence, there is no\\nsuch thing as domestic privacy, and no system of espionnage devised by\\nrulers could be so complete as that self-imposed by the Hindus.\\n[FN#11] The Calcutta Review (No. 41), noticing \"L\\'Inde sous la\\nDomination Anglaise,\" by the Baron Barchou de Penho\\xef\\xbf\\xbdn, delivers the\\nfollowing sentiment: \"Whoever states, as the Baron B. de P. states and\\nrepeats, again and again, that the natives generally entertain a bad\\nopinion of the Europeans generally, states what is decidedly untrue.\"\\nThe reader will observe that I differ as decidedly from the Reviewer\\'s\\nopinion. Popular feeling towards the English in India was \"at first one\\nof fear, afterwards of horror: Hindus and Hindis (Moslems) considered\\nthe strangers a set of cow-eaters and fire-drinkers, tetrae beluae ac\\nmolossis suis ferociores, who would fight like Iblis, cheat their own\\nfathers, and exchange with the same readiness a broadside of shots and\\nthrusts of boarding-pikes, or a bale of goods and a bag of rupees.\"\\n(Rev.

We have risen in a\\ndegree above such a low standard of estimation; still, incredible as it\\nmay appear to the Frank himself, it is no less true, that the Frank\\neverywhere in the East is considered a contemptible being, and\\ndangerous withal.

At the same time I am convinced that in other places\\nthe people would most willingly hail any change.

LIFE IN THE WAKALAH.\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\\n<p>THE \"Wakalah,\" as the Caravanserai or Khan is called in Egypt, combines\\nthe offices of hotel, lodging-house, and store. It is at Cairo, as at\\nConstantinople, a massive pile of buildings surrounding a quadrangular\\n\"Hosh\" or court-yard. On the ground-floor are rooms like caverns for\\nmerchandise, and shops of different kinds-tailors, cobblers, bakers,\\ntobacconists, fruiterers, and others. A roofless gallery or a covered\\nverandah, into which all the apartments open, runs round the first and\\nsometimes the second story: the latter, however, is usually exposed to\\nthe sun and wind. The accommodations consist of sets of two or three\\nrooms, generally an inner one and an outer; the latter contains a\\nhearth for cooking, a bathing-place, and similar necessaries. The\\nstaircases are high, narrow, and exceedingly dirty; dark at night, and\\noften in bad repair; a goat or donkey is tethered upon the different\\nlandings; here and there a fresh skin is stretched in process of\\ntanning, and the smell reminds the veteran traveller of those closets\\nin the old French\\n</p><p>[p.42]inns where cat used to be prepared for playing the part of jugged\\nhare. The interior is unfurnished; even the pegs upon which clothes are\\nhung have been pulled down for fire-wood: the walls are bare but for\\nstains, thick cobwebs depend in festoons from the blackened rafters of\\nthe ceiling, and the stone floor would disgrace a civilised prison: the\\nwindows are huge apertures carefully barred with wood or iron, and in\\nrare places show remains of glass or paper pasted over the framework.\\nIn the court-yard the poorer sort of travellers consort with tethered\\nbeasts of burden, beggars howl, and slaves lie basking and scratching\\nthemselves upon mountainous heaps of cotton bales and other merchandise.\\n</p><p>This is not a tempting picture, yet is the Wakalah a most amusing\\nplace, presenting a succession of scenes which would delight lovers of\\nthe Dutch school-a rich exemplification of the grotesque, and what is\\ncalled by artists the \"dirty picturesque.\"\\n</p><p>I could find no room in the Wakalah Khan Khalil, the Long\\'s, or\\nMeurice\\'s of native Cairo; I was therefore obliged to put up with the\\nJamaliyah, a Greek quarter, swarming with drunken Christians, and\\ntherefore about as fashionable as Oxford Street or Covent Garden. Even\\nfor this I had to wait a week. The pilgrims were flocking to Cairo, and\\nto none other would the prudent hotel keepers open their doors, for the\\nfollowing sufficient reasons. When you enter a Wakalah, the first thing\\nyou have to do is to pay a small sum, varying from two to five\\nshillings, for the Miftah (the key). This is generally equivalent to a\\nmonth\\'s rent; so the sooner you leave the house the better for it. I\\nwas obliged to call myself a Turkish pilgrim in order to get possession\\nof two most comfortless rooms, which I afterwards learned were\\ncelebrated for making travellers ill; and I had to pay eighteen\\npiastres for the key and eighteen ditto per mensem for\\n</p><p>[p.43]rent, besides five piastres to the man who swept and washed the\\nplace. So that for this month my house-hire amounted to nearly four\\npence a day.\\n</p><p>But I was fortunate enough in choosing the Jamaliyah Wakalah, for I\\nfound a friend there. On board the steamer a fellow-voyager, seeing me\\nsitting alone and therefore as he conceived in discomfort, placed\\nhimself by my side and opened a hot fire of kind inquiries. He was a\\nman about forty-five, of middle size, with a large round head closely\\nshaven, a bull-neck, limbs sturdy as a Saxon\\'s, a thin red beard, and\\nhandsome features beaming with benevolence. A curious dry humour he\\nhad, delighting in \"quizzing,\" but in so quiet, solemn, and quaint a\\nway that before you knew him you could scarcely divine his drift.\\n</p><p>\"Thank Allah, we carry a doctor!\" said my friend more than once, with\\napparent fervour of gratitude, after he had discovered my profession. I\\nwas fairly taken in by the pious ejaculation, and some days elapsed\\nbefore the drift of his remark became apparent.\\n</p><p>\"You doctors,\" he explained, when we were more intimate, \"what do you\\ndo? A man goes to you for ophthalmia: it is a purge, a blister, and a\\ndrop in the eye! Is it for fever? well! a purge and kinakina (quinine).\\nFor dysentery? a purge and extract of opium. Wa\\'llahi! I am as good a\\nphysician as the best of you,\" he would add with a broad grin, \"if I\\nonly knew the Dirham-birhams,[FN#1]-drams and drachms,-and a few\\nbreak-jaw Arabic names of diseases.\"\\n</p><p>Haji Wali[FN#2] therefore emphatically advised me to\\n</p><p>[p.44]make bread by honestly teaching languages. \"We are\\ndoctor-ridden,\" said he, and I found it was the case.\\n</p><p>When we lived under the same roof, the Haji and I became fast friends.\\nDuring the day we called on each other frequently, we dined together,\\nand passed the evening in a Mosque, or some other place of public\\npastime. Coyly at first, but less guardedly as we grew bolder, we\\nsmoked the forbidden weed \"Hashish,[FN#3]\" conversing lengthily the\\nwhile about that world of which I had seen so much. Originally from\\nRussia, he also had been a traveller, and in his wanderings he had cast\\noff most of the prejudices of his people. \"I believe in Allah and his\\nProphet, and in nothing else,\" was his sturdy creed; he rejected\\nalchemy, jinnis and magicians, and truly he had a most unoriental\\ndistaste for tales of wonder. When I entered the Wakalah, he\\nconstituted himself my cicerone, and especially guarded me against the\\ncheating of trades-men. By his advice I laid aside the Darwaysh\\'s gown,\\nthe large blue pantaloons, and the short shirt; in fact all connection\\nwith Persia and the Persians. \"If you persist in being an \\'Ajami,\" said\\nthe Haji, \"you will get yourself into trouble; in Egypt you will be\\ncursed; in Arabia you will be beaten because you are a heretic; you\\nwill pay the treble of what other travellers do, and if you fall sick\\nyou may die by the roadside.\" After long deliberation about\\n</p><p>[p.45]the choice of nations, I became a \"Pathan.[FN#4]\" Born in India\\nof Afghan parents, who had settled in the country, educated at Rangoon,\\nand sent out to wander, as men of that race frequently are, from early\\nyouth, I was well guarded against the danger of detection by a\\nfellow-countryman. To support the character requires a knowledge of\\nPersian, Hindustani and Arabic, all of which I knew sufficiently well\\nto pass muster; any trifling inaccuracy was charged upon my long\\nresidence at Rangoon. This was an important step; the first question at\\nthe shop, on the camel, and in the Mosque, is \"What is thy name?\" the\\nsecond, \"Whence comest thou?\" This is not generally impertinent, or\\nintended to be annoying; if, however, you see any evil intention in the\\nquestioner, you may rather roughly ask him, \"What may be his maternal\\nparent\\'s name?\"-equivalent to enquiring, Anglice, in what church his\\nmother was married,-and escape your difficulties under cover of the\\nstorm. But this is rarely necessary. I assumed the polite, pliant\\nmanners of an Indian physician, and the dress of a small Effendi (or\\ngentleman), still, however, representing myself to be a Darwaysh, and\\nfrequenting the places where Darwayshes congregate. \"What business,\"\\nasked the Haji, \"have those reverend men with politics or statistics,\\nor any of the information which you are collecting? Call yourself a\\nreligious wanderer if you like, and let those who ask the object of\\nyour peregrinations know that you are under a vow to visit all the holy\\nplaces in Al-Islam. Thus you will persuade them that you are a\\n</p><p>[p.46]man of rank under a cloud, and you will receive much more\\ncivility than perhaps you deserve,\" concluded my friend with a dry\\nlaugh. The remark proved his sagacity; and after ample experience I had\\nnot to repent having been guided by his advice.\\n</p><p>Haji Wali, by profession a merchant at Alexandria, had accompanied\\nKhudabakhsh, the Indian, to Cairo on law-business. He soon explained\\nhis affairs to me, and as his case brought out certain Oriental\\npeculiarities in a striking light, with his permission I offer a few of\\nits details.\\n</p><p>My friend was defendant in a suit instituted against him in H.B.M.\\'s\\nConsular Court, Cairo, by one Mohammed Shafi\\'a, a scoundrel of the\\nfirst water. This man lived, and lived well, by setting up in business\\nat places where his name was not known; he enticed the unwary by artful\\ndisplays of capital; and, after succeeding in getting credit, he\\nchanged residence, carrying off all he could lay hands upon. But\\nswindling is a profession of personal danger in uncivilised countries,\\nwhere law punishes pauper debtors by a short imprisonment; and where\\nthe cheated prefer to gratify their revenge by the cudgel or the knife.\\nSo Mohammed Shafi\\'a, after a few narrow escapes, hit upon a prime\\nexpedient. Though known to be a native of Bokhara-he actually signed\\nhimself so in his letters, and his appearance at once bespoke his\\norigin,-he determined to protect himself by a British passport. Our\\nofficials are sometimes careless enough in distributing these\\ndocuments, and by so doing they expose themselves to a certain loss of\\nreputation at Eastern courts[FN#5]; still Mohammed Shafi\\'a\\n</p><p>[p.47]found some difficulties in effecting his fraud. To recount all\\nhis Reynardisms would weary the reader; suffice it to say that by\\nproper management of the subalterns in the consulate, he succeeded\\nwithout ruining himself. Armed with this new defence, he started boldly\\nfor Jeddah on the Arabian coast. Having entered into partnership with\\nHaji Wali, whose confidence he had won by prayers, fastings, and\\npilgrimages, he openly trafficked in slaves, sending them to Alexandria\\nfor sale, and writing with matchless impudence to his correspondent\\nthat he would dispose of them in person, but for fear of losing his\\nBritish passport and protection.\\n</p><p>Presently an unlucky adventure embroiled this worthy British subject\\nwith Faraj Yusuf, the principal merchant of Jeddah, and also an English\\nprotege. Fearing so powerful an adversary, Mohammed Shafi\\'a packed up\\nhis spoils and departed for Egypt. Presently he quarrels with his\\nformer partner, thinking him a soft man, and claims from him a debt of\\nL165. He supports his pretensions by a document and four witnesses, who\\nare ready to swear that the receipt in question was \"signed, sealed,\\nand delivered\" by Haji Wali. The latter adduces his books to show that\\naccounts have been settled, and can prove that the witnesses in\\nquestion are paupers, therefore, not legal; moreover, that each has\\nreceived from the plaintiff two dollars, the price of perjury.\\n</p><p>[p.48]Now had such a suit been carried into a Turkish court of justice,\\nit would very sensibly have been settled by the bastinado, for Haji\\nWali was a respectable merchant, and Mohammed Shafi\\'a a notorious\\nswindler. But the latter was a British subject, which notably\\ninfluenced the question. The more to annoy his adversary, he went up to\\nCairo, and began proceedings there, hoping by this acute step to\\nreceive part payment of his demand.\\n</p><p>Arrived at Cairo, Mohammed Shafi\\'a applied himself stoutly to the task\\nof bribing all who could be useful to him, distributing shawls and\\npiastres with great generosity. He secured the services of an efficient\\nlawyer; and, determining to enlist heaven itself in his cause, he\\npassed the Ramazan ostentatiously; he fasted, and he slaughtered sheep\\nto feed the poor.\\n</p><p>Meanwhile Haji Wali, a simple truth-telling man, who could never master\\nthe rudiments of that art which teaches man to blow hot and to blow\\ncold with the same breath, had been persuaded to visit Cairo by\\nKhudabakhsh, the wily Indian, who promised to introduce him to\\ninfluential persons, and to receive him in his house till he could\\nprovide himself with a lodging at the Wakalah. But Mohammed Shafi\\'a,\\nwho had once been in partnership with the Indian, and who possibly knew\\nmore than was fit to meet the public ear, found this out; and, partly\\nby begging, partly by bullying, persuaded Khudabakhsh to transfer the\\ninfluential introductions to himself. Then the Hakim[FN#6]\\nAbdullah-your humble servant-appears upon the scene: he has travelled\\nin Feringistan, he has seen many men and their cities, he becomes an\\nintimate and an adviser of the Haji, and he finds out evil passages in\\nMohammed Shafi\\'a\\'s life. Upon which Khudabakhsh ashamed, or rather\\nafraid of his duplicity, collects his Indian friends. The Hakim\\nAbdullah draws up a petition\\n</p><p>[p.49]addressed to Mr. Walne (H.B.M\\'s Consul) by the Indian merchants\\nand others resident at Cairo, informing him of Mohammed Shafi\\'a\\'s\\nbirth, character, and occupation as a vendor of slaves, offering proof\\nof all assertions, and praying him for the sake of their good name to\\ntake away his passport. And all the Indians affix their seals to this\\npaper. Then Mohammed Shafi\\'a threatens to waylay and to beat the Haji.\\nThe Haji, not loud or hectoringly, but with a composed smile, advises\\nhis friends to hold him off.\\n</p><p>One would suppose that such a document would have elicited some\\ninquiry.But Haji Wali was a Persian protege, and proceedings between\\nthe Consulates had commenced before the petition was presented. The\\npseudo-British subject, having been acknowledged as a real one, must be\\nsupported. Consuls, like kings, may err, but must not own to error. No\\nnotice was taken of the Indian petition; worse still, no inquiry into\\nthe slave-affair was set on foot[FN#7]; and it was discovered that the\\npassport having been granted by a Consul-General could not with\\nofficial etiquette be resumed by a Consul.[FN#8]\\n</p><p>[p.50]Thus matters were destined to proceed as they began. Mohammed\\nShafi\\'a had offered 5,000 piastres to the Persian Consul\\'s interpreter;\\nthis of course was refused, but still somehow or other all the Haji\\'s\\naffairs seemed to go wrong. His statements were mistranslated, his\\naccounts were misunderstood, and the suit was allowed to drag on to a\\nsuspicious length. When I left Cairo in July, Haji Wali had been kept\\naway nearly two months from his business and family, though both\\nparties-for the plaintiff\\'s purse was rapidly thinning-appeared eager\\nto settle the difference by arbitration: when I returned from Arabia in\\nOctober, matters were almost in statu quo ante, and when I started for\\nIndia in January, the proceedings had not closed.\\n</p><p>Such is a brief history, but too common, of a case in which the subject\\nof an Eastern state has to contend against British influence. It is\\ndoubtless a point of honour to defend our proteges from injustice, but\\nthe higher principle should rest upon the base of common honesty. The\\nworst part of such a case is, that the injured party has no redress.\\n</p><p>\"Fiat injustitia, ruat coelum,\"\\n</p><p>is the motto of his \"natural protectors,\" who would violate every law\\nto gratify the false pride of a petty English official. And, saving the\\nrare exceptions where rank or wealth command consideration, with what\\nface, to use the native phrase, would a hapless Turk appeal to the\\nhigher powers, our ministers or our Parliament?\\n</p><p>After lodging myself in the Wakalah, my first object was to make a\\ncertain stir in the world. In Europe your travelling doctor advertises\\nthe loss of a diamond ring, the gift of a Russian autocrat; or he\\nmonopolises a whole column in a newspaper, feeing perhaps a title for\\nthe use of a signature; the large brass plate, the gold-headed cane,\\nthe rattling chariot, and the summons from the sermon complete the\\nwork. Here, there is no such Royal\\n</p><p>[p.51]Road to medical fame. You must begin by sitting with the porter,\\nwho is sure to have blear eyes, into which you drop a little nitrate of\\nsilver, whilst you instil into his ear the pleasing intelligence that\\nyou never take a fee from the poor. He recovers; his report of you\\nspreads far and wide, crowding your doors with paupers. They come to\\nyou as though you were their servant, and when cured they turn their\\nbacks upon you for ever. Hence it is that European doctors generally\\ncomplain of ingratitude on the part of their Oriental patients. It is\\ntrue that if you save a man\\'s life, he naturally asks you for the means\\nof preserving it. Moreover, in none of the Eastern languages with which\\nI am acquainted is there a single term conveying the meaning of our\\n\"gratitude,\" and none but Germans[FN#9] have ideas unexplainable by\\nwords. But you must not condemn this absence of a virtue without\\nconsidering the cause. An Oriental deems that he has the right to your\\nsurplus. \"Daily bread is divided\" (by heaven), he asserts, and eating\\nyours, he considers it his own. Thus it is with other things. He is\\nthankful to Allah for the gifts of the Creator, but he has a claim to\\nthe good offices of a fellow-creature. In rendering him a service you\\nhave but done your duty, and he would not pay you so poor a compliment\\nas to praise you for the act. He leaves you, his benefactor, with a\\nshort prayer for the length of your days. \"Thank you,\" being expressed\\nby \"Allah increase thy weal!\" or the selfish wish that your shadow\\n(with which you protect him and his fellows) may never be less. And\\nthis is probably the last you hear of him.\\n</p><p>There is a discomfort in such proceedings, a reasonable,\\n</p><p>[p.52]a metaphysical coldness, uglily contrasting in theory with the\\ngenial warmth which a little more heart would infuse into them. In\\ntheory, I say, not in practice. Human nature feels kindness is\\ndisplayed to return it in kind. But Easterns do not carry out the idea\\nof such obligations as we do. What can be more troublesome than, when\\nyou have obliged a man, to run the gauntlet of his and his family\\'s\\nthanksgivings, to find yourself become a master from being a friend, a\\ngreat man when you were an equal; not to be contradicted, where shortly\\nbefore every one gave his opinion freely? You must be unamiable if\\nthese considerations deter you from benefiting your friend; yet, I\\nhumbly opine, you still may fear his gratefulness.\\n</p><p>To resume. When the mob has raised you to fame, patients of a better\\nclass will slowly appear on the scene. After some coquetting about\\n\"etiquette,\" whether you are to visit them, or they are to call upon\\nyou, they make up their minds to see you, and to judge with their eyes\\nwhether you are to be trusted or not; whilst you, on your side, set out\\nwith the determination that they shall at once cross the Rubicon,-in\\nless classical phrase, swallow your drug. If you visit the house, you\\ninsist upon the patient\\'s servants attending you; he must also provide\\nand pay an ass for your conveyance, no matter if it be only to the\\nother side of the street. Your confidential man accompanies you, primed\\nfor replies to the \"fifty searching questions\" of the \"servants\\' hall.\"\\nYou are lifted off the saddle tenderly, as nurses dismount their\\ncharges, when you arrive at the gate; and you waddle upstairs with\\ndignity. Arrived at the sick room, you salute those present with a\\ngeneral \"Peace be upon you!\" to which they respond, \"And upon thee be\\nthe peace and the mercy of Allah, and his blessing!\" To the invalid you\\nsay, \"There is nothing the matter, please Allah, except the health;\" to\\nwhich the proper answer-for here every\\n</p><p>[p.53]sign of ceremony has its countersign[FN#10]-is, \"May Allah give\\nthee health!\" Then you sit down, and acknowledge the presence of the\\ncompany by raising your right hand to your lips and forehead, bowing\\nthe while circularly; each individual returns the civility by a similar\\ngesture. Then inquiry about the state of your health ensues. Then you\\nare asked what refreshment you will take: you studiously mention\\nsomething not likely to be in the house, but at last you rough it with\\na pipe and a cup of coffee. Then you proceed to the patient, who\\nextends his wrist, and asks you what his complaint is. Then you examine\\nhis tongue, you feel his pulse, you look learned, and-he is talking all\\nthe time-after hearing a detailed list of all his ailments, you gravely\\ndiscover them, taking for the same as much praise to yourself as does\\nthe practising phrenologist for a similar simple exercise of the\\nreasoning faculties. The disease, to be respectable, must invariably be\\nconnected with one of the four temperaments, or the four elements, or\\nthe \"humours of Hippocrates.\" Cure is easy, but it will take time, and\\nyou, the doctor, require attention; any little rudeness it is in your\\npower to punish by an alteration in the pill, or the powder, and, so\\nunknown is professional honour, that none will brave your displeasure.\\nIf you would pass for a native practitioner, you must finally proceed\\nto the most uncomfortable part of your visit, bargaining for fees.\\nNothing more effectually arouses suspicion than disinterestedness in a\\ndoctor. I once cured a rich Hazramaut merchant of rheumatism, and\\nneglected to make him pay for treatment; he carried off one of my\\ncoffee cups, and was unceasingly wondering where I came from. So I made\\nhim produce five piastres, a shilling, which he threw upon the carpet,\\ncursing Indian avarice. \"You will bring on\\n</p><p>[p.54]another illness,\" said my friend, the Haji, when he heard of it.\\nProperly speaking, the fee for a visit to a respectable man is 20\\npiastres, but with the rich patient you begin by making a bargain. He\\ncomplains, for instance, of dysentery and sciatica. You demand L10 for\\nthe dysentery, and L20 for the sciatica. But you will rarely get it.\\nThe Eastern pays a doctor\\'s bill as an Oirishman does his \"rint,\"\\nmaking a grievance of it. Your patient will show indisputable signs of\\nconvalescence: he will laugh and jest half the day; but the moment you\\nappear, groans and a lengthened visage, and pretended complaints,\\nwelcome you. Then your way is to throw out some such hint as\\n</p><p>\"The world is a carcass, and they who seek it are dogs.\"\\n</p><p>And you refuse to treat the second disorder, which conduct may bring\\nthe refractory one to his senses. \"Dat Galenus opes,\" however, is a\\nWestern apothegm: the utmost \"Jalinus\" can do for you here is to\\nprovide you with the necessaries and comforts of life. Whatever you\\nprescribe must be solid and material, and if you accompany it with\\nsomething painful, such as rubbing to scarification with a horse-brush,\\nso much the better. Easterns, like our peasants in Europe, wish the\\ndoctor to \"give them the value of their money.\" Besides which, rough\\nmeasures act beneficially upon their imagination. So the Hakim of the\\nKing of Persia cured fevers by the bastinado; patients are beneficially\\nbaked in a bread-oven at Baghdad; and an Egyptian at Alexandria, whose\\nquartan resisted the strongest appliances of European physic, was\\neffectually healed by the actual cautery, which a certain Arab Shaykh\\napplied to the crown of his head. When you administer with your own\\nhand the remedy-half-a-dozen huge bread pills, dipped in a solution of\\naloes or cinnamon water, flavoured with assafoetida, which in the case\\nof the dyspeptic rich often suffice, if they will but\\n</p><p>[p.55]diet themselves-you are careful to say, \"In the name of Allah,\\nthe Compassionate, the Merciful.\" And after the patient has been dosed,\\n\"Praise be to Allah, the Curer, the Healer;\" you then call for pen,\\nink, and paper, and write some such prescription as this:\\n</p><p>\"A.[FN#11]\\n</p><p>\"In the name of Allah, the Compassionate, the Merciful, and blessings\\nand peace be upon our Lord the Apostle, and his family, and his\\ncompanions one and all! But afterwards let him take bees-honey and\\ncinnamon and album graecum, of each half a part, and of ginger a whole\\npart, which let him pound and mix with the honey, and form boluses,\\neach bolus the weight of a Miskal, and of it let him use every day a\\nMiskal on the saliva.[FN#12] Verily its effects are wonderful. And let\\nhim abstain from flesh, fish, vegetables, sweetmeats, flatulent food,\\nacids of all descriptions, as well as the major ablution, and live in\\nperfect quiet. So shall he be cured by the help of the King, the\\nHealer.[FN#13] And The Peace.[FN#14]\"\\n</p><p>The diet, I need scarcely say, should be rigorous; nothing has tended\\nmore to bring the European system of medicine into contempt among\\nOrientals than our inattention to this branch of the therapeutic art.\\nWhen an Hindi or a Hindu \"takes medicine,\" he prepares himself for it\\nby diet and rest two or three days before adhibition, and as gradually,\\nafter the dose, he relapses into his usual habits; if he break through\\nthe regime it is concluded that fatal results must ensue. The ancient\\nEgyptians we learn from Herodotus devoted a certain number of days in\\neach month to the use of alteratives, and the\\n</p><p>[p.56]period was consecutive, doubtless in order to graduate the\\nstrength of the medicine. The Persians, when under salivation, shut\\nthemselves up in a warm room, never undress, and so carefully guard\\nagainst cold that they even drink tepid water. When the Afghan princes\\nfind it necessary to employ Chob-Chini, (the Jin-seng,\\n[FN#15] or China\\n</p><p>[p.57]root so celebrated as a purifier, tonic, and aphrodisiac) they\\nchoose the spring season; they remove to a garden, where flowers and\\ntrees and bubbling streams soothe their senses; they carefully avoid\\nfatigue and trouble of all kinds, and will not even hear a letter read,\\nlest it should contain bad news.\\n</p><p>When the prescription is written out, you affix an impression of your\\nring seal to the beginning and to the end of it, that no one may be\\nable to add to or take from its contents. And when you send medicine to\\na patient of rank, who is sure to have enemies, you adopt some similar\\nprecaution against the box or the bottle being opened. One of the\\nPashas whom I attended,-a brave soldier who had been a favourite with\\nMohammed Ali, and therefore was degraded by his successor,-kept an\\nimpression of my ring in wax, to compare with that upon the phials. Men\\nhave not forgotten how frequently, in former times, those who became\\nobnoxious to the State were seized with sudden and fatal cramps in the\\nstomach. In the case of the doctor it is common prudence to adopt these\\nprecautions, as all evil consequences would be charged upon him, and he\\nwould be exposed to the family\\'s revenge.\\n</p><p>Cairo, though abounding in medical practitioners, can still support\\nmore; but to thrive they must be Indians, Chinese, or Maghrabis. The\\nEgyptians are thoroughly disgusted with European treatment, which is\\nhere about as efficacious as in India-that is to say, not at all. But\\nthey are ignorant of the medicine of Hind, and therefore great is its\\nname; deservedly perhaps, for skill in simples and dietetics. Besides\\nwhich the Indian\\n</p><p>[p.58]may deal in charms and spells,-things to which the latitude gives\\nsuch force that even Europeans learn to put faith in them. The\\ntraveller who, on the banks of the Seine, scoffs at Sights and Sounds,\\nTable-turning and Spirit-rapping, sees in the wilds of Tartary and\\nThibet a something supernatural and diabolical in the bungling Sie-fa\\nof the Bokte.[FN#16] Some sensible men, who pass for philosophers among\\ntheir friends, have been caught by the incantations of the turbanded\\nand bearded Cairo magician. In our West African colonies the phrase\\n\"growing black\" was applied to colonists, who, after a term of\\nresidence, became thoroughly imbued with the superstitions of the land.\\nAnd there are not wanting old Anglo-Indians, intelligent men, that\\nplace firm trust in tales and tenets too puerile even for the Hindus to\\nbelieve. As a \"Hindi\" I could use animal magnetism, taking care,\\nhowever, to give the science a specious supernatural appearance. Haji\\nWali, who, professing positive scepticism, showed the greatest interest\\nin the subject as a curiosity, advised me not to practise pure\\nmesmerism; otherwise, that I should infallibly become a \"Companion of\\nDevils.\" \"You must call this an Indian secret,\" said my friend, \"for it\\nis clear that you are no Mashaikh,[FN#17] and people will ask, where\\nare your drugs, and what business have you with charms?\" It is useless\\nto say that I followed his counsel; yet patients would consider\\nthemselves my\\n</p><p>[p.59]Murids (disciples), and delighted in kissing the hand of the\\nSahib Nafas[FN#18] or minor saint.\\n</p><p>The Haji repaid me for my docility by vaunting me everywhere as the\\nvery phoenix of physicians. My first successes were in the Wakalah;\\nopposite to me there lived an Arab slave dealer, whose Abyssinians\\nconstantly fell sick. A tender race, they suffer when first transported\\nto Egypt from many complaints, especially consumption, dysentery and\\nvaricose veins. I succeeded in curing one girl. As she was worth at\\nleast fifteen pounds, the gratitude of her owner was great, and I had\\nto dose half a dozen others in order to cure them of the pernicious and\\nprice-lowering habit of snoring. Living in rooms opposite these slave\\ngirls, and seeing them at all hours of the day and night, I had\\nfrequent opportunities of studying them. They were average specimens of\\nthe steato-pygous Abyssinian breed, broad-shouldered, thin-flanked,\\nfine-limbed, and with haunches of a prodigious size. None of them had\\nhandsome features, but the short curly hair that stands on end being\\nconcealed under a kerchief, there was something pretty in the brow,\\neyes, and upper part of the nose, coarse and sensual in the pendent\\nlips, large jowl and projecting mouth, whilst the whole had a\\ncombination of piquancy with sweetness. Their style of flirtation was\\npeculiar.\\n</p><p>\"How beautiful thou art, O Maryam!-what eyes!-what-\"\\n</p><p>[p.60]\"Then why,\"-would respond the lady-\"don\\'t you buy me?\"\\n</p><p>\"We are of one faith-of one creed-formed to form each other\\'s\\nhappiness.\"\\n</p><p>\"Then why don\\'t you buy me?\"\\n</p><p>\"Conceive, O Maryam, the blessing of two hearts-\"\\n</p><p>\"Then why don\\'t you buy me?\"\\n</p><p>and so on. Most effectual gag to Cupid\\'s eloquence! Yet was not the\\nplain-spoken Maryam\\'s reply without its moral. How often is it our\\nfate, in the West as in the East, to see in bright eyes and to hear\\nfrom rosy lips an implied, if not an expressed, \"Why don\\'t you buy me?\"\\nor, worse still, \"Why can\\'t you buy me?\"\\n</p><p>All I required in return for my services from the slave-dealer, whose\\nbrutal countenance and manners were truly repugnant, was to take me\\nabout the town, and explain to me certain mysteries in his craft, which\\nknowledge might be useful in time to come. Little did he suspect who\\nhis interrogator was, and freely in his unsuspiciousness he entered\\nupon the subject of slave hunting in the Somali country, and Zanzibar,\\nof all things the most interesting to me. I have, however, nothing new\\nto report concerning the present state of bondsmen in Egypt. England\\nhas already learned that slaves are not necessarily the most wretched\\nand degraded of men. Some have been bold enough to tell the British\\npublic that, in the generality of Oriental countries,[FN#19] the serf\\nfares far\\n</p><p>[p.61]better than the servant, or indeed than the poorer orders of\\nfreemen. \"The laws of Mahomet enjoin his followers to treat slaves with\\nthe greatest mildness, and the Moslems are in general scrupulous\\nobservers of the Apostle\\'s recommendation. Slaves are considered\\nmembers of the family, and in houses where free servants are also kept,\\nthey seldom do any other work than filling the pipes, presenting the\\ncoffee, accompanying their master when going out, rubbing his feet when\\nhe takes his nap in the afternoon, and driving away the flies from him.\\nWhen a slave is not satisfied, he can legally compel his master to sell\\nhim. He has no care for food, lodging, clothes and washing, and has no\\ntaxes to pay; he is exempt from military service and soccage, and in\\nspite of his bondage is freer than the freest Fellah in Egypt.[FN#20]\"\\nThis is, I believe, a true statement, but of course it in no wise\\naffects the question of slavery in the abstract. A certain amount of\\nreputation was the consequence of curing the Abyssinian girls: my\\nfriend Haji Wali carefully told the news to all the town, and before\\nfifteen days were over, I found myself obliged to decline extending a\\npractice which threatened me with fame.\\n</p><p>Servants are most troublesome things to all Englishmen in Egypt, but\\nespecially to one travelling as a respectable native, and therefore\\nexpected to have slaves. After much deliberation, I resolved to take a\\nBerberi,[FN#21]\\n</p><p>[p.62]and accordingly summoned a Shaykh-there is a Shaykh for\\neverything down to thieves in \"the East,\" (in Egypt since the days of\\nDiodorus Siculus), and made known my want. The list of sine qua nons\\nwas necessarily rather an extensive one,-good health and a readiness to\\ntravel anywhere, a little skill in cooking, sewing and washing,\\nwillingness to fight, and a habit of regular prayers. After a day\\'s\\ndelay the Shaykh brought me a specimen of his choosing, a\\nbroad-shouldered, bandy-legged fellow, with the usual bull-dog\\nexpression of the Berberis, in his case rendered doubly expressive by\\nthe drooping of an eyelid-an accident brought about with acrid juice in\\norder to avoid conscription. He responded sturdily to all my questions.\\nSome Egyptian donkey boys and men were making a noise in the room at\\nthe time, and the calm ferocity with which he ejected them commanded my\\napproval. When a needle, thread, and an unhemmed napkin were handed to\\nhim, he sat down, held the edge of the cloth between his big toe and\\nits neighbour, and finished the work in quite a superior style. Walking\\nout, he armed himself with a Kurbaj, which he used, now lightly, then\\nheavily, upon all laden animals, biped and quadruped, that came in the\\nway. His conduct proving equally satisfactory in the kitchen, after\\ngetting security from him, and having his name registered by the\\nShaykh,[FN#22] I closed with him for eighty piastres a\\n</p><p>[p.63]month. But Ali the Berberi and I were destined to part. Before a\\nfortnight he stabbed his fellow servant-a Surat lad, who wishing to\\nreturn home forced his services upon me-and for this trick he received,\\nwith his dismissal, 400 blows on the feet by order of the Zabit, or\\npolice magistrate. After this failure I tried a number of servants,\\nEgyptians, Sa\\'idis,[FN#23] and clean and unclean eating[FN#24]\\nBerberis. Recommended by different Shaykhs, all had some fatal defect;\\none cheated recklessly, another robbed me, a third drank, a fourth was\\nalways in scrapes for infringing the Julian edict, and the last, a\\nlong-legged Nubian, after remaining two days in the house, dismissed me\\nfor expressing\\n</p><p>[p.64]a determination to travel by sea from Suez to Yambu\\'. I kept one\\nman; he complained that he was worked to death: two-they did nothing\\nbut fight; and three-they left me, as Mr. Elwes said of old, to serve\\nmyself. At last, thoroughly tired of Egyptian domestics, and one\\nservant being really sufficient for comfort, as well as suitable to my\\nassumed rank, I determined to keep only the Indian boy. He had all the\\ndefects of his nation; a brave at Cairo, he was an arrant coward at\\nAl-Madinah; the Badawin despised him heartily for his effeminacy in\\nmaking his camel kneel to dismount, and he could not keep his hands\\nfrom picking and stealing. But the choice had its advantages: his\\nswarthy skin and chubby features made the Arabs always call him an\\nAbyssinian slave, which, as it favoured my disguise, I did not care to\\ncontradict; he served well, he was amenable to discipline, and being\\ncompletely dependent upon me, he was therefore less likely to watch and\\nespecially to prate about my proceedings. As master and man we\\nperformed the pilgrimage together; but, on my return to Egypt after the\\npilgrimage, Shaykh (become Haji) Nur, finding me to be a Sahib,[FN#25]\\nchanged for the worse. He would not work, and reserved all his energy\\nfor the purpose of pilfering, which he practised so audaciously upon my\\nfriends, as well as upon myself, that he could not be kept in the house.\\n</p><p>Perhaps the reader may be curious to see the necessary expenses of a\\nbachelor residing at Cairo. He must observe, however, in the following\\nlist that I was not a strict economist, and, besides that, I was a\\nstranger in the country: inhabitants and old settlers would live as\\nwell for little more than two-thirds the sum.\\n</p>\\n<center><a href=\"/wiki/File:Burton_Bachelor.PNG\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Burton Bachelor.PNG\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/57/Burton_Bachelor.PNG/450px-Burton_Bachelor.PNG\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"450\" height=\"391\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/57/Burton_Bachelor.PNG 1.5x\" data-file-width=\"579\" data-file-height=\"503\" /></a></center>\\n<p>In these days who at Cairo without a Shaykh? I thought it right\\nto conform to popular custom, and accordingly, after having secured a\\nservant, my efforts were directed to finding a teacher; the pretext\\nbeing that as an Indian doctor I wanted to read Arabic works on\\nmedicine, as well as to perfect myself in divinity and\\npronunciation.[FN#26] My theological studies were in the Shafe\\'i school\\nfor two reasons: in the first place, it is the least rigorous of the\\nFour Orthodox, and, secondly, it most resembles the Shi\\'ah heresy, with\\nwhich long intercourse\\n</p><p>[p.67]with Persians had made me familiar.[FN#27] My choice of doctrine,\\nhowever, confirmed those around me in their conviction that I was a\\nrank heretic, for the \\'Ajami, taught by his religion to conceal\\noffensive tenets[FN#28] in lands where the open expression would be\\ndangerous, always represents himself to be a Shafe\\'i. This, together\\nwith the original mistake of appearing publicly at Alexandria as a\\n\"Mirza\" in a Persian dress, caused me infinite small annoyance at\\nCairo, in spite of all precautions and contrivances. And throughout my\\njourney, even in Arabia, though I drew my knife every time an offensive\\nhint was thrown out, the ill-fame clung to me like the shirt of Nessus.\\n</p><p>It was not long before I happened to hit upon a proper teacher, in the\\nperson of Shaykh Mohammed al-Attar, or the \"Druggist.\" He had known\\nprosperity, having once been a Khatib (preacher) in one of Mohammed\\nAli\\'s mosques. But His Highness the late Pasha had dismissed him, which\\ndisastrous event, with its subsequent train of misfortunes, he dates\\nfrom the melancholy day when he took to himself a wife. He talks of her\\nabroad as a stern and rigid master dealing with a naughty slave,\\nthough, by the look that accompanies his rhodomontade, I am convinced\\nthat at home he is the very model of \"managed men.\" His dismissal was\\nthe reason that compelled him to fall back upon the trade of a\\ndruggist, the refuge for the once wealthy, though now destitute, Sages\\nof Egypt.\\n</p><p>His little shop in the Jamaliyah Quarter is a perfect gem of Nilotic\\nqueerness. A hole, about five feet long\\n</p><p>[p.68]and six deep, pierced in the wall of some house, it is divided\\ninto two compartments separated by a thin partition of wood, and\\ncommunicating by a kind of arch cut in the boards. The inner box, germ\\nof a back parlour, acts as store-room, as the pile of empty old baskets\\ntossed in dusty confusion upon the dirty floor shows. In the front is\\ndisplayed the stock in trade, a matting full of Persian tobacco and\\npipe-bowls of red clay, a palm-leaf bag containing vile coffee and\\nlarge lumps of coarse, whity-brown sugar wrapped up in browner paper.\\nOn the shelves and ledges are rows of well-thumbed wooden boxes,\\nlabelled with the greatest carelessness, pepper for rhubarb, arsenic\\nfor Tafl, or wash-clay, and sulphate of iron where sal-ammoniac should\\nbe. There is also a square case containing, under lock and key, small\\nchange and some choice articles of commerce, damaged perfumes, bad\\nantimony for the eyes, and pernicious rouge. And dangling close above\\nit is a rusty pair of scales, ill poised enough for Egyptian Themis\\nherself to use. To hooks over the shop-front are suspended reeds for\\npipes, tallow candles, dirty wax tapers and cigarette paper; instead of\\nplate-glass windows and brass-handled doors, a ragged net keeps away\\nthe flies when the master is in, and the thieves when he goes out to\\nrecite in the Hasanayn Mosque his daily chapter \"Ya Sin.[FN#29]\" A\\nwooden shutter which closes down at night-time, and by day two\\npalm-stick stools intensely dirty and full of fleas, occupying the\\nplace of the Mastabah or earthen bench,[FN#30] which accommodated\\npurchasers, complete the furniture of my preceptor\\'s establishment.\\n</p><p>[p.69]There he sits, or rather lies (for verily I believe he sleeps\\nthrough three-fourths of the day), a thin old man about\\nfifty-eight,[FN#31] with features once handsome and regular; a sallow\\nface, shaven head, deeply wrinkled cheeks, eyes hopelessly bleared, and\\na rough grey beard ignorant of oil and comb. His turband, though large,\\nis brown with wear; his coat and small-clothes display many a hole;\\nand, though his face and hands must be frequently washed preparatory to\\ndevotion, still they have the quality of looking always unclean. It is\\nwonderful how fierce and gruff he is to the little boys and girls who\\nflock to him grasping farthings for pepper and sugar. On such occasions\\nI sit admiring to see him, when forced to exertion, wheel about on his\\nplace, making a pivot of that portion of our organisation which mainly\\ndistinguishes our species from the other families of the Simiadae, to\\nreach some distant drawer, or to pull down a case from its accustomed\\nshelf. How does he manage to say his prayers, to kneel and to prostrate\\nhimself upon that two feet of ragged rug, scarcely sufficient for a\\nBritish infant to lie upon? He hopelessly owns that he knows nothing of\\nhis craft, and the seats before his shop are seldom occupied. His great\\npleasure appears to be when the Haji and I sit by him a few minutes in\\nthe evening, bringing with us pipes, which he assists us to smoke, and\\nordering coffee, which he insists upon sweetening with a lump of sugar\\nfrom his little store. There we make him talk and laugh, and\\noccasionally quote a few lines strongly savouring of the jovial: we\\nprovoke him to long stories about the love borne him in his\\nstudent-days by the great and holy Shaykh Abd al-Rahman, and the\\nantipathy with which he was regarded by the equally\\n</p><p>[p.70]great and holy Shakh Nasr al-Din, his memorable single\\nimprisonment for contumacy,[FN#32] and the temperate but effective\\nlecture, beginning with \"O almost entirely destitute of shame!\"\\ndelivered on that occasion in presence of other under-graduates by the\\nRight Reverend principal of his college. Then we consult him upon\\nmatters of doctrine, and quiz him tenderly about his powers of\\ndormition, and flatter him, or rather his age, with such phrases as,\\n\"The water from thy hand is of the Waters of Zemzem;\" or, \"We have\\nsought thee to deserve the Blessings of the Wise upon our\\nundertakings.\" Sometimes, with interested motives it must be owned, we\\ninduce him to accompany us to the Hammam,[FN#33] where he insists upon\\npaying the smallest sum, quarrelling with everything and\\n</p><p>[p.71]everybody, and giving the greatest trouble. We are generally his\\nonly visitors; acquaintances he appears to have few, and no friends; he\\nmust have had them once, for he was rich, but is not so now, so they\\nhave fallen away from the poor old man.\\n</p><p>When the Shaykh Mohammed sits with me, or I climb up into his little\\nshop for the purpose of receiving a lesson from him, he is quite at his\\nease, reading when he likes, or making me read, and generally beginning\\neach lecture with some such preamble as this[FN#34]:-\\n</p><p>\"Aywa! aywa! aywa![FN#35]\"-Even so, even so, even so! we take refuge\\nwith Allah from Satan the Stoned! In the name of Allah, the\\nCompassionate, the Merciful, and the Blessings of Allah upon our Lord\\nMohammed, and his Family and his Companions one and all!

Even the Siberians, we are\\ntold, intoxicate themselves by the vapour of this seed thrown upon\\nred-hot stones. Egypt surpasses all other nations in the variety of\\ncompounds into which this fascinating drug enters, and will one day\\nprobably supply the Western world with \"Indian hemp,\" when its solid\\nmerits are duly appreciated.

It is an honourable\\nterm in Arabia, where \"Khurasani\" (a native of Khorasan), leads men to\\nsuspect a Persian, and the other generic appellation of the Afghan\\ntribes \"Sulaymani,\" a descendant from Solomon, reminds the people of\\ntheir proverb, \"Sulaymani harami!\"-\"the Afghans are ruffians!\"\\n[FN#5] For the simple reason that no Eastern power confers such an\\nobligation except for value received. In old times, when official\\nhonour was not so rigorous as it is now, the creditors of Eastern\\npowers and principalities would present high sums to British Residents\\nand others for the privilege of being enrolled in the list of their\\nsubjects or servants. This they made profitable; for their claims,\\nhowever exorbitant, when backed by a name of fear, were certain to be\\nadmitted, unless the Resident\\'s conscience would allow of his being\\npersuaded by weightier arguments of a similar nature to abandon his\\nprotege. It is almost needless to remark that nothing of the kind can\\noccur in the present day, and at the same time that throughout the\\nEastern world it is firmly believed that such things are of daily\\noccurrence. Ill fame descends to distant generations; whilst good\\ndeeds, if they blossom, as we are told, in the dust, are at least as\\nshort-lived as they are sweet.\\n[FN#6] A doctor, a learned man; not to be confounded with Hakim, a\\nruler.\\n[FN#7] It may be as well to remark that our slave laws require reform\\nthroughout the East, their severity, like Draco\\'s Code, defeating their\\npurpose. In Egypt, for instance, they require modification. Constitute\\nthe offence a misdemeanour, not a felony, inflict a fine (say L100),\\nhalf of which should be given to the informer, and make the\\nimprisonment either a short one, or, what would be better still, let it\\nbe done away with, except in cases of non-payment; and finally, let the\\nConsul or some other magistrate residing at the place have power to\\ninflict the penalty of the law, instead of being obliged, as at\\npresent, to transmit offenders to Malta for trial. As the law now\\nstands, our officials are unwilling to carry its rigours into effect;\\nthey therefore easily lend an ear to the standard excuse-ignorance-in\\norder to have an opportunity of decently dismissing a man, with a\\nwarning not to do it again.\\n[FN#8] Yet at the time there was at Alexandria an acting\\nConsul-General, to whom the case could with strict propriety have been\\nreferred.\\n[FN#9] Johann Gottlieb Fichte expressly declares that the scope of his\\nsystem has never been explained by words, and that it even admits not\\nof being so explained. To make his opinions intelligible, he would\\nexpress them by a system of figures, each of which must have a known\\nand positive value.\\n[FN#10] M. C. de Perceval (Arabic Grammar), and Lane (Mod. Egyptians,\\nChapter 8 et passim), give specimens.\\n[FN#11] A monogram generally placed at the head of writings.

Huc we learn that Jin-seng is the most considerable\\narticle of Manchurian commerce, and that throughout China there is no\\nchemist\\'s shop unprovided with more or less of it. He adds: \"The\\nChinese report marvels of the Jin-seng, and no doubt it is for Chinese\\norganisation a tonic of very great effect for old and weak persons; but\\nits nature is too heating, the Chinese physicians admit, for the\\nEuropean temperament, already in their opinion too hot. The price is\\nenormous, and doubtless its dearness contributes with a people like the\\nChinese to raise its celebrity so high. The rich and the Mandarins\\nprobably use it only because it is above the reach of other people, and\\nout of pure ostentation.\" It is the principal tonic used throughout\\nCentral Asia, and was well known in Europe when Sarsaparilla arose to\\ndispute with it the palm of popularity. In India, Persia, and\\nAfghanistan, it is called chob-chini,-the \"Chinese wood.\" The\\npreparations are in two forms, 1. Sufuf, or powder; 2. Kahwah, or\\ndecoction. The former is compound of Radix China Qrient, with gum\\nmastich and sugar-candy, equal parts; about a dram of this compound is\\ntaken once a day, early in the morning. For the decoction one ounce of\\nfine parings is boiled for a quarter of an hour in a quart of water.\\nWhen the liquid assumes a red colour it is taken off the fire and left\\nto cool. Furthermore, there are two methods of adhibiting the\\nchoh-chini: 1. Band; 2. Khola. The first is when the patient confines\\nhimself to a garden, listening to music, enjoying the breeze, the song\\nof birds, and the bubbling of a flowing stream. He avoids everything\\nlikely to trouble and annoy him; he will not even open a letter, and\\nthe doctor forbids anyone to contradict him. Some grandees in central\\nAsia will go through a course of forty days in every second year; it\\nreminds one of Epicurus\\' style of treatment,-the downy bed, the\\ngarlands of flowers, the good wine, and the beautiful singing girl, and\\nis doubtless at least as efficacious in curing as the sweet relaxation\\nof Gr\\xef\\xbf\\xbdfenberg or Malvern. So says Socrates, according to the Anatomist\\nof Melancholy,\\n\"Oculum non curabis sine toto capite,\\nNec caput sine toto corpore,\\nNec totum corpus sine animo.\"\\nThe \"Khola\" signifies that you take the tonic without other precautions\\nthan the avoiding acids, salt, and pepper, and choosing summer time, as\\ncold is supposed to induce rheumatism.\\n[FN#16] Certain Lamas who, we learn from M. Huc, perform famous Sie-fa,\\nor supernaturalisms, such as cutting open the abdomen, licking red-hot\\nirons, making incisions in various parts of the body, which an instant\\nafterwards leave no trace behind, &amp;c., &amp;c. The devil may \"have a great\\ndeal to do with the matter\" in Tartary, for all I know; but I can\\nassure M. Huc, that the Rufa\\'i Darwayshes in India and the Sa\\'adiyah at\\nCairo perform exactly the same feats. Their jugglery, seen through the\\nsmoke of incense, and amidst the enthusiasm of a crowd, is tolerably\\ndexterous, and no more.\\n[FN#17] A holy man. The word has a singular signification in a plural\\nform, \"honoris causa.\"\\n[FN#18] A title literally meaning the \"Master of Breath,\" one who can\\ncure ailments, physical as well as spiritual, by breathing upon them-a\\npractice well known to mesmerists. The reader will allow me to observe,\\n(in self-defence, otherwise he might look suspiciously upon so\\ncredulous a narrator), that when speaking of animal magnetism, as a\\nthing established, I allude to the lower phenomena, rejecting the\\ndiscussion of all disputed points, as the existence of a magnetic Aura,\\nand of all its unintelligibilities-Prevision, Levitation, Introvision,\\nand other divisions of Clairvoyance.\\n[FN#19] In the generality, not in all. Nothing, for instance, can be\\nmore disgraceful to human nature than the state of praedial slavery, or\\nserfs attached to the glebe, when Malabar was under the dominion of the\\n\"mild Hindu.\" And as a rule in the East it is only the domestic slaves\\nwho taste the sweets of slavery. Yet there is truth in Sonnini\\'s\\nterrible remark: \"The severe treatment under which the slaves languish\\nin the West Indies is the shameful prerogative of civilisation, and is\\nunknown to those nations among whom barbarism is reported to hold\\nsway.\" (Travels in Upper and Lower Egypt, vol. ii.)\\n[FN#20] The author has forgotten to mention one of the principal\\nadvantages of slaves, namely, the prospect of arriving at the highest\\nrank of the empire. The Pasha of the Syrian caravan with which I\\ntravelled to Damascus, had been the slave of a slave, and he is but a\\nsolitary instance of cases perpetually occuring in all Moslem lands.\\n\"C\\'est un homme de bonne famille,\" said a Turkish officer in Egypt, \"il\\na ete achete.\"\\n[FN#21] A \"Barbarian\" from Nubia and Upper Egypt. Some authorities, Mr.\\nLane for instance, attribute the good reputation of these people to\\ntheir superior cunning. Sonnini says, \"they are intelligent and handy\\nservants, but knaves.\" Others believe in them. As far as I could find\\nout, they were generally esteemed more honest than the Egyptians, and\\nthey certainly possess a certain sense of honour unknown to their\\nnorthern brethren. \"Berberi\" is a term of respect; \"Masri\" (corrupted\\nfrom Misri) in the mouth of a Badawi or an Arab of Arabia is a\\nreproach. \"He shall be called an Egyptian,\" means \"he shall belong to a\\ndegraded race.\"\\n[FN#22] Who becomes responsible, and must pay for any theft his protege\\nmay commit. Berberis, being generally \"les Suisses\" of respectable\\nestablishments, are expected to be honest. But I can assert from\\nexperience that, as a native, you will never recover the value of a\\nstolen article without having recourse to the police. For his valuable\\nsecurity, the Shaykh demands a small fee (7 or 8 piastres), which,\\ndespite the urgent remonstrances of protector and protege, you deduct\\nfrom the latter\\'s wages. The question of pay is a momentous one; too\\nmuch always spoils a good servant, too little leaves you without one.\\nAn Egyptian of the middle class would pay his Berberi about 40 piastres\\na month, besides board, lodging, some small perquisites, and presents\\non certain occasions. This, however, will not induce a man to travel,\\nespecially to cross the sea.\\n[FN#23] A man from the Sa\\'id or Upper Egypt.\\n[FN#24] A favourite way of annoying the Berberis is to repeat the\\nsaying, \"we have eaten the clean, we have eaten the unclean,\"-meaning,\\nthat they are by no means cunning in the difference between right and\\nwrong, pure and impure. I will relate the origin of the saying, as I\\nheard it differently, from Mansfield Parkyns, (Life in Abyssinia, chap.\\n31.) A Berberi, said my informant, had been carefully fattening a fine\\nsheep for a feast, when his cottage was burned by an accident. In the\\nashes he found roasted meat, which looked tempting to a hungry man: he\\ncalled his neighbours, and all sat down to make merry over the mishap;\\npresently they came to the head, which proved to be that of a dog, some\\nenemy having doubtless stolen the sheep and put the impure animal in\\nits place. Whereupon, sadly perplexed, all the Berberis went to their\\npriest, and dolefully related the circumstance, expecting absolution,\\nas the offence was involuntary. \"You have eaten filth,\" said the man of\\nAllah. \"Well,\" replied the Berberis, falling upon him with their fists,\\n\"filth or not, we have eaten it.\" The Berberi, I must remark, is the\\n\"Paddy\" of this part of the world, celebrated for bulls and blunders.\\n[FN#25] The generic name given by Indians to English officials.\\n[FN#26] There are four kinds of tobacco smoked in Egypt. The first and\\nbest is the well-known Latakia, generally called \"Jabali,\" either from\\na small seaport town about three hours\\' journey south of Latakia, or\\nmore probably because grown on the hills near the ancient Laodicea.\\nPure, it is known by its blackish colour, fine shredding, absence of\\nstalk, and an undescribable odour, to me resembling that of creosote;\\nthe leaf, too, is small, so that when made into cigars it must be\\ncovered over with a slip of the yellow Turkish tobacco called Bafra.\\nExcept at the highest houses unadulterated Latakia is not to be had in\\nCairo. Yet, mixed as it is, no other growth exceeds it in flavour and\\nfragrance. Miss Martineau smoked it, we are told, without\\ninconvenience, and it differs from our Shag, Bird\\'s-eye, and Returns,\\nin degree, as does Chateau Margeau from a bottle of cheap strong\\nSpanish wine. To bring out its flavour, the connoisseur smokes it in\\nlong pipes of cherry, jasmine, maple, or rosewood, and these require a\\nservant skilled in the arts of cleaning and filling them. The best\\nJabali at Cairo costs about seven piastres the pound; after which a\\nsmall sum must be paid to the Farram or chopper, who prepares it for\\nuse.\\n2nd. Suri (Tyrian), or Shami, or Suryani, grown in Syria, an inferior\\ngrowth, of a lighter colour than Latakia, and with a greenish tinge;\\nwhen cut, its value is about three piastres per pound. Some smokers mix\\nthis leaf with Jabali, which, to my taste, spoils the flavour of the\\nlatter without improving the former. The strongest kind, called Korani\\nor Jabayl, is generally used for cigarettes; it costs, when of\\nfirst-rate quality, about five piastres per pound.\\n3rd. Tumbak, or Persian tobacco, called Hijazi, because imported from\\nthe Hijaz, where everybody smokes it, and supposed to come from Shiraz,\\nKazerun, and other celebrated places in Persia. It is all but\\nimpossible to buy this article unadulterated, except from the caravans\\nreturning after the pilgrimage. The Egyptians mix it with native\\ngrowths, which ruins its flavour and gives it an acridity that \"catches\\nthe throat,\" whereas good tumbak never yet made a man cough. Yet the\\ntaste of this tobacco, even when second-rate, is so fascinating to some\\nsmokers that they will use no other. To be used it should be wetted and\\nsqueezed, and it is invariably inhaled through water into the lungs:\\nalmost every town has its favourite description of pipe, and these are\\nof all kinds, from the pauper\\'s rough cocoa-nut mounted with two reeds,\\nto the prince\\'s golden bowl set with the finest stones. Tumbak is\\ncheap, costing about four piastres a pound, but large quantities of it\\nare used.\\n4th. Hummi, as the word signifies, a \"hot\" variety of the tumbak, grown\\nin Al-Yaman and other countries. It is placed in the tile on the buri\\nor cocoa-nut pipe, unwetted, and has a very acrid flavour. Being\\nsupposed to produce intoxication, or rather a swimming in the head,\\nhummi gives its votaries a bad name: respectable men would answer \"no\"\\nwith rage if asked whether they are smoking it, and when a fellow tells\\nyou that he has seen better days, but that now he smokes Hummi in a\\nburi, you understand him that his misfortunes have affected either his\\nbrain or his morality. Hence it is that this tobacco is never put into\\npipes intended for smoking the other kinds. The price of Hummi is about\\nfive piastres per pound.\\n[FN#26] A study essential to the learned, as in some particular\\nportions of the Koran a mispronunciation becomes a sin.\\n[FN#27] The Shafe\\'i, to quote but one point of similarity, abuse Yazid,\\nthe Syrian tyrant, who caused the death of the Imam Husayn: this\\nexpression of indignation is forbidden by the Hanafi doctors, who\\nrigidly order their disciples to \"judge not.\"\\n[FN#28] A systematic concealment of doctrine, and profession of popular\\ntenets, technically called by the Shi\\'ahs \"Takiyah:\" the literal\\nmeaning of the word is \"fear,\" or \"caution.\"\\n[FN#29] One of the most esteemed chapters of the Koran, frequently\\nrecited as a Wazifah or daily task by religious Moslems in Egypt.\\n[FN#30] The Mastabah here is a long earthen bench plastered over with\\nclay, and raised about two feet from the ground, so as to bring the\\npurchaser\\'s head to a level with the shop. Mohammed Ali ordered the\\npeople to remove them, as they narrowed the streets; their place is now\\nsupplied by \"Kafas,\" cages or stools of wicker-work.\\n[FN#31] A great age in Lower Egypt, where but few reach the 12th\\nlustre. Even the ancients observed that the old Egyptians, despite\\ntheir attention to diet and physic, were the most short-lived, and the\\nBritons, despite their barbarism, the longest lived of men.\\n[FN#32] This is the \"imposition\" of Oxford and Cambridge.\\n[FN#33] The Hammam, or hot bath, being a kind of religious\\nestablishment, is one of the class of things-so uncomfortably numerous\\nin Eastern countries-left \\'ala jud\\'ak, \"to thy generosity.\"\\nConsequently, you are pretty sure to have something disagreeable there,\\nwhich you would vainly attempt to avoid by liberality. The best way to\\ndeal with all such extortioners, with the Lawingi (undresser) of a\\nCairo Hammam, or the \"jarvey\" of a London Hansom, is to find out the\\nfare, and never to go beyond it-never to be generous. The Hammam has\\nbeen too often noticed to bear another description: one point, however,\\nconnected with it I must be allowed to notice. Mr. Lane (Modern\\nEgyptians) asserts that a Moslem should not pray nor recite the Koran\\nin it, as the bath is believed to be a favourite resort of Jinnis (or\\ngenii). On the contrary, it is the custom of some sects to recite a\\nRuk\\'atayn (two-bow) prayer immediately after religious ablution in the\\nhot cistern. This, however, is makruh, or improper without being\\nsinful, to the followers of Abu Hanifah. As a general rule, throughout\\nAl-Islam, the Farz (obligatory) prayers may be recited everywhere, no\\nmatter how impure the place may be: but those belonging to the classes\\nsunnat (traditionary) and nafilah (supererogatory) are makruh, though\\nnot actually unlawful, in certain localities. I venture this remark on\\naccount of the extreme accuracy of the work referred to. A wonderful\\ncontrast to the generality of Oriental books, it amply deserves a\\nrevision in the rare places requiring care.\\n[FN#34] Europeans so seldom see the regular old Shaykh, whose place is\\nnow taken by polite young men educated in England or France, that this\\nscene may be new even to those who have studied of late years on the\\nbanks of the Nile.\\n[FN#35] This word is often used to signify simply \"yes.\" It is\\ncorrupted from Ay wa\\'llahi, \"Yes, by Allah.\" In pure Arabic \"ay\" or \"I\"\\nis synonymous with our \"yes\" or \"ay\"; and \"Allah\" in those countries\\nenters somehow into every other phrase.\\n[FN#36] This is, of course, ironical: \"Allah be praised for creating\\nsuch a prodigy of learning as thou art!\"\\n[FN#37] The larger the turband the greater are the individual\\'s\\npretensions to religious knowledge and respectability of demeanour.\\nThis is the custom in Egypt, Turkey, Persia, and many other parts of\\nthe Moslem world.\\n[FN#38] Ya gad\\'a, as the Egyptians pronounce it, is used exactly like\\nthe \"mon brave\" of France, and our \"my good man.\"\\n[FN#39] The \"mountain\" in Egypt and Arabia is what the \"jungle\" is in\\nIndia. When informed that \"you come from the mountain,\" you understand\\nthat you are considered a mere clodhopper: when asserting that you will\\n\"sit upon the mountain,\" you hint to your hearers an intention of\\nturning anchorite or magician.\\n[FN#40] Ya hu, a common interpellative, not, perhaps, of the politest\\ndescription.\\n[FN#41] A religious formula used when compelled to mention anything\\nabominable or polluting to the lips of a pious man.\\n</p>\\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Chapter_V._THE_RAMAZAN.\">Chapter V.

For the\\nspace of sixteen consecutive hours and a quarter, we were forbidden to\\neat, drink, smoke, snuff, and even to swallow our saliva designedly. I\\nsay forbidden, for although the highest orders of Turks,-the class is\\npopularly described as\\n</p><p>\"Turco fino\\nMangia porco e beve vino.\"-\\n</p><p>may break the ordinance in strict privacy, popular opinion would\\ncondemn any open infraction of it with uncommon severity.

And among the vulgar, sinners who habitually drink when they\\nshould pray, will fast and perform their devotions through the Ramazan.\\n</p><p>Like the Italian, the Anglo-Catholic, and the Greek fasts, the chief\\neffect of the \"blessed month\" upon True Believers is to darken their\\ntempers into positive gloom.\\n</p><p>[p.75]Their voices, never of the softest, acquire, especially after\\nnoon, a terribly harsh and creaking tone. The men curse one\\nanother[FN#1] and beat the women. The women slap and abuse the\\nchildren, and these in their turn cruelly entreat, and use bad language\\nto, the dogs and cats. You can scarcely spend ten minutes in any\\npopulous part of the city without hearing some violent dispute. The\\n\"Karakun,\" or station-houses, are filled with lords who have\\nadministered an undue dose of chastisement to their ladies, and with\\nladies who have scratched, bitten, and otherwise injured the bodies of\\ntheir lords. The Mosques are crowded with a sulky, grumbling\\npopulation, making themselves offensive to one another on earth whilst\\nworking their way to heaven; and in the shade, under the outer walls,\\nthe little boys who have been expelled the church attempt to forget\\ntheir miseries in spiritless play. In the bazars and streets, pale\\nlong-drawn faces, looking for the most part intolerably cross, catch\\nyour eye, and at this season a stranger will sometimes meet with\\npositive incivility. A shopkeeper, for instance, usually says when he\\nrejects an insufficient offer, \"Yaftah Allah,\"-\"Allah opens.[FN#2]\"\\nDuring the Ramazan, he will grumble about the bore of Ghashim, or\\n\"Johnny raws,\" and gruffly tell you not to stand there wasting his\\ntime. But as a rule the shops are either shut or destitute of shopmen,\\nmerchants will not purchase, and students will not study. In fine,\\n</p><p>[p.76]the Ramazan, for many classes, is one-twelfth of the year\\nwantonly thrown away.\\n</p><p>The following is the routine of a fast day. About half an hour after\\nmidnight, the gun sounds its warning to faithful men that it is time to\\nprepare for the \"Sahur,\" (early breakfast) or morning meal. My servant\\nthen wakes me, if I have slept; brings water for ablution, spreads the\\nSufrah[FN# 3] (or leather cloth); and places before me certain remnants\\nof the evening\\'s meal. It is some time before the stomach becomes\\naccustomed to such hours, but in matters of appetite, habit is\\neverything, and for health\\'s sake one should strive to eat as\\nplentifully as possible. Then sounds the Salam, or Blessings on the\\nProphet,[FN#4] an introduction to the Call of Morning Prayer. Smoking\\nsundry pipes with tenderness, as if taking leave of a friend; and until\\nthe second gun, fired at about half-past two A.M., gives the\\nImsak,[FN#4]-the order to abstain from food,-I wait the Azan,[FN#5]\\nwhich in this month is called somewhat earlier than usual. Then, after\\na ceremony termed the Niyat[FN#6] (purpose) of fasting, I say my\\n</p><p>[p.77]prayers, and prepare for repose.[FN#7] At 7 A.M. the labours of\\nthe day begin for the working classes of society; the rich spend the\\nnight in revelling, and rest in down from dawn till noon.\\n</p><p>The first thing on rising is to perform the Wuzu, or lesser ablution,\\nwhich invariably follows sleep in a reclining position; without this it\\nwould be improper to pray, to enter the Mosques, to approach a\\nreligious man, or to touch the Koran. A few pauper patients usually\\nvisit me at this hour, report the phenomena of their complaints,-which\\nthey do, by the bye, with unpleasant minuteness of detail,-and receive\\nfresh instructions. At 9 A.M. Shaykh Mohammed enters, with \"lecture\"\\nwritten upon his wrinkled brow; or I pick him up on the way, and\\nproceed straight to the Mosque Al-Azhar. After three hours\\' hard\\nreading, with little interruption from bystanders-this is long\\nvacation, most of the students being at home-comes the call to mid-day\\nprayer. The founder of Al-Islam ordained but few devotions for the\\nmorning, which is the business part of the Eastern day; but during the\\nafternoon and evening they succeed one another rapidly, and their\\nlength increases. It is then time to visit my rich patients, and\\nafterwards, by way of accustoming myself to the sun, to wander among\\nthe bookshops for an hour or two, or simply to idle in the street. At 3\\nP.M. I return home, recite the afternoon prayers, and re-apply myself\\nto study.\\n</p><p>This is the worst part of the day. In Egypt the summer nights and\\nmornings are, generally speaking,\\n</p><p>[p.78]pleasant, but the forenoons are sultry, and the afternoons are\\nserious. A wind wafting the fine dust and furnace-heat of the desert\\nblows over the city; the ground returns with interest the showers of\\ncaloric from above, and not a cloud or a vapour breaks the dreary\\nexpanse of splendour on high. There being no such comforts as Indian\\ntatties, and few but the wealthiest houses boasting glass windows, the\\ninterior of your room is somewhat more fiery than the street. Weakened\\nwith fasting, the body feels the heat trebly, and the disordered\\nstomach almost affects the brain. Every minute is counted with morbid\\nfixity of idea as it passes on towards the blessed sunset, especially\\nby those whose terrible lot is manual labour at such a season. A few\\ntry to forget their afternoon miseries in slumber, but most people take\\nthe Kaylulah, or Siesta, shortly after the meridian, holding it\\nunwholesome to sleep late in the day.\\n</p><p>As the Maghrib, the sunset hour, approaches-and how slowly it\\ncomes!-the town seems to recover from a trance. People flock to the\\nwindows and balconies, in order to watch the moment of their release.\\nSome pray, others tell their beads; while others, gathering together in\\ngroups or paying visits, exert themselves to while away the lagging\\ntime.\\n</p><p>O Gladness! at length it sounds, that gun from the citadel.\\nSimultaneously rises the sweet cry of the Mu\\'ezzin, calling men to\\nprayer, and the second cannon booms from the Abbasiyah\\nPalace,[FN#8]-\"Al Fitar! Al\\n</p><p>[p.79]Fitar!\" fast-breaking! fast-breaking! shout the people, and a hum\\nof joy rises from the silent city. Your acute ears waste not a moment\\nin conveying the delightful intelligence to your parched tongue, empty\\nstomach, and languid limbs. You exhaust a pot full of water, no matter\\nits size. You clap hurried hands[FN#9] for a pipe; you order coffee;\\nand provided with these comforts, you sit down, and calmly contemplate\\nthe coming pleasures of the evening.\\n</p><p>Poor men eat heartily at once. The rich break their fast with a light\\nmeal,-a little bread and fruit, fresh or dry, especially water-melon,\\nsweetmeats, or such digestible dishes as \"Muhallabah,\"-a thin jelly of\\nmilk, starch, and rice-flour. They then smoke a pipe, drink a cup of\\ncoffee or a glass of sherbet, and recite the evening prayers; for the\\ndevotions of this hour are delicate things, and while smoking a first\\npipe after sixteen hours\\' abstinence, time easily slips away. Then they\\nsit down to the Fatur (breakfast), the meal of the twenty-four hours,\\nand eat plentifully, if they would avoid illness.\\n</p><p>There are many ways of spending a Ramazan evening. The Egyptians have a\\nproverb, like ours of the Salernitan school:\\n</p><p>[p.80]\"After Al-Ghada rest, if it be but for two moments:\\nAfter Al-Asha[FN#10] walk, if it be but two steps.\"\\n</p><p>The streets are now crowded with a good-humoured throng of strollers;\\nthe many bent on pleasure, the few wending their way to Mosque, where\\nthe Imam recites \"Tarawih\" prayers.[FN#11] They saunter about, the\\naccustomed pipe in hand, shopping, for the stalls are open till a late\\nhour; or they sit in crowds at the coffee-house entrance, smoking\\nShishas,[FN#12] (water-pipes), chatting, and listening to\\nstory-tellers, singers and itinerant preachers. Here a bare-footed girl\\ntrills and quavers, accompanied by a noisy tambourine and a \"scrannel\\npipe\" of abominable discordance, in honour of a perverse saint whose\\ncorpse insisted upon being buried inside some respectable man\\'s\\ndwelling-house.[FN#13] The scene reminds you strongly of the Sonneurs\\nof Brittany and the Zampognari from the Abruzzian Highlands bagpiping\\nbefore the Madonna. There a tall, gaunt Maghrabi displays upon a square\\nyard of\\n</p><p>[p.81]dirty paper certain lines and blots, supposed to represent the\\nvenerable Ka\\'abah, and collects coppers to defray the expenses of his\\npilgrimage. A steady stream of loungers sets through the principal\\nthoroughfares towards the Azbakiyah Gardens, which skirt the Frank\\nquarter; there they sit in the moonlight, listening to Greek and\\nTurkish bands, or making merry with cakes, toasted grains, coffee,\\nsugared-drinks, and the broad pleasantries of Kara Gyuz[FN#14] (the\\nlocal Punch and Judy). Here the scene is less thoroughly Oriental than\\nwithin the city; but the appearance of Frank dress amongst the\\nvarieties of Eastern costume, the moon-lit sky, and the light mist\\nhanging over the deep shade of the Acacia trees-whose rich scented\\nyellow-white blossoms are popularly compared to the old Pasha\\'s\\nbeard[FN#15]-make it passing picturesque. And the traveller from the\\nfar East remarks with wonder the presence of certain ladies, whose only\\nmark of modesty is the Burka, or face-veil: upon this laxity the police\\nlooks with lenient eyes, inasmuch as, until very lately, it paid a\\nrespectable tax to the state.[FN#16]\\n</p><p>Returning to the Moslem quarter, you are bewildered\\n</p><p>[p.82]by its variety of sounds. Everyone talks, and talking here is\\nalways in extremes, either in a whisper, or in a scream; gesticulation\\nexcites the lungs, and strangers cannot persuade themselves that men so\\nconverse without being or becoming furious. All the street cries, too,\\nare in the soprano key. \"In thy protection! in thy protection!\" shouts\\na Fellah peasant to a sentinel, who is flogging him towards the\\nstation-house, followed by a tail of women, screaming, \"Ya Gharati-ya\\nDahwati-ya Hasrati-ya Nidamati-O my calamity! O my shame!\" The boys\\nhave elected a Pasha, whom they are conducting in procession, with\\nwisps of straw for Mash\\'als, or cressets, and outrunners, all huzzaing\\nwith ten-schoolboy power. \"O thy right! O thy left! O thy face! O thy\\nheel! O thy back, thy back!\" cries the panting footman, who, huge torch\\non shoulder, runs before the grandee\\'s carriage; \"Bless the Prophet and\\nget out of the way!\" \"O Allah bless him!\" respond the good Moslems,\\nsome shrinking up to the walls to avoid the stick, others rushing\\nacross the road, so as to give themselves every chance of being knocked\\ndown. The donkey boy beats his ass with a heavy palm-cudgel,-he fears\\nno treadmill here,-cursing him at the top of his voice for a \"pander,\"\\na \"Jew,\" a \"Christian,\" and a \"son of the One-eyed, whose portion is\\nEternal Punishment.\" \"O chick pease! O pips!\" sings the vendor of\\nparched grains, rattling the unsavoury load in his basket. \"Out of the\\nway, and say, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdThere is one God,\\'\" pants the industrious water-carrier,\\nladen with a skin, fit burden for a buffalo. \"Sweet-water, and gladden\\nthy soul, O lemonade!\" pipes the seller of that luxury, clanging his\\nbrass cups together. Then come the beggars, intensely Oriental. \"My\\nsupper is in Allah\\'s hands, my supper is in Allah\\'s hands! whatever\\nthou givest, that will go with thee!\" chaunts the old vagrant, whose\\nwallet perhaps contains more provision than the basket of many a\\nrespectable shopkeeper.\\n[p.83]\"Na\\'al abuk[FN#17]-rucse thy father-O brother of a naughty\\nsister!\" is the response of some petulant Greek to the touch of the old\\nman\\'s staff. \"The grave is darkness, and good deeds are its lamp!\" sing\\nthe blind women, rapping two sticks together: \"upon Allah! upon Allah!\\nO daughter!\" cry the bystanders, when the obstinate \"bint\"[FN#18]\\n(daughter) of sixty years seizes their hands, and will not let go\\nwithout extorting a farthing. \"Bring the sweet\" (i.e. fire), \"and take\\nthe full,\"[FN#19] (i.e., empty cup), euphuistically cry the\\nlong-moustached, fierce-browed Arnauts to the coffee-house keeper, who\\nstands by them charmed by the rhyming repartee that flows so readily\\nfrom their lips.\\n</p><p>\"Hanien,\" may it be pleasant to thee![FN#20] is the signal for\\nencounter.\\n</p><p>[p.84]\"Thou drinkest for ten,\" replies the other, instead of returning\\nthe usual religious salutation.\\n</p><p>\"I am the cock and thou art the hen!\" is the rejoinder,-a tart one.\\n\"Nay, I am the thick one and thou art the thin!\" resumes the first\\nspeaker, and so on till they come to equivoques which will not bear a\\nliteral English translation.\\n</p><p>And sometimes, high above the hubbub, rises the melodious voice of the\\nblind mu\\'ezzin, who, from his balcony in the beetling tower rings\\nforth, \"Hie ye to devotion! Hie ye to salvation.\" And (at\\nmorning-prayer time) he adds: \"Devotion is better than sleep! Devotion\\nis better than sleep!\" Then good Moslems piously stand up, and mutter,\\nprevious to prayer, \"Here am I at Thy call, O Allah! here am I at Thy\\ncall!\"\\n</p><p>Sometimes I walked with my friend to the citadel, and sat upon a high\\nwall, one of the outworks of Mohammed Ali\\'s Mosque, enjoying a view\\nwhich, seen by night, when the summer moon is near the full, has a\\ncharm no power of language can embody. Or escaping from \"stifled\\nCairo\\'s filth,[FN#21]\" we passed, through the Gate of Victory, into the\\nwilderness beyond the City of the Dead.[FN#22] Seated upon some mound\\nof ruins, we inhaled\\n</p><p>[p.85]the fine air of the Desert, inspiriting as a cordial, when\\nstar-light and dew-mists diversified a scene, which, by day, is one\\nbroad sea of yellow loam with billows of chalk rock, thinly covered by\\na film-like spray of sand surging and floating in the fiery wind.\\nThere, within a mile of crowded life, all is desolate; the town walls\\nseem crumbling to decay, the hovels are tenantless, and the paths\\nuntrodden; behind you lies the Wild, before you, the thousand\\ntomb-stones, ghastly in their whiteness; while beyond them the tall\\ndark forms of the Mamluk Soldans\\' towers rise from the low and hollow\\nground like the spirits of kings guarding ghostly subjects in the\\nShadowy Realm. Nor less weird than the scene are the sounds!-the\\nhyaena\\'s laugh, the howl of the wild dog, and the screech of the\\nlow-flying owl. Or we spent the evening at some Takiyah[FN#23]\\n(Darwayshes\\' Oratory), generally preferring that called the \"Gulshani,\"\\nnear the Muayyid Mosque outside the Mutawalli\\'s saintly door. There is\\nnothing attractive in its appearance. You mount a flight of ragged\\nsteps, and enter a low verandah enclosing an open stuccoed terrace,\\nwhere stands the holy man\\'s domed tomb: the two stories contain small\\ndark rooms in which the Darwayshes dwell, and the ground-floor doors\\nopen into the\\n</p><p>[p.86]verandah. During the fast-month, Zikrs[FN#24] are rarely\\nperformed in the Takiyahs: the inmates pray there in congregations, or\\nthey sit conversing upon benches in the shade. And a curious medley of\\nmen they are, composed of the choicest vagabonds from every nation of\\nAl-Islam. Beyond this I must not describe the Takiyah or the doings\\nthere, for the \"path\" of the Darwaysh may not be trodden by feet\\nprofane.\\n</p><p>Curious to see something of my old friends the Persians, I called with\\nHaji Wali upon one Mirza Husayn, who by virtue of his dignity as\\n\"Shahbandar[FN#25]\" (he calls himself \"Consul-General\"), ranks with the\\ndozen little quasi-diplomatic kings of Cairo. He suspends over his\\nlofty gate a sign-board in which the Lion and the Sun (Iran\\'s proud\\nensign) are by some Egyptian limner\\'s art metamorphosed into a\\npreternatural tabby cat grasping a scimitar, with the jolly fat face of\\na \"gay\" young lady, curls and all complete, resting fondly upon her\\npet\\'s concave back. This high dignitary\\'s reception room was a\\ncourt-yard sub dio: fronting the door were benches and cushions\\ncomposing the Sadr or high place, with the parallel rows of Diwans\\nspread down the less dignified sides, and a line of naked boards, the\\nlowest seats, ranged along the door-wall. In the middle stood three\\nlittle tables supporting three huge lanterns-as is their size so is the\\nowner\\'s dignity-each of which contained three of the largest spermaceti\\ncandles.\\n</p><p>The Haji and I entering took our seats upon the side benches with\\nhumility, and exchanged salutations with the great man on the Sadr.\\nWhen the Darbar or levee was full, in stalked the Mirza, and all arose\\nas he calmly divested himself of his shoes; and with all due\\n</p><p>[p.87]solemnity ascended his proper cushion. He is a short, thin man\\nabout thirty-five, with regular features and the usual preposterous\\nlamb-skin cap and beard, two peaked black cones at least four feet in\\nlength, measured from the tips, resting on a slender basement of pale\\nyellow face. After a quarter of an hour of ceremonies, polite\\nmutterings and low bendings with the right hand on the left breast, the\\nMirza\\'s pipe was handed to him first, in token of his dignity-at\\nTeheran he was probably an under-clerk in some government office. In\\ndue time we were all served with Kaliuns[FN#26] (Persian hookahs) and\\ncoffee by the servants, who made royal conges whenever they passed the\\ngreat man; and more than once the janissary, in dignity of belt and\\ncrooked sabre, entered the court to quicken our awe.\\n</p><p>The conversation was the usual Oriental thing. It is, for instance,\\nunderstood that you have seen strange things in strange lands.\\n</p><p>\"Voyaging-is-victory,\" quotes the Mirza; the quotation is a hackneyed\\none, but it steps forth majestic as to pause and emphasis.\\n</p><p>\"Verily,\" you reply with equal ponderousness of pronunciation and\\nnovelty of citation, \"in leaving home one learns life, yet a journey is\\na bit of Jahannam.\"\\n</p><p>Or if you are a physician the \"lieu commun\" will be,\\n\"Little-learn\\'d doctors the body destroy:\\nLittle-learn\\'d parsons the soul destroy.\"\\n</p><p>To which you will make answer, if you would pass for a man of belles\\nlettres, by the well-known lines,\\n</p><p>\"Of a truth, the physician hath power with drugs,\\nWhich, long as the patient hath life, may relieve him;\\nBut the tale of our days being duly told,\\nThe doctor is daft, and his drugs deceive him.\"\\n</p><p>After sitting there with dignity, like the rest of the guests, I took\\nmy leave, delighted with the truly Persian\\n</p><p>[p.88]\"apparatus\" of the scene. The Mirza, having no salary, lives by\\nfees extorted from his subjects, who pay rather than lack protection;\\nand his dragoman for a counter-fee will sell their interests\\nshamelessly. He is a hidalgo of blue blood in pride, pompousness and\\npoverty. There is not a sheet of writing-paper in the \"Consulate\"-when\\nthey want one a farthing is sent to the grocer\\'s-yet the Consul drives\\nout in an old carriage with four outriders, two tall-capped men\\npreceding and two following the crazy vehicle. And the Egyptians laugh\\nheartily at this display, being accustomed by Mohammed Ali to consider\\nall such parade obsolete.\\n</p><p>About half-an-hour before midnight sounds the Abrar[FN#27] or call to\\nprayer, at which time the latest wanderers return home to prepare for\\nthe Sahur, their dawn meal. You are careful on the way to address each\\nsentinel with a \"Peace be upon thee!\" especially if you have no\\nlantern, otherwise you may chance to sleep in the guard-house. And,\\nchemin faisant, you cannot but stop to gaze at streets as little like\\nwhat civilised Europe understands by that name as is an Egyptian temple\\nto the new Houses of Parliament.\\n</p><p>There are certain scenes, cannily termed \"Ken-speckle,\" which print\\nthemselves upon Memory, and which endure as long as Memory lasts,-a\\nthunder-cloud bursting upon the Alps, a night of stormy darkness off\\nthe Cape, an African tornado, and, perhaps, most awful of all, a\\nsolitary journey over the sandy Desert.\\n</p><p>Of this class is a stroll through the thoroughfares of old Cairo by\\nnight. All is squalor in the brilliancy of noon-day. In darkness you\\nsee nothing but a silhouette. When, however, the moon is high in the\\nheavens, and the summer stars rain light upon God\\'s world, there is\\nsomething not of earth in the view. A glimpse at the\\n</p><p>[p.89]strip of pale blue sky above scarcely reveals three ells of\\nbreadth: in many places the interval is less: here the copings meet,\\nand there the outriggings of the houses seem to interlace. Now they are\\nparted by a pencil of snowy sheen, then by a flood of silvery\\nsplendour; while under the projecting cornices and the huge hanging\\nbalcony-windows of fantastic wood-work, supported by gigantic brackets\\nand corbels, and under deep verandahs, and gateways, vast enough for\\nBehemoth to pass through, and in blind wynds and long cul-de-sacs, lie\\npatches of thick darkness, made visible by the dimmest of oil lamps.\\nThe arch is a favourite feature: in one place you see it a mere\\nskeleton-rib opening into some huge deserted hall; in another the ogre\\nis full of fretted stone and wood carved like lace-work. Not a line is\\nstraight, the tall dead walls of the Mosques slope over their massy\\nbuttresses, and the thin minarets seem about to fall across your path.\\nThe cornices project crookedly from the houses, while the great gables\\nstand merely by force of cohesion. And that the Line of Beauty may not\\nbe wanting, the graceful bending form of the palm, on whose topmost\\nfeathers, quivering in the cool night breeze, the moonbeam glistens,\\nsprings from a gloomy mound, or from the darkness of a mass of houses\\nalmost level with the ground. Briefly, the whole view is so strange, so\\nfantastic, so ghostly, that it seems preposterous to imagine that in\\nsuch places human beings like ourselves can be born, and live through\\nlife, and carry out the command \"increase and multiply,\" and die.\\n</p><p>[FN#1] Of course all quarrelling, abuse, and evil words are strictly\\nforbidden to the Moslem during Ramazan. If one believer insult another,\\nthe latter should repeat \"I am fasting\" three times before venturing\\nhimself to reply. Such is the wise law. But human nature in Egypt, as\\nelsewhere, is always ready to sacrifice the spirit to the letter,\\nrigidly to obey the physical part of an ordinance, and to cast away the\\nmoral, as if it were the husk and not the kernel.\\n</p>\\n<pre>[FN#2] Allah opens (the door of daily bread) is a polite way of\\n</pre>\\n<p>informing a man that you and he are not likely to do business; in other\\nwords, that you are not in want of his money.\\n[FN#3] The Sufrah is a piece of leather well tanned, and generally of a\\nyellow colour, bordered with black. It is circular, has a few small\\npouches for knives or spoons, and, by means of a thong run through\\nrings in the periphery, can be readily converted into a bag for\\ncarrying provisions on a journey. Figuratively it is used for the meal\\nitself. \"Sufrah hazir\" means that dinner is upon the table.\\n[FN#4] The Salam at this hour of the morning is confined to the\\ndevotions of Ramazan. The curious reader may consult Lane\\'s Modern\\nEgyptians, chap. 25, for a long and accurate interpretation of these\\nwords.\\n[FN#5] The summons to prayer.\\n[FN#6] In the Mohammedan church every act of devotion must be preceded\\nby what is called its Niyat, or purpose. This intention must be either\\nmentally conceived, or, as the more general rule is, audibly expressed.\\nFor instance, the worshipper will begin with \"I purpose to pray the\\nfour-bows of mid-day prayer to Allah the Almighty,\" and then he will\\nproceed to the act of worship. Moslems of the Shafe\\'i faith must\\nperform the Niyat of fasting every night for the ensuing day; the\\nMalikis, on the other hand, \"purpose\" abstinence but once for the\\nthirty days of Ramazan. Lane tells a pleasant tale of a thief in the\\nMosque saying, \"I purpose (before prayer) to carry off this nice pair\\nof new shoes!\"\\n[FN#7] Many go to sleep immediately after the Imsak, or about a quarter\\nof an hour before the dawn prayer, and do not perform their morning\\ndevotions till they awake. But this is not, strictly speaking, correct.\\n[FN#8] When the late Pasha of Egypt (H.H. Abbas Hilmi) came to power,\\nhe built a large pile of palace close outside the walls of Cairo, on\\nthe direction of Suez, and induced his courtiers to follow his example.\\nThis was done readily enough, for Asiatics, like Europeans, enjoy the\\nfine air of the desert after the rank atmosphere of towns and cities.\\nIf the successor of His Highness does not follow the usual Oriental\\nmethod of wiping away all vestiges of the predecessor, except his\\ngrave, there will be, at no distant period, a second Cairo on the site\\nof the Abbasiyah.\\n[FN#9] One of our wants is a history of the bell and its succedanai.\\nStrict Moslems have an aversion to all modifications of this\\ninstrument, striking clocks, gongs, &amp;c., because they were considered\\nby the Prophet peculiar to the devotions of Christians. He, therefore,\\ninstituted the Azan, or call to prayer, and his followers still clap\\ntheir hands when we should ring for a servant. The symbolical meaning\\nof the bell, as shown in the sistrum of Isis, seems to be the movement\\nand mixture of the elements, which is denoted by clattering noise.\\n\"Hence,\" observes a learned antiquary, \"the ringing of bells and\\nclattering of plates of metal were used in all lustrations, sacrifices,\\n&amp;c.\" We find them amongst the Jews, worn by the high priest; the Greeks\\nattached them to images of Priapus, and the Buddhists of Thibet still\\nuse them in their worship, as do the Catholics of Rome when elevating\\nthe Host.\\n[FN#10] Al-Ghada is the early dinner: Al-Asha, the supper, eaten\\nshortly after sunset. (See Lane\\'s Modern Egyptians, Chap. 5.)\\n[FN#11] Extra prayers repeated in the month of Ramazan. (Lane, Chap.\\n25, \"Tarawih.\") They take about an hour, consisting of 23 prostrations,\\nwith the Salam (or blessing on the Prophet) after every second\\nprostration.\\n[FN#12] The Shisha, or Egyptian and Syrian water-pipe, is too well\\nknown to require any description. It is filled with a kind of tobacco\\ncalled Tumbak, for which see Chap. 4 of this Volume.\\n[FN#13] Strangers often wonder to see a kind of cemetery let into a\\ndwelling-house in a crowded street. The reason is, that some obstinate\\nsaint has insisted upon being buried there, by the simple process of\\nweighing so heavily in his bier, that the bearers have been obliged to\\nplace him on the pavement. Of course, no good Moslem would object to\\nhave his ground floor occupied by the corpse of a holy man. The reader\\nwill not forget, that in Europe statues have the whims which dead\\nbodies exhibit in Egypt. So, according to the Abbe Marche, the little\\nstatue of Our Lady, lately found in the forest of Pennacom, \"became,\\nnotwithstanding her small size, heavy as a mountain, and would not\\nconsent to be removed by any one but the chaplain of the chateau.\"\\n[FN#14] Europeans compare \"Kara Gyuz\" to our Chinese shadows. He is the\\nTurkish \"Punch,\" and his pleasantries may remind the traveller of what\\nhe has read concerning the Mines and Fescennine performances of the\\nRomans. On more than one occasion, Kara Gyuz has been reported to the\\npolice for scandalously jibing and deriding consuls, Frank merchants,\\nand even Turkish dignitaries.\\n[FN#15] Mohammed Ali drained and planted the Azbakiyah, which, before\\nhis day, was covered with water and mud long after the inundation had\\nceased. The Egyptians extract a perfume, an aphrodisiac, which they\\ncall \"Fitnah,\" from this kind of Acacia.\\n[FN#16] All \"Agapemones\" are at this time suppressed, by order of His\\nHighness (Abbas Pasha), whose august mother occasionally insisted upon\\nbanishing whole colleges of Ambubaiae to Upper Egypt. As might be\\nexpected, this proceeding had a most injurious effect upon the morals\\nof society. I was once at Cairo during the ruler\\'s absence on a tour up\\nto the Nile; his departure was the signal for the general celebration\\nof Cotyttia.\\n[FN#17] For La\\'an abuk, curse thy father. So in Europe pious men have\\nsworn per diem, instead of per Deum, and \"drat\" acts for something\\nstronger.\\n[FN#18] A daughter, a girl. In Egypt, every woman expects to be\\naddressed as \"O lady!\" \"O female-pilgrim!\" \"O bride!\" or, \"O daughter!\"\\neven though she be on the wrong side of fifty. In Syria and in Arabia,\\nyou may say \"y\\'al mara!\" (O woman); but if you attempt it near the\\nNile, the answer of the offended fair one will be \"may Allah cut out\\nthy heart!\" or, \"the woman, please Allah, in thine eye!\" And if you\\nwant a violent quarrel, \"y\\'al aguz!\" (O old woman!) pronounced\\ndrawlingly,-y\\'al ago-o-ooz,-is sure to satisfy you. On the plains of\\nSorrento, in my day, it was always customary, when speaking to a\\npeasant girl, to call her \"bella fe,\" (beautiful woman), whilst the\\nworst of insults was \"vecchiarella.\" So the Spanish Calesero, under the\\nmost trying circumstances, calls his mule \"Vieja, rivieja.\" (old, very\\nold). Age, it appears, is as unpopular in Southern Europe as in Egypt.\\n[FN#19] \"Fire\" is called the \"sweet\" by euphuism, as to name it\\ndirectly would be ill-omened. So in the Moslem law, flame and water\\nbeing the instruments of Allah\\'s wrath, are forbidden to be used by\\ntemporal rulers. The \"full\" means an empty coffee cup, as we say in\\nIndia Mez barhao (\"increase the table,\") when ordering a servant to\\nremove the dishes.\\n[FN#20] Or \"pleasurably and health\": Hanien is a word taken from the\\nKoran. The proper answer to this is \"May Allah cause thee to have\\npleasure!\" Hanna-kumu\\'llah, not \"Allah yahannik!\" which I have heard\\nabominably perverted by Arnaut and other ruffians.\\n[FN#21] This in these days must be said comparatively: Ibrahim Pasha\\'s\\norder, that every housekeeper should keep the space before his house\\nproperly swept and cleaned, has made Cairo the least filthy city in the\\nEast.\\n[FN#22] Here lies the Swiss Burckhardt, who enjoyed a wonderful\\nimmunity from censure, until a certain pseudo-orientalist of the\\npresent day seized the opportunity of using the \"unscrupulous\\ntraveller\\'s\" information, and of abusing his memory. Some years ago,\\nthe sum of L20 (I am informed) was collected, in order to raise a\\nfitting monument over the discoverer of Petra\\'s humble grave. Some\\nobjection, however, was started, because Moslems are supposed to claim\\nBurckhardt as one of their own saints. Only hear the Egyptian account\\nof his death! After returning from Al-Hijaz, he taught Tajwid (Koran\\nchaunting) in the Azhar Mosque, where the learned, suspecting him to be\\nat heart an infidel, examined his person, and found the formula of the\\nMohammedan faith written in token of abhorrence upon the soles of his\\nfeet. Thereupon, the principal of the Mosque, in a transport of holy\\nindignation, did decapitate him with one blow of the sword. It only\\nremains to be observed, that nothing can be more ridiculous than the\\npopular belief, except it be our hesitating to offend the prejudices of\\nsuch believers.\\n[FN#23] A Takiyah is a place where Darwayshes have rooms, and perform\\ntheir devotions.\\n[FN#24] Certain forms of worship peculiar to Darwayshes. For a\\ndescription see Lane (Modern Egyptians, ch. 24).\\n[FN#25] Shahbandar, Harbour-King, is here equivalent to our \"Consul.\"\\n[FN#26] Written \"Ghalayun.\"\\n[FN#27] See Lane (Modern Egyptians, chap. 24).\\n</p>\\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Chapter_VI._THE_MOSQUE.\">Chapter VI.

Their Syncretism, the result of chance and precipitancy, of\\nextravagance and incuriousness, fell under eyes too ignorant to be hurt\\nby the hybrid irregularity: it was perpetuated in the so-called\\nSaracenic style, a plagiarism from the Byzantine,[FN#2] and it was\\nreiterated in the Gothic, an offshoot from the Saracenic.[FN#3] This\\nfact accounts in the Gothic style for its manifold incongruities of\\narchitecture, and for the phenomenon,-not solely attributable to the\\nbuildings\\n</p><p>[p.91]having been erected piecemeal,-of its most classic period being\\nthat of its greatest irregularity.\\n</p><p>Such \"architectural lawlessness,\" such disregard for symmetry,-the\\nresult, I believe, of an imperfect \"amalgamation and enrichment,\"-may\\ndoubtless be defended upon the grounds both of cause and of effect.\\nArchitecture is of the imitative arts, and Nature, the Myriomorphous,\\neverywhere delighting in variety, appears to abhor nothing so much as\\nperfect similarity and precise uniformity. To copy her exactly we must\\ntherefore seek that general analogy compatible with individual variety;\\nin fact, we should avoid the over-display of order and regularity. And\\nagain, it may be asserted that, however incongruous these disorderly\\nforms may appear to the conventional eye, we find it easy to surmount\\nour first antipathy. Perhaps we end in admiring them the more, as we\\nlove those faces in which irregularity of feature is compensated for by\\ndiversity and piquancy of expression.\\n</p><p>There is nothing, I believe, new in the Arab Mosque; it is an\\nunconscious revival of the forms used from the earliest ages to denote\\nby symbolism the worship of the generative and the creative gods. The\\nreader will excuse me if I only glance at a subject of which the\\ninvestigation would require a volume, and which, discussed at greater\\nlength, would be out of place in such a narrative as this.\\n</p><p>The first Mosque in Al-Islam was erected by Mohammed at Kuba, near\\nAl-Madinah: shortly afterwards, when he entered Meccah as a conqueror,\\nhe destroyed the three hundred and sixty idols of the Arab Pantheon,\\nand thus purified that venerable building from its abominations. He had\\nprobably observed in Syrian Bostra the two forms appropriated by the\\nChristians to their places of worship, the cross and the\\nparallelogramic Basilica; he therefore preferred for the prayers of the\\n\"Saving Faith\" a square,-some authors say, with, others\\n</p><p>[p.92]without, a cloister. At length in the reign of Al-Walid (A.H. 90)\\nthe cupola, the niche, and the minaret made their appearance; and what\\nis called the Saracenic style became for ever the order of the Moslem\\nworld.\\n</p><p>The Hindus I believe to have been the first who symbolised by an\\nequilateral triangle their peculiar cult, the Yoni-Linga: in their\\ntemple architecture, it became either a conoid or a perfect pyramid.\\nEgypt denoted it by the obelisk, peculiar to that country; and the form\\nappeared in different parts of the world: thus in England it was a mere\\nupright stone, and in Ireland a round tower. This we might expect to\\nsee. D\\'Hancarville and Brotier have successfully traced the worship\\nitself, in its different modifications, to all people: the symbol would\\ntherefore be found everywhere. The old Arab minaret is a plain\\ncylindrical or polygonal tower, without balcony or stages, widely\\ndifferent from the Turkish, modern Egyptian, and Hijazi combinations of\\ntube and prism, happily compared by a French traveller to \"une\\nchandelle coiffee d\\'un eteignoir.\" And finally the ancient minaret,\\nmade solid as all Gothic architecture is, and provided with a belfry,\\nbecame the spire and steeple of our ancestors.\\n</p><p>&gt;From time immemorial, in hot and rainy lands, a hypaethral court,\\neither round or square, surrounded by a covered portico, was used for\\nthe double purpose of church and mart,-a place where God and Mammon\\nwere worshipped turn by turn. In some places we find rings of stones,\\nlike the Persian Pyroetheia; in others, circular concave buildings\\nrepresenting the vault of heaven, where Fire, the divine symbol, was\\nworshipped; and in Arabia, columnar aisles, which, surmounted by the\\nsplendid blue vault, resemble the palm-grove. The Greeks adopted this\\nidea in the fanes of Creator Bacchus; and at Pozzuoli, near Naples, it\\nmay be seen in the building vulgarly called the Temple of Serapis. It\\nwas equally well known\\n</p><p>[p.93]to the Kelts: in some places the Temenos was a circle, in others\\na quadrangle. And such to the present day is the Mosque of Al-Islam.\\n</p><p>Even the Riwak or porches surrounding the area in the Mosque are\\nrevivals of older forms. \"The range of square buildings which enclose\\nthe temple of Serapis are not, properly speaking, parts of the fane,\\nbut apartments of the priests, places for victims, and sacred utensils,\\nand chapels dedicated to subordinate deities, introduced by a more\\ncomplicated and corrupt worship, and probably unknown to the founders\\nof the original edifice.\" The cloisters in the Mosque became cells,\\nused as lecture rooms, and stores for books bequeathed to the college.\\nThey are unequal, because some are required to be of larger, others to\\nbe of smaller, dimensions. The same reason causes difference of size\\nwhen the building is distributed into four hyposteles opening upon the\\narea: the porch in the direction of the Ka\\'abah, where worshippers\\nmostly congregate, demands greater depth than the other three. The\\nwings were not unfrequently made unequal, either from want of building\\nmaterials, or because the same extent of accommodation was not required\\nin both. The columns were of different substances; some of handsome\\nmarble, others of rough stone meanly plastered over, with dissimilar\\ncapitals, vulgarly cut shafts of various sizes; here with a pediment,\\nthere without, now turned upside down, then joined together by halves\\nin the centre, and almost invariably nescient of intercolumnar rule.\\nThis is the result of Byzantine syncretism, carelessly and ignorantly\\ngrafted upon Arab ideas of the natural and the sublime. Loving and\\nadmiring the great, or rather the big in plan,[FN#4]} they care\\n</p><p>[p.94]little for the execution of mere details, and they have not the\\nacumen to discern the effect which clumsy workmanship, crooked lines,\\nand visible joints,-parts apparently insignificant,-exercise upon the\\nwhole of an edifice. Their use of colours was a false taste, commonly\\ndisplayed by mankind in their religious houses, and statues of the\\ngods. The Hindus paint their pagodas, inside and outside; and rub\\nvermilion, in token of honour, over their deities. The Persian Colossi\\nof Kaiomars and his consort on the Balkh road and the Sphinx of Egypt,\\nas well as the temples of the Nile, still show traces of artificial\\ncomplexion. The fanes in classic Greece have been dyed. In the Forum\\nRomanum, one of the finest buildings, still bears stains of the Tyrian\\npurple. And to mention no other instances, in the churches and belfries\\nof Modern Italy, we see alternate bands of white and black material so\\ndisposed as to give them the appearance of giant zebras. The origin of\\n\"Arabesque\" ornament must be referred to one of the principles of\\nAl-Islam. The Moslem, forbidden by his law to decorate his Mosque with\\nstatuary and pictures,[FN#5] supplied their place with quotations from\\nthe Koran, and inscriptions, \"plastic metaphysics,\" of marvellous\\nperplexity.\\n</p><p>[p.95]His alphabet lent itself to the purpose, and hence probably arose\\nthat almost inconceivable variety of lace-like fretwork, of\\nincrustations, of Arabesques, and of geometric flowers, in which his\\neye delights to lose itself.[FN#6]\\n</p><p>The Meccan Mosque became a model to the world of Al-Islam, and the\\nnations that embraced the new faith copied the consecrated building, as\\nreligiously as Christendom produced imitations of the Holy\\nSepulchre.[FN#7] The Mosque of Omar at Jerusalem, of Amru at Babylon on\\nthe Nile, and of Taylun at Cairo were erected, with some trifling\\nimprovements, such as arched cloisters and inscribed cornices, upon the\\nplan of the Ka\\'abah. From Egypt and Palestine the ichnography spread\\nfar and wide. It was modified, as might be expected, by national taste;\\nwhat in Arabia was simple and elegant became highly ornate in\\nSpain,[FN#8] florid in Turkey, sturdy in Syria, and effeminate in\\nIndia. Still divergence of detail had not, even after the lapse of\\ntwelve centuries, materially altered the fundamental form.\\n</p><p>[p.96]Perhaps no Eastern city affords more numerous or more accessible\\nspecimens of Mosque architecture than Cairo. Between 300 and 400 places\\nof worship;[FN#9] some stately piles, others ruinous hovels, many new,\\nmore decaying and earthquake-shaken, with minarets that rival in\\nobliquity the Pisan monster, are open to the traveller\\'s inspection.\\nAnd Europeans by following the advice of their hotel-keeper have\\npenetrated, and can penetrate, into any one they please.[FN#10] If\\narchitecture be really what I believe it to be, the highest expression\\nof a people\\'s artistic feeling,-highest because it includes all\\nothers,-to compare the several styles of the different epochs, to\\nobserve how each monarch building his own Mosque, and calling it by his\\nown name, identified the manner of the monument with himself, and to\\ntrace the gradual decadence of art through one thousand two hundred\\nyears, down to the present day, must be a work of no ordinary interest\\nto Orientalists. The limits of my plan, however, compel me to place\\nonly the heads of the argument before the reader. May I be allowed to\\nexpress a hope that it will induce some learned traveller to\\ninvestigate a subject in every way worthy his attention?\\n</p><p>The desecrated Jami\\' Taylun (ninth century) is simple and massive, yet\\nelegant, and in some of its details peculiar.[FN#11] One of the four\\ncolonnades[FN#12] still remains unoccupied\\n</p><p>[p.97]by paupers to show the original magnificence of the building; the\\nother porches are walled up, and inhabited. In the centre of a\\nquadrangle about 100 paces square is a domed building springing from a\\nsquare which occupies the proper place of the Ka\\'abah. This\\n\"Jami\\'[FN#13]\" Cathedral is interesting as a point of comparison. If it\\nbe an exact copy of the Meccan temple as it stood in A.D. 879, it shows\\nthat the latter has greatly altered in this our modern day.\\n</p><p>Next in date to the Taylun Mosque is that of the Sultan al-Hakim, third\\nCaliph of the Fatimites, and founder of the Druze mysteries. The\\nminarets are remarkable in shape, as well as size: they are unprovided\\nwith the usual outer gallery, they are based upon a cube of masonry,\\nand they are pierced above with apertures apparently meaningless. A\\nlearned Cairene informed me that these spires were devised by the\\neccentric monarch to disperse, like large censers, fragrant smoke over\\nthe city during the hours of prayer. The Azhar and Hasanayn[FN#14]\\nMosques are simple and artless piles, celebrated for sanctity, but\\nremarkable for nothing save ugliness. Few buildings, however, are\\nstatelier in appearance,\\n</p><p>[p.98]or give a nobler idea of both founder and architect than that\\nwhich bears Sultan Hasan\\'s name. The stranger stands awe-struck before\\nwalls high towering without a single break, a hypaethral court severe\\nin masculine beauty, a gateway that might suit the palace of the\\nTitans, and a lofty minaret of massive grandeur. This Mosque (finished\\nabout A.D. 1363), with its fortress aspect, owns no more relationship\\nto the efforts of a later age than does Canterbury Cathedral to an\\nAnglo-Indian \"Gothic.\" For dignified beauty and refined taste, the\\nMosque and tomb of Kaid Bey and the other Mamluk kings are admirable.\\nEven in their present state, picturesqueness presides over decay, and\\nthe traveller has seldom seen aught more striking than the rich light\\nof the stained glass pouring through the first shades of evening upon\\nthe marble floor.\\n</p><p>The modern Mosques must be visited to see Egyptian architecture in its\\ndecline and fall. That of Sittna Zaynab (our Lady Zaynab), founded by\\nMurad Bey, the Mamluk, and interrupted by the French invasion, shows,\\neven in its completion, some lingering traces of taste. But nothing can\\nbe more offensive than the building which every tourist flogs donkey in\\nhis hurry to see-old Mohammed Ali\\'s \"Folly\" in the citadel. Its Greek\\narchitect has toiled to caricature a Mosque to emulate the glories of\\nour English \"Oriental Pavilion.\" Outside, as Monckton Milnes sings,\\n</p><p>\"The shining minarets, thin and high,\"\\n</p><p>are so thin, so high above the lumpy domes, that they\\n</p><p>[p.99]look like the spindles of crouching crones, and are placed in\\nfull sight of Sultan Hasan the Giant, so as to derive all the\\ndisadvantages of the contrast. Is the pointed arch forgotten by man,\\nthat this hapless building should be disgraced by large and small\\nparallelograms of glass and wood,[FN#15] so placed and so formed as to\\ngive its exterior the appearance of a European theatre coiffe with\\nOriental cupolas? Outside as well as inside, money has been lavished\\nupon alabaster full of flaws; round the bases of pillars run gilt\\nbands; in places the walls are painted with streaks to resemble marble,\\nand the wood-work is overlaid with tinsel gold. After a glance at these\\nabominations, one cannot be surprised to hear the old men of Egypt\\nlament that, in spite of European education, and of prizes encouraging\\ngeometry and architecture, modern art offers a melancholy contrast to\\nantiquity. It is said that H. H. Abbas Pasha proposes to erect for\\nhimself a Mosque that shall far surpass the boast of the last\\ngeneration. I venture to hope that his architect will light the \"sacred\\nfire\" from Sultan Hasan\\'s, not from Mohammed Ali\\'s, Turco-Grecian\\nsplendours. The former is like the genuine Osmanli of past ages,\\nfierce, cold, with a stalwart frame, index of a strong mind-there was a\\nsullen grandeur about the man. The latter is the pert and puny modern\\nTurk in pantaloons, frock coat and Fez, ill-dressed, ill-conditioned,\\nand ill-bred, body and soul.\\n</p><p>[p.100]We will now enter the Mosque Al-Azhar. At the dwarf wooden\\nrailing we take off our slippers, hold them in the left hand, sole to\\nsole, that no dirt may fall from them, and cross the threshold with the\\nright foot, ejaculating Bismillah, &amp;c. Next we repair to the Mayza\\'ah,\\nor large tank, for ablution, without which it is unlawful to appear in\\nthe House of Allah. We then seek some proper place for devotion, place\\nour slippers on some other object in front of us to warn the lounger,\\nand perform a two-bow prayer in honour of the Mosque.[FN#16] This done,\\nwe may wander about, and inspect the several objects of curiosity.\\n</p><p>The moon shines splendidly upon a vast open court, paved with stones\\nwhich are polished like glass by the feet of the Faithful. There is\\ndarkness in the body of the building, a large oblong hall, at least\\ntwice too lengthy for its height, supported by a forest of pillars,\\nthin, poor-looking, crooked marble columns, planted avenue-like, upon\\ntorn and dirty matting. A few oil lamps shed doubtful light over scanty\\ngroups, who are debating some point of grammar, or are listening to the\\nwords of wisdom that fall from the mouth of a Wa\\'iz.[FN#17] Presently\\nthey will leave the hypostyle, and throw themselves upon the flags of\\nthe quadrangle, where they may enjoy the open air and avoid some fleas.\\nIt is now \"long vacation\": so the holy building has become a kind of\\nCaravanserai for travellers;\\n</p><p>[p.101]perhaps a score of nations meet in it; there is a confusion of\\ntongues, and the din at times is deafening. Around the court runs a\\ntolerably well-built colonnade, whose entablature is garnished with\\ncrimson arabesques, and in the inner wall are pierced apartments, now\\nclosed with plank doors. Of the Riwak, as the porches are called, the\\nAzhar contains twenty-four, one for each recognised nation in Al-Islam,\\nand of these fifteen are still open to students.[FN#18] Inside them we\\nfind nothing but matting and a pile of large dingy wooden boxes, which\\nonce contained the college library; they are now, generally speaking,\\nempty.[FN#19]\\n</p><p>There is nothing worth seeing in the cluster of little dark chambers\\nthat form the remainder of the Azhar. Even the Zawiyat al-Umyan (or the\\nBlind men\\'s Oratory), a place where so many \"town and gown rows\" have\\nemanated, is rendered interesting only by the fanaticism of its\\ninmates, and the certainty that, if recognised in this\\n</p><p>[p.102]sanctum, we shall run the gauntlet under the staves of its\\nproprietors, the angry blind.\\n</p><p>The Azhar is the grand collegiate Mosque of this city,-the Christ\\nChurch, in fact, of Cairo,-once celebrated throughout the world of\\nAl-Islam. It was built, I was told, originally in poor style by one\\nJauhar al-Kaid,[FN#20] originally the slave of a Moorish merchant, in\\nconsequence of a dream that ordered him to \"erect a place whence the\\nlight of science should shine upon Al-Islam.\"\\n</p><p>It gradually increased by \"Wakf[FN#21]\" (entailed bequests) of lands,\\nmoney, and books; and pious rulers made a point of adding to its size\\nand wealth. Of late years it has considerably declined, the result of\\nsequestrations, and of the diminished esteem in which the purely\\nreligious sciences are now held in the land of Egypt.[FN#22] Yet it is\\ncalculated that between 2000 and 3000 students of all nations and ages\\nreceive instruction here gratis.\\n</p><p>[p.103]Each one is provided with bread, in a quantity determined by the\\namount of endowment, at the Riwak set apart for his nation,[FN#23] with\\nsome article of clothing on festival days, and a few piastres once a\\nyear. The professors, who are about 150 in number, may not take fees\\nfrom their pupils; some lecture on account of the religious merit of\\nthe action, others to gain the high title of \"Teacher in Al\\nAzhar.[FN#24]\" Six officials receive stipends from the government,-the\\nShaykh al-Jami\\' or dean, the Shaykh al-Sakka, who regulates the\\nprovision of water for ablution, and others that may be called heads of\\ndepartments.\\n</p><p>The following is the course of study in the Azhar. The school-boy of\\nfour or five years\\' standing has been taught, by a liberal application\\nof the maxim \"the Green Rod is of the Trees of Paradise,\" to chant the\\nKoran without understanding it, the elementary rules of arithmetic,\\nand, if he is destined to be a learned man, the art of writing.[FN#25]\\nHe then registers his name in Al-Azhar, and applies\\n</p><p>[p.104]himself to the branches of study most cultivated in Al-Islam,\\nnamely Nahw (syntax), Fikh (the law), Hadis (the traditions of the\\nProphet), and Tafsir, or Exposition of the Koran.\\n</p><p>The young Egyptian reads at the same time Sarf, or Inflexion, and Nahw\\n(syntax). But as Arabic is his mother-tongue, he is not required to\\nstudy the former so deeply as are the Turks, the Persians, and the\\nIndians. If he desire, however, to be a proficient, he must carefully\\nperuse five books in Sarf,[FN#26] and six in Nahw.[FN#27]\\n</p><p>[p.105]Master of grammar, our student now applies himself to its proper\\nend and purpose, Divinity. Of the four schools those of Abu Hanifah and\\nAl-Shafe\\'i are most common in Cairo; the followers of Ibn Malik abound\\nonly in Southern Egypt and the Berberah country, and the Hanbali is\\nalmost unknown. The theologian begins with what is called a Matn or\\ntext, a short, dry, and often obscure treatise, a mere string of\\nprecepts; in fact, the skeleton of the subject. This he learns by\\nrepeated perusal, till he can quote almost every passage literatim. He\\nthen passes to its \"Sharh,\" or commentary, generally the work of some\\nother savant, who explains the difficulty of the text, amplifies its\\nLaconicisms, enters into exceptional cases, and deals with principles\\nand reasons, as well as with mere precept. A difficult work will\\nsometimes require \"Hashiyah,\" or \"marginal notes\"; but this aid has a\\nbad name:-\\n</p><p>\"Who readeth with note,\\nBut learneth by rote,\"\\n</p><p>says a popular doggrel. The reason is, that the student\\'s reasoning\\npowers being little exercised, he learns to depend upon the dixit of a\\nmaster rather than to think for himself. It also leads to the neglect\\nof another practice, highly advocated by the Eastern pedagogue.\\n</p><p>\"The lecture is one.\\nThe dispute (upon the subject of the lecture) is one thousand.\"\\n</p><p>In order to become a Fakih, or divine of distinguished fame, the\\nfollower of Abu Hanifah must peruse about ten volumes,[FN#28] some of\\nhuge size, written in a diffuse style;\\n</p><p>[p.106]the Shafe\\'i\\'s reading is not quite so extensive.[FN#29] Theology\\nis much studied, because it leads directly to the gaining of daily\\nbread, as priest or tutor; and other scientific pursuits are neglected\\nfor the opposite reason.\\n</p><p>The theologian in Egypt, as in other parts of Al-Islam, must have a\\nsuperficial knowledge of the Prophet\\'s traditions. Of these there are\\neight well known collections,[FN#30] but only the first three are\\ngenerally read.\\n</p><p>School-boys are instructed, almost when in their infancy, to intone the\\nKoran; at the university they are\\n</p><p>[p.107]taught a more exact system of chanting. The style called \"Hafs\"\\nis most common in Egypt, as it is indeed throughout the Moslem world.\\nAnd after learning to read the holy volume, some savans are ambitious\\nenough to wish to understand it: under these circumstances they must\\ndive into the \\'Ilm al-Tafsir,[FN#31] or the Exegesis of the Koran.\\n</p><p>Our student is now a perfect Fakih or Mulla.[FN#32] But\\n</p><p>[p.108]the poor fellow has no scholarship or fellowship-no easy\\ntutorship-no fat living to look forward to. After wasting\\n</p><p>[p.109]seven years, or twice seven years, over his studies, and reading\\ntill his brain is dizzy, his digestion gone, and his eyes half blind,\\nhe must either starve upon college alms, or squat, like my old Shaykh\\nMohammed, in a druggist\\'s shop, or become pedagogue and preacher in\\nsome country place, on the pay of L8 per annum. With such prospects it\\nis wonderful how the Azhar can present any attractions; but the\\nsouthern man is essentially an idler, and many become Olema, like\\nCapuchins, in order to do nothing. A favoured few rise to the degree of\\nMudarris (professors), and thence emerge Kazis and Muftis. This is\\nanother inducement to matriculate; every undergraduate having an eye\\nupon the Kazi-ship, with as much chance of obtaining it as the country\\nparocco has of becoming a cardinal. Others again devote themselves to\\nlaical pursuits, degenerate into Wakils (lawyers), or seek their\\nfortunes as Katibs-public or private accountants.\\n</p><p>To conclude this part of the subject, I cannot agree with Dr. Bowring\\nwhen he harshly says, upon the subject of Moslem education: \"The\\ninstruction given by the Doctors of the Law in the religious schools,\\nfor the formation of the Mohammedan priesthood, is of the most\\nworthless character.\"[FN#33] His opinion is equally open to\\n</p><p>[p.110]objection with that of those who depreciate the law itself\\nbecause it deals rather in precepts than in principle, in ceremonies\\nand ordinances rather than in ethics and aesthetics. Both are what\\nEastern faiths and Eastern training have ever been,-both are eminently\\nadapted for the Oriental mind. When the people learn to appreciate\\nethics, and to understand psychics and aesthetics, the demand will\\ncreate a supply. Meanwhile they leave transcendentalism to their poets\\nand philosophers, and they busy themselves with preparing for heaven by\\npractising the only part of their faith now intelligible to them-the\\nMaterial.\\n</p><p>It is not to be supposed that a nation in this stage of civilisation\\ncould be so fervently devout as the Egyptians are, without the bad\\nleaven of bigotry. The same tongue which is employed in blessing Allah,\\nis, it is conceived, doing its work equally well in cursing Allah\\'s\\nenemies. Wherefore the Kafir is denounced by every sex, age, class, and\\ncondition, by the man of the world,[FN#34] as by the boy at school; and\\nout of, as well as in, the Mosque. If you ask your friend who is the\\nperson with a black turband, he replies,\\n</p><p>\"A Christian. Allah make his Countenance cold!\"\\n</p><p>If you inquire of your servant, who are the people singing in the next\\nhouse, it is ten to one that his answer will be,\\n</p><p>\"Jews. May their lot be Jahannam!\"\\n</p><p>It appears unintelligible, still it is not less true, that Egyptians\\nwho have lived as servants under European roofs for years, retain the\\nliveliest loathing for the manners\\n</p><p>[p.111]and customs of their masters. Few Franks, save those who have\\nmixed with the Egyptians in Oriental disguise, are aware of their\\nrepugnance to, and contempt for, Europeans-so well is the feeling\\nveiled under the garb of innate politeness, and so great is their\\nreserve when conversing with those of strange religions. I had a good\\nopportunity of ascertaining the truth when the first rumour of a\\nRussian war arose. Almost every able-bodied man spoke of hastening to\\nthe Jihad,-a crusade, or holy war,-and the only thing that looked like\\napprehension was the too eager depreciation of their foes. All seemed\\ndelighted with the idea of French co-operation, for, somehow or other,\\nthe Frenchman is everywhere popular. When speaking of England, they\\nwere not equally easy: heads were rolled, pious sentences were\\nejaculated, and finally out came the old Eastern cry, \"Of a truth they\\nare Shaytans, those English.[FN#35]\" The Austrians are despised,\\nbecause the East knows nothing of them since the days when Osmanli\\nhosts threatened the gates of Vienna. The Greeks are hated as clever\\nscoundrels, ever ready to do Al-Islam a mischief. The Maltese, the\\ngreatest of cowards off their own ground, are regarded with a profound\\ncontempt: these are the proteges which bring the British nation into\\ndisrepute at Cairo. And Italians are known chiefly as \"istruttori\" and\\n\"distruttori\"[FN#36]-doctors, druggists, and pedagogues.\\n</p><p>Yet Egyptian human nature is, like human nature everywhere,\\ncontradictory. Hating and despising Europeans, they still long for\\nEuropean rule. This people admire\\n</p><p>[p.112]an iron-handed and lion-hearted despotism; they hate a timid and\\na grinding tyranny.[FN#37] Of all foreigners, they would prefer the\\nFrench yoke,-a circumstance which I attribute to the diplomatic skill\\nand national dignity of our neighbours across the Channel.[FN#38] But\\nwhatever European nation secures Egypt will win a treasure. Moated on\\nthe north and south by seas, with a glacis of impassable deserts to the\\neastward and westward, capable of supporting an army of 180,000 men, of\\npaying a\\n</p><p>[p.113]heavy tribute, and yet able to show a considerable surplus of\\nrevenue, this country in western hands will command India, and by a\\nship-canal between Pelusium and Suez would open the whole of Eastern\\nAfrica.[FN#39]\\n</p><p>There is no longer much to fear from the fanaticism of the people, and\\na little prudence would suffice to command the interests of the\\nMosque.[FN#40] The chiefs of corporations,[FN#41] in the present state\\nof popular feeling, would offer [p.114]even less difficulty to an\\ninvader or a foreign ruler than the Olema. Briefly, Egypt is the most\\ntempting prize which the East holds out to the ambition of Europe, not\\nexcepted even the Golden Horn.\\n</p><p>[FN#1] In the capitals of the columns, for instance.\\n[FN#2] This direct derivation is readily detected in the Mosques at Old\\nCairo.\\n[FN#3] The roof supported by arches resting on pillars, was unknown to\\nclassic antiquity, and in the earliest ages of Al-Islam, the cloisters\\nwere neither arched nor domed. A modern writer justly observes, \"A\\ncompound of arcade and colonnade was suggested to the architects of the\\nMiddle Ages by the command that ancient buildings gave them of marble\\ncolumns.\"\\n[FN#4] \"The Oriental mind,\" says a clever writer on Indian subjects,\\n\"has achieved everything save real greatness of aim and execution.\"\\nThat the Arab mind always aimed, and still aims, at the physically\\ngreat is sufficiently evident. Nothing affords the Meccans greater\\npride than the vast size of their temple. Nothing is more humiliating\\nto the people of Al-Madinah than the comparative smallness of their\\nMosque. Still, with a few exceptions, Arab greatness is the vulgar\\ngreat, not the grand.\\n[FN#5] That is to say, imitations of the human form. All the doctors of\\nAl-Islam, however, differ on this head: some absolutely forbidding any\\ndelineation of what has life, under pain of being cast into hell;\\nothers permitting pictures even of the bodies, though not of the faces,\\nof men. The Arabs are the strictest of Misiconists; yet even they allow\\nplans and pictures of the Holy Shrines. Other nations are comparatively\\nlax. The Alhambra abounds in paintings and frescoes. The Persians never\\nobject to depict in books and on walls the battles of Rustam, and the\\nTurks preserve in the Seraglio treasury of Constantinople portraits, by\\nGreeks and other artists, of their Sultans in regular succession.\\n[FN#6] This is at least a purer taste than that of our Gothic\\narchitects, who ornamented their cathedrals with statuary so\\ninappropriate as to suggest to the antiquary remains of the worship of\\nthe Hellespontine god.\\n[FN#7] At Bruges, Bologna, (St. Stefano), and Nurnberg, there are, if I\\nrecollect right, imitations of the Holy Sepulchre, although the\\n\"palmer\" might not detect the resemblance at first sight. That in the\\nChurch of Jerusalem at Bruges was built by a merchant, who travelled\\nthree times to Palestine in order to ensure correctness, and totally\\nfailed. \"Arab art,\" says a writer in the \"Athenaeum,\" \"sprang from the\\nKoran, as the Gothic did from the Bible.\" He should have remembered,\\nthat Arab art, in its present shape, was borrowed by Al-Walid from the\\nGreeks, and, perhaps, in part from the Persians and the Hindus, but\\nthat the model buildings existed at Meccah, and in Al-Yaman, centuries\\nbefore the people had \"luxurious shawls and weavings of Cashmere\" to\\nsuggest mural decoration.\\n[FN#8] See Theophile Gautier\\'s admirable description of the Mosque at\\nCordova.\\n[FN#9] Joseph Pitts, of Exeter, declares that Cairo contained in his\\nday (A.D. 1678-93) 5 or 6000 Mosques, public and private; at the same\\ntime he corrects Mr. Collins, who enumerated 6000 public, and 20,000\\nparticular buildings, and M. de Thevenot, who (Part I. p. 129),\\nsupplied the city with 23,000!\\n[FN#10] In Niebuhr\\'s time, a Christian passing one of the very holy\\nbuildings on foot was liable to be seized and circumcised. All Mosques\\nmay now be entered with certain precautions. When at Cairo, I heard\\noccasionally of a Frank being spat at and insulted, but the instances\\nwere rare.\\n[FN#11] The \"Handbook\" contains the story current among the learned\\nconcerning the remarkable shape of the minaret.\\n[FN#12] The columns support pointed arches, which, therefore, were\\nknown at Cairo 200 years before they were introduced into England. By\\nthe discoveries of M. Mariette, it is now ascertained that the\\nEgyptians were perfectly acquainted with the round arch and key-stone\\nat a period antecedent to the architectural existence of Greece.\\n[FN#13] A \"Jami\\'\" is a place where people assemble to pray-a house of\\npublic worship. A \"Masjid\" is any place of prayer, private or public.\\nFrom \"Masjid\" we derive our \"Mosque\": its changes on the road to Europe\\nare almost as remarkable as that described in the satiric lines,-\\n\"Alfana vient d\\'equus, sans doute,\\nMais il faut avouer aussi,\\nQu en venant de la jusqu\\'ici\\nIl a bien change sur la route.\"\\n[FN#14] So called, because supposed to contain relics of Hasan and\\nHusayn, the martyred grandsons of Mohammed. The tradition is little\\ncredited, and the Persians ostentatiously avoid visiting the place.\\n\"You are the first \\'Ajami that ever said the Fatihah at this holy\\nspot,\" quoth the Mujawir, or guardian of the tomb, after compelling me,\\nalmost by force, to repeat the formula, which he recited with the\\nprospect of a few piastres.\\n[FN#15] This is becoming the fashion for young Egyptians, who will\\nreadily receive a pair of common green persiennes in exchange for fine\\nold windows of elaborately carved wood. They are as sensible in a\\nvariety of other small matters. Natives of a hot climate generally wear\\nslippers of red and yellow leather, because they are cool and\\ncomfortable: on the banks of the Nile, the old chaussure is gradually\\nyielding to black shoes, which blister the feet with heat, but are\\nEuropean, and, therefore, bon ton. It must, however, be confessed that\\nthe fine old carved wood-work of the windows was removed because it was\\nfound to be dangerous in cases of fire.\\n[FN#16] Irreligious men neglect this act of propriety. There are many\\nin Egypt who will habitually transgress one of the fundamental orders\\nof their faith, namely, never to pray when in a state of religious\\nimpurity. In popular Argot, prayer without ablution is called Salat\\nMamlukiyah, or \"slaves\\' prayers,\" because such men perform their\\ndevotions only in order to avoid the master\\'s staff. Others will touch\\nthe Koran when impure, a circumstance which highly disgusts Indian\\nMoslems.\\n[FN#17] An \"adviser,\" or \"lecturer,\"-any learned man who, generally in\\nthe months of Ramazan and Muharram, after the Friday service and\\nsermon, delivers a discourse upon the principles of Al-Islam.\\n[FN#18] Amongst them is a foundation for Jawi scholars. Some of our\\nauthors, by a curious mistake, have confounded Moslem Jawa (by the\\nEgyptians pronounced Gawa), with \"Goa,\" the Christian colony of the\\nPortuguese.\\n[FN#19] Cairo was once celebrated for its magnificent collections of\\nbooks. Besides private libraries, each large Mosque had its\\nbibliotheca, every MS. of which was marked with the word \"Wakf\"\\n(entailed bequest), or \"Wukifa l\\'Illahi Ta\\'ala\" (bequeathed to God\\nAlmighty). But Cairo has now for years supplied other countries with\\nbooks, and the decay of religious zeal has encouraged the unprincipled\\nto steal and sell MSS. marked with the warning words. The Hijaz, in\\nparticular, has been inundated with books from Egypt. Cairo has still\\nsome large libraries, but most of them are private property, and the\\nproprietors will not readily lend or give access to their treasures.\\nThe principal opportunity of buying books is during the month Ramazan,\\nwhen they are publicly sold in the Azhar Mosque. The Orientalist will,\\nhowever, meet with many disappointments; besides the difficulty of\\ndiscovering good works, he will find in the booksellers, scribes, et\\nhoc genus omne, a finished race of scoundrels.\\n[FN#20] Lane (Mod. Egyptians) has rectified Baron von\\nHammer-Purgstall\\'s mistake concerning the word \"Azhar\"; our English\\nOrientalist translates it the \"splendid Mosque.\" I would venture to\\nadd, that the epithet must be understood in a spiritual and not in a\\nmaterial sense. Wilkinson attributes the erection of the building to\\nJauhar al-Kaid, general under Al-Moaz, about A.D. 970. Wilson ascribes\\nit partly to Al-Moaz the Fatimite (A.D. 973), partly to his general and\\nsuccessor, Al-Hakim (?).\\n[FN#21] Wakf, property become mortmain. My friend Yacoub Artin declares\\nthat the whole Nile Valley has parcel by parcel been made Wakf at some\\ntime or other, and then retaken.\\n[FN#22] If I may venture to judge, after the experience of a few\\nmonths, there is now a re-action in favour of the old system. Mohammed\\nAli managed to make his preparatory, polytechnic, and other schools,\\nthoroughly distasteful to the people, and mothers blinded their\\nchildren, to prevent their being devoted for life to infidel studies.\\nThe printing-press, contrasting in hideousness with the beauty of the\\nwritten character, and the contemptible Arabic style of the various\\nworks translated by order of government from the European languages,\\nhave placed arms in the hands of the orthodox party.\\n[FN#23] Finding the Indian Riwak closed, and hearing that an endowment\\nstill belonged to it, I called twice upon the Shaykh or Dean, wishing\\nto claim the stipend as a precedent. But I failed in finding him at\\nhome, and was obliged to start hurriedly for Suez. The Indians now\\ngenerally study in the Sulaymaniyah, or Afghan College.\\n[FN#24] As the attending of lectures is not compulsory, the result is\\nthat the lecturer is always worth listening to. May I commend this\\nconsideration to our college reformers at home? In my day, men were\\ncompelled to waste-notoriously to waste-an hour or two every morning,\\nfor the purpose of putting a few pounds sterling into the pocket of\\nsome droning Don.\\n[FN#25] The would-be calligrapher must go to a Constantinople Khwajah\\n(schoolmaster), and after writing about two hours a day regularly\\nthrough a year or two, he will become, if he has the necessary\\ndisposition, a skilful penman. This acquirement is but little valued in\\nthe present day, as almost nothing is to be gained by it. The Turks\\nparticularly excel in the ornamental character called \"Suls.\" I have\\nseen some Korans beautifully written; and the late Pasha gave an\\nimpetus to this branch of industry, by forbidding, under the plea of\\nreligious scruples, the importation of the incorrect Korans cheaply\\nlithographed by the Persians at Bombay. The Persians surpass the Turks\\nin all but the Suls writing. Of late years, the Pashas of Cairo have\\nemployed a gentleman from Khorasan, whose travelling name is \"Mirza\\nSanglakh\" to decorate their Mosques with inscriptions. I was favoured\\nwith a specimen of his art, and do not hesitate to rank him the first\\nof his age, and second to none amongst the ancients but those Raphaels\\nof calligraphy, Mir of Shiraz, and Rahman of Herat. The Egyptians and\\nArabs, generally speaking, write a coarse and clumsy hand, and, as\\nusual in the East, the higher the rank of the writer is, the worse his\\nscrawl becomes.\\n[FN#26] The popular volumes are, 1. Al-Amsilah, showing the simple\\nconjugation of the triliteral verb; 2. Bisi\\'a, the work of some unknown\\nauthor, explaining the formation of the verb into increased infinities,\\nthe quadrilateral verb, &amp;c.; 3. The Maksu\\'a, a well-known book written\\nby the great Imam Abu\\' Hanifah; 4. The \"Izzi,\" an explanatory treatise,\\nthe work of a Turk, \"Izzat Effendi.\" And lastly, the Marah of Ahmad\\nal-Sa\\'udi. These five tracts are bound together in a little volume,\\nprinted at the government establishment. Al-Amsilah is explained in\\nTurkish, to teach boys the art of \"parsing\"; Egyptians generally\\nconfine themselves in Al-Sarf to the Izzi, and the Lamiyat al-Af\\'al of\\nthe grammarian Ibn Malik.\\n[FN#27] First, the well-known \"Ajrumiyah\" (printed by M. Vaucelle), and\\nits commentary, Al-Kafrawi. Thirdly, the Alfiyah (Thousand Distichs) of\\nIbn Malik, written in verse for mnemonic purposes, but thereby rendered\\nso difficult as to require the lengthy commentary of Al-Ashmumi. The\\nfifth is the well-known work called the Katr al-Nida (the Dew Drop),\\ncelebrated from Cairo to Kabul; and last of all the \"Azhari.\"\\n[FN#28] I know little of the Hanafi school; but the name of the\\nfollowing popular works were given to me by men upon whose learning I\\ncould depend. The book first read is the text, called Marah al-Falah,\\ncontaining about twenty pages, and its commentary, which is about six\\ntimes longer. Then comes the Matn al-Kanz, a brief text of from 35 to\\n40 pages, followed by three long Sharh. The shortest of these,\\n\"Al-Tai,\" contains 500 pages; the next, \"Mulla Miskin,\" at least 900;\\nand the \"Sharh Ayni\" nearly 2000. To these succeeds the Text\\n\"Al-Durar,\" the work of the celebrated Khusraw, (200 pages), with a\\nlarge commentary by the same author; and last is the Matn Tanwir\\nAl-Absar, containing about 500 pages, and its Sharh, a work upwards of\\nfour times the size. Many of these books may be found-especially when\\nthe MS. is an old one-with Hashiyah, or marginal notes, but most men\\nwrite them for themselves, so that there is no generally used\\ncollection. The above-mentioned are the works containing a full course\\nof theological study; it is rare, however, to find a man who reads\\nbeyond the \"Al-Kanz,\" with the shortest of its commentaries, the\\n\"Al-Tai.\"\\n[FN#29] He begins with a little text called, after the name of its\\nauthor, Abu Shuja\\'a of Isfahan, and proceeds to its commentary, a book\\nof about 250 pages, by Ibn Kasim of Ghazzah (Gaza). There is another\\nSharh, neatly four times larger than this, \"Al-Khatib\"; it is seldom\\nread. Then comes Al-Tahrir, the work of Zakariya al-Ansari,-a\\ncelebrated divine buried in the Mosque of Al-Shafe\\'i,-and its\\ncommentary by the same author, a goodly MS. of 600 pages. Most students\\nhere cry: \"Enough!\" The ambitious pass on to Al-Minhaj and its\\ncommentary, (1600 pages). Nor need they stop at this point. A man may\\naddle his brains over Moslem theology, as upon Aristotle\\'s schoolmen,\\ntill his eyesight fails him-both subjects are all but interminable.\\n[FN#30] The three best known are the Arbain al-Nawawi, and the\\nSahihayn-\"the two (universally acknowledged to be) trustworthy,\"-by\\nAl-Muslim and Al-Bokhari, celebrated divines. The others are Al-Jami\\'\\nal-Saghir, \"the smaller collection,\" so called to distinguish it from a\\nrarer book, Al-Jami\\' al-Kabir, the \"greater collection\"; both are the\\nwork of Al-Siyuti. The full course concludes with Al-Shifa, Shamail,\\nand the labours of Kazi Ayyaz.\\n[FN#31] Two Tafsirs are known all over the modern world. The smaller\\none is called Jalalani (\"the two Jalals,\" i.e. the joint work of Jalal\\nal-Siyuti and Jalal al-Mahalli), and fills two stout volumes octavo.\\nThe larger is the Exposition of Al-Bayzawi, which is supposed to\\ncontain the whole subject. Some few divines read Al-Khazin.\\n[FN#32] To conclude the list of Moslem studies, not purely religious.\\nAl-Mantik (or logic) is little valued; it is read when judged\\nadvisable, after Al-Nahw, from which it flows, and before Ma\\'ani Bayan\\n(rhetoric) to which it leads. In Egypt, students are generally directed\\nto fortify their memories, and give themselves a logical turn of mind,\\nby application to Al-Jabr (algebra). The only logical works known are\\nthe Isaghuji (the [Greek text] of Porphyry), Al-Shamsiyah, the book\\nAl-Sullam, with its Sharh Al-Akhzari, and, lastly, Kazi Mir. Equally\\nneglected are the Tawarikh (history) and the Hikmat (or philosophy),\\nonce so ardently cultivated by Moslem savans; indeed, it is now all but\\nimpossible to get books upon these subjects. For upwards of six weeks,\\nI ransacked the stalls and the bazar, in order to find some one of the\\nmultitudinous annals of Al-Hijaz, without seeing for sale anything but\\nthe fourth volume of a large biographical work called al-Akd al-Samin\\nfi Tarikh al-Balad al-Amin.\\nThe \\'Ilm al-\\'Aruz, or Prosody, is not among the Arabs, as with us, a\\nchapter hung on to the tail of grammar. It is a long and difficult\\nstudy, prosecuted only by those who wish to distinguish themselves in\\n\"Arabiyat,\"-the poetry and the eloquence of the ancient and modern\\nArabs. The poems generally studied, with the aid of commentaries, which\\nimpress every verse upon the memory, are the Burdah and the Hamziyah,\\nwell-known odes by Mohammed of Abusir. They abound in obsolete words,\\nand are useful at funerals, as on other solemn occasions. The Banat\\nSu\\'adi, by Ka\\'ab al-Ahbar (or Akhbar), a companion of the Apostle, and\\nthe Diwan \\'Umar ibn Fariz, a celebrated mystic, are also learned\\ncompositions. Few attempt the bulky volume of Al-Mutanabbi-though many\\nplace it open upon the sofa,-fewer still the tenebrous compositions of\\nAl-Hariri; nor do the modern Egyptians admire those fragments of\\nancient Arab poets, which seem so sweetly simple to the European ear.\\nThe change of faith has altered the national taste to such an extent,\\nthat the decent bard must now sing of woman in the masculine gender.\\nFor which reason, a host of modern poetasters can attract the public\\near, which is deaf to the voices of the \"Golden Song.\"\\nIn the exact sciences, the Egyptian Moslems, a backward race according\\nto European estimation, are far superior to the Persians and the\\nMoslems of India. Some of them become tolerable arithmeticians, though\\nvery inferior to the Coptic Christians; they have good and simple\\ntreatises on algebra, and still display some of their ancestors\\'\\nfacility in the acquisition of geometry. The \\'Ilm al-Mikat, or\\n\"Calendar-calculating,\" was at one time publicly taught in the Azhar;\\nthe printing-press has doomed that study to death.\\nThe natural sciences find but scant favour on the banks of the Nile.\\nAstronomy is still astrology, geography a heap of names, and natural\\nhistory a mass of fables. Alchemy, geomancy, and summoning of fiends,\\nare pet pursuits; but the former has so bad a name, that even amongst\\nfriends it is always alluded to as \\'Ilm al-Kaf,-the \"science of K,\" so\\ncalled from the initial letter of the word \"Kimiya.\" Of the state of\\ntherapeutics I have already treated at length.\\nAided by the finest of ears, and flexible organs of articulation, the\\nEgyptian appears to possess many of the elements of a good linguist.\\nThe stranger wonders to hear a Cairene donkey-boy shouting sentences in\\nthree or four European dialects, with a pronunciation as pure as his\\nown. How far this people succeed in higher branches of language, my\\nscanty experience does not enable me to determine. But even for\\nstudents of Arabic, nothing can be more imperfect than those useful\\nimplements, Vocabularies and Dictionaries. The Cairenes have, it is\\ntrue, the Kamus of Fayruzabadi, but it has never been printed in Egypt;\\nit is therefore rare, and when found, lost pages and clerical errors\\ncombined with the intrinsic difficulty of the style, exemplify the\\nsaying of Golius, that the most learned Orientalist must act the part\\nof a diviner, before he can perform that of interpreter. They have\\nanother Lexicon, the Sihah, and an abbreviation of the same, the Sihah\\nal-Saghir (or the lesser), both of them liable to the same objections\\nas the Kamus. For the benefit of the numerous students of Turkish and\\nPersian, short grammars and vocabularies have been printed at a cheap\\nprice, but the former are upon the model of Arabic, a language\\nessentially different in formation, and the latter are mere strings of\\nwords.\\nAs a specimen of the state of periodical literature, I may quote the\\nhistory of the \"Bulak Independent,\" as Europeans facetiously call it.\\nWhen Mohammed Ali, determining to have an \"organ,\" directed an officer\\nto be editor of a weekly paper, the officer replied, that no one would\\nread it, and consequently that no one would pay for it. The Pasha\\nremedied this by an order that a subscription should be struck off from\\nthe pay of all employes, European and Egyptian, whose salary amounted\\nto a certain sum. Upon which the editor accepted the task, but being\\npaid before his work was published, he of course never supplied his\\nsubscribers with their copies.\\n[FN#33] Would not a superficial, hasty, and somewhat prejudiced\\nEgyptian or Persian say exactly the same thing about the systems of\\nChrist Church and Trinity College?\\n[FN#34] And when the man of the world, as sometimes happens, professes\\nto see no difference in the forms of faith, or whispers that his\\nresidence in Europe has made him friendly to the Christian religion,\\nyou will be justified in concluding his opinions to be latitudinarian.\\n[FN#35] I know only one class in Egypt favourable to the English,-the\\ndonkey boys,-and they found our claim to the possession of the country\\nupon a base scarcely admissible by those skilled in casuistry, namely,\\nthat we hire more asses than any other nation.\\n[FN#36] The story is, that Mohammed Ali used to offer his flocks of\\nforeigners their choice of two professions,-\"destruction,\" that is to\\nsay, physic, or \"instruction.\"\\n[FN#37] Of this instances abound. Lately an order was issued to tax the\\nvillages of the Badawin settled upon the edge of the Western desert,\\nwho, even in Mohammed Ali\\'s time, were allowed to live free of\\nassessment. The Aulad \\'Ali, inhabitants of a little village near the\\nPyramids, refused to pay, and turned out with their matchlocks, defying\\nthe Pasha. The government then insisted upon their leaving their\\nhouses, and living under hair-cloth like Badawin, since they claimed\\nthe privileges of Badawin. The sturdy fellows at once pitched their\\ntents, and when I returned to Cairo (in December, 1853), they had\\ndeserted their village. I could offer a score of such cases, proving\\nthe present debased condition of Egypt.\\n[FN#38] At Constantinople the French were the first to break through\\nthe shameful degradation to which the ambassadors of infidel powers\\nwere bribed, by 300 or 400 rations a day, to submit. M. de Saint Priest\\nrefused to give up his sword. General Sebastiani insisted upon wearing\\nhis military boots; and the Republican Aubert Dubajet rejected the\\ndinner, and the rich dress, with which \"the naked and hungry barbarian\\nwho ventured to rub his brow upon the Sublime Porte,\" was fed and\\nclothed before being admitted to the presence, saying that the\\nambassadors of France wanted neither this nor that. At Cairo, M.\\nSabatier, the French Consul-general, has had the merit of doing away\\nwith some customs prejudicial to the dignity of his nation. The next\\nEnglish envoy will, if anxious so to distinguish himself, have an\\nexcellent opportunity. It is usual, after the first audience, for the\\nPasha to send, in token of honour, a sorry steed to the new comer. This\\ncustom is a mere relic of the days when Mohammed the Second threatened\\nto stable his charger in St. Peter\\'s, and when a ride through the\\nstreets of Cairo exposed the Inspector-general Tott, and his suite, to\\nlapidation and an \"avanie.\" To send a good horse is to imply\\ndegradation, but to offer a bad one is a positive insult.\\n[FN#39] As this canal has become a question of national interest, its\\nadvisability is surrounded with all the circumstance of unsupported\\nassertion and bold denial. The English want a railroad, which would\\nconfine the use of Egypt to themselves. The French desire a canal that\\nwould admit the hardy cruisers of the Mediterranean into the Red Sea.\\nThe cosmopolite will hope that both projects may be carried out. Even\\nin the seventh century Omar forbade Amru to cut the Isthmus of Suez for\\nfear of opening Arabia to Christian vessels. As regards the feasibility\\nof the ship-canal, I heard M. Linant de Bellefonds-the best authority\\nupon all such subjects in Egypt-expressly assert, after levelling and\\nsurveying the line, that he should have no difficulty in making it. The\\ncanal is now a fact. As late as April, 1864, Lord Palmerston informed\\nthe House of Commons that labourers might be more usefully employed in\\ncultivating cotton than in \"digging a canal through a sandy desert, and\\nin making two harbours in deep mud and shallow water.\" It is, however,\\nunderstood that the Premier was the only one of his Cabinet who took\\nthis view. Mr. Robert Stephenson, C.E., certainly regretted before his\\ndeath the opinion which he had been induced to express by desire.\\n[FN#40] There are at present about eighteen influential Shaykhs at\\nCairo, too fanatic to listen to reason. These it would be necessary to\\nbanish. Good information about what goes on in each Mosque, especially\\non Fridays, when the priests preach to the people, and a guard of\\nhonour placed at the gates of the Kazi, the three Muftis, and the\\nShaykh of the Azhar, are simple precautions sufficient to keep the\\nOlema in order.\\n[FN#41] These Rakaiz Al-\\'Usab, as they are called, are the most\\ninfluential part of the immense mass of dark intrigue which Cairo, like\\nmost Oriental cities, conceals beneath the light surface. They\\ngenerally appear in the ostensible state of barbers and dyers.\\nSecretly, they preside over their different factions, and form a kind\\nof small Vehm. The French used to pay these men, but Napoleon,\\ndetecting them in stirring up the people, whilst appearing to maintain\\npublic tranquillity, shot eighteen or twenty (about half their number),\\nand thereby improved the conduct of the rest. They are to be managed,\\nas Sir Charles Napier governed Sind,-by keeping a watchful eye upon\\nthem, a free administration of military law, disarming the population,\\nand forbidding large bodies of men to assemble.\\n</p>\\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Chapter_VII._PREPARATIONS_TO_QUIT_CAIRO.\">Chapter VII.

PREPARATIONS TO QUIT CAIRO.\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\\n<p>AT length the slow \"month of blessings\" passed away. We rejoiced like\\nRomans finishing their Quaresima, when a salvo of artillery from the\\ncitadel announced the end of our Lenten woes. On the last day of\\nRamazan all gave alms to the poor, at the rate of a piastre and a half\\nfor each member of the household-slave, servant, and master. The next\\nday, first of the three composing the Bayram or Id[FN#1] (the Lesser\\nFestival), we arose before dawn, performed our ablutions, and repaired\\nto the Mosque, to recite the peculiar prayer of the season, and to hear\\nthe sermon which bade us be \"merry and wise.\" After which we ate and\\ndrank heartily; then, with pipes and tobacco-pouches in hand, we\\nsauntered out to enjoy the contemplation of smiling faces and street\\nscenery.\\n</p><p>The favourite resort on this occasion is the large cemetery beyond the\\nBab al-Nasr[FN#2]-that stern, old, massive gateway which opens upon the\\nSuez road. There we found a scene of jollity. Tents and ambulant\\ncoffee-houses were full of men equipped in their-anglice\\n</p><p>[p.116]-\"Sunday best,\" listening to singers and musicians, smoking,\\nchatting, and looking at jugglers, buffoons, snake-charmers,\\nDarwayshes, ape-leaders, and dancing boys habited in women\\'s attire.\\nEating-stalls and lollipop-shops, booths full of playthings, and sheds\\nfor lemonade and syrups, lined the roads, and disputed with swings and\\nmerry-go-rounds the regards of the little Moslems and Moslemahs. The\\nchief item of the crowd, fair Cairenes, carried in their hands huge\\npalm branches, intending to ornament therewith the tombs of parents and\\nfriends. Yet, even on this solemn occasion, there is, they say, not a\\nlittle flirtation and love-making; parties of policemen are posted,\\nwith orders to interrupt all such irregularities, with a long cane; but\\ntheir vigilance is notoriously unequal to the task. I could not help\\nobserving that frequent pairs, doubtless cousins or other relations,\\nwandered to unusual distances among the sand-hills, and that sometimes\\nthe confusion of a distant bastinado struck the ear. These trifles did\\nnot, however, by any means interfere with the general joy. Every one\\nwore something new; most people were in the fresh suits of finery\\nintended to last through the year; and so strong is personal vanity in\\nthe breasts of Orientals, men and women, young and old, that from Cairo\\nto Calcutta it would be difficult to find a sad heart under a handsome\\ncoat. The men swaggered, the women minced their steps, rolled their\\neyes, and were eternally arranging, and coquetting with their\\nhead-veils. The little boys strutting about foully abused any one of\\ntheir number who might have a richer suit than his neighbours. And the\\nlittle girls ogled every one in the ecstacy of conceit, and glanced\\ncontemptuously at other little girls their rivals.\\n</p><p>Weary of the country, the Haji and I wandered about the city, paying\\nvisits, which at this time are like new-year calls in continental\\nEurope. I can describe the\\n</p><p><br />\\n[p.117]operation of calling in Egypt only as the discussion of pipes\\nand coffee in one place, and of coffee and pipes in another. But on\\nthis occasion, whenever we meet a friend we throw ourselves upon each\\nother\\'s breast, placing right arms over left shoulders, and vice versa,\\nsqueezing like wrestlers, with intermittent hugs, then laying cheek to\\ncheek delicately, at the same time making the loud noise of many kisses\\nin the air.[FN#3] The compliment of the season is, \"Kull\\'am antum bil\\nkhayr\"-\"Every year may you be well!\"-in fact, our \"Many happy returns\\nof the day!\" After this come abundant good wishes, and kindly\\nprophecies; and from a \"religious person\" a blessing, and a short\\nprayer. To complete the resemblance between a Moslem and a Christian\\nfestival, we have dishes of the day, fish, Shurayk, the cross-bun, and\\na peculiarly indigestible cake, called in Egypt Kahk,[FN#4] the\\nplum-pudding of Al-Islam.\\n</p><p>This year\\'s Id was made gloomy, comparatively speaking, by the state of\\npolitics. Report of war with Russia, with France, with England, who was\\ngoing to land three million men at Suez, and with Infideldom in\\ngeneral, rang through Egypt, and the city of Mars[FN#5] became\\nunusually martial. The government armouries, arsenals, and\\nmanufactories, were crowded with kidnapped workmen. Those who purposed\\na pilgrimage feared forcible detention. Wherever men gathered together,\\nin the Mosques, for instance, or the coffee-houses, the police\\n</p><p>[p.118]closed the doors, and made forcible capture of the able-bodied.\\nThis proceeding, almost as barbarous as our impressment law, filled the\\nmain streets with detachments of squalid-looking wretches, marching to\\nbe made soldiers, with collars round their necks and irons on their\\nwrists. The dismal impression of the scene was deepened by crowds of\\nwomen, who, habited in mourning, and scattering dust and mud over their\\nrent garments, followed their sons, brothers, and husbands, with cries\\nand shrieks. The death-wail is a peculiar way of cheering on the\\npatriot departing pro patria mori, and the origin of the custom is\\ncharacteristic of the people. The principal public amusements allowed\\nto Oriental women are those that come under the general name of\\n\"Fantasia,\"-birth-feasts, marriage festivals, and funerals. And the\\nearly campaigns of Mohammed Ali\\'s family in Syria, and Al-Hijaz having,\\nin many cases, deprived the bereaved of their sex-right to \"keen\" for\\nthe dead, they have now determined not to waste the opportunity, but to\\nrevel in the luxury of woe at the live man\\'s wake.[FN#6]\\n</p><p>Another cloud hung over Cairo. Rumours of conspiracy were afloat. The\\nJews and Christians,-here as ready to take alarm as the English in\\nItaly,-trembled at the fancied preparations for insurrection, massacre,\\nand plunder. And even the Moslems whispered that some hundred\\ndesperadoes had resolved to fire the city, beginning with the bankers\\'\\nquarter, and to spoil the wealthy Egyptians. Of course H.H. Abbas Pasha\\nwas absent at the time, and, even had he been at Cairo, his presence\\nwould have been of little use: the ruler can do nothing\\n</p><p>[p.119]towards restoring confidence to a panic-stricken Oriental nation.\\n</p><p>At the end of the Id, as a counter-irritant to political excitement,\\nthe police magistrates began to bully the people. There is a standing\\norder in the chief cities of Egypt, that all who stir abroad after dark\\nwithout a lantern shall pass the night in the station-house.[FN#7] But\\nat Cairo, in certain quarters, the Azbakiyah[FN#8] for instance, a\\nlittle laxity is usually allowed. Before I left the capital the licence\\nwas withdrawn, and the sudden strictness caused many ludicrous scenes.\\n</p><p>If by chance you (clad in Oriental garb) had sent on your lantern to a\\nfriend\\'s house by your servant, and had leisurely followed it five\\nminutes after the hour of eight, you were sure to be met, stopped,\\ncollared, questioned, and captured by the patrol. You probably punched\\nthree or four of them, but found the dozen too strong for you. Held\\ntightly by the sleeves, skirts, and collar of your wide outer garment,\\nyou were hurried away on a plane of about nine inches above the ground,\\nyour feet mostly treading the air. You were dragged along with a\\nrapidity which scarcely permitted you to answer strings of questions\\nconcerning your name, nation, dwelling, faith, profession, and self in\\ngeneral,-especially concerning the present state of your purse. If you\\nlent an ear to the voice of the charmer that began by asking a crown to\\nrelease you, and gradually came down to two-pence half-penny, you fell\\ninto a simple trap; the butt-end of a musket applied a posteriori,\\nimmediately after the transfer of property, convicted you of wilful\\nwaste. But if, more sensibly, you pretended to have forgotten your\\npurse, you\\n</p><p>[p.120]were reviled, and dragged with increased violence of shaking to\\nthe office of the Zabit, or police magistrate. You were spun through\\nthe large archway leading to the court, every fellow in uniform giving\\nyou, as you passed, a Kafa, \"cuff,\" on the back of the neck. Despite\\nyour rage, you were forced up the stairs to a long gallery full of\\npeople in a predicament like your own. Again your name, nation,-I\\nsuppose you to be masquerading,-offence, and other particulars were\\nasked, and carefully noted in a folio by a ferocious-looking clerk. If\\nyou knew no better, you were summarily thrust into the Hasil or\\ncondemned cell, to pass the night with pickpockets or ruffians,\\npell-mell. But if an adept in such matters, you insisted upon being\\nconducted before the \"Pasha of the Night,\" and, the clerk fearing to\\nrefuse, you were hurried to the great man\\'s office, hoping for justice,\\nand dealing out ideal vengeance to your captors,-the patrol. Here you\\nfound the dignitary sitting with pen, ink, and paper before him, and\\npipe and coffee-cup in hand, upon a wide Diwan of dingy chintz, in a\\nlarge dimly-lit room, with two guards by his side, and a semi-circle of\\nrecent seizures vociferating before him. When your turn came, you were\\ncarefully collared, and led up to the presence, as if even at that\\nawful moment you were mutinously and murderously disposed. The Pasha,\\nlooking at you with a vicious sneer, turned up his nose, ejaculated\\n\"\\'Ajami,\" and prescribed the bastinado. You observed that the mere fact\\nof being a Persian did not give mankind a right to capture, imprison,\\nand punish you; you declared moreover that you were no Persian, but an\\nIndian under British protection. The Pasha, a man accustomed to\\nobedience, then stared at you, to frighten you, and you, we will\\nsuppose, stared at him, till, with an oath, he turned to the patrol,\\nand asked them your offence. They all simultaneously swore-by\\nAllah!-that you had been found without a lantern, dead-drunk, beating\\nrespectable people,\\n</p><p>[p.121]breaking into houses, invading and robbing harims. You openly\\ntold the Pasha that they were eating abominations; upon which he\\ndirected one of his guards to smell your breath,-the charge of\\ndrunkenness being tangible. The fellow, a comrade of your capturers,\\nadvanced his nose to your lips; as might be expected, cried \"Kikh,\"\\ncontorted his countenance, and answered, by the beard of\\n\"Effendina[FN#9]\" that he perceived a pestilent odour of distilled\\nwaters. This announcement probably elicited a grim grin from the \"Pasha\\nof the Night,\" who loves Cura\\xef\\xbf\\xbdoa, and who is not indifferent to the\\ncharms of Cognac. Then by his favour, for you improved the occasion,\\nyou were allowed to spend the hours of darkness on a wooden bench, in\\nthe adjacent long gallery, together with certain little parasites, for\\nwhich polite language has no name.[FN#10] In the morning the janissary\\nof your Consulate was sent for: he came, and claimed you; you were led\\noff criminally; again you gave your name and address, and if your\\noffence was merely sending on your lantern, you were dismissed with\\nadvice to be more careful in future. And assuredly your first step was\\ntowards the Hammam.\\n</p><p>But if, on the other hand, you had declared yourself a European, you\\nwould either have been dismissed at once, or sent to your Consul, who\\nis here judge, jury, and jailor. Egyptian authority has of late years\\nlost half its prestige. When Mr. Lane first settled at Cairo, all\\nEuropeans accused of aggression against Moslems were, he tells us,\\nsurrendered to the Turkish magistrates. Now, the native powers have no\\njurisdiction over strangers,\\n</p><p>[p.122]nor can the police enter their houses. If the West would raise\\nthe character of its Eastern co-religionists, it will be forced to push\\nthe system a point further, and to allow all bona-fide Christian\\nsubjects to register their names at the different Consulates whose\\nprotection they might prefer. This is what Russia has so \"unwarrantably\\nand outrageously\" attempted. We confine ourselves to a lesser\\ninjustice, which deprives Eastern states of their right as independent\\nPowers to arrest, and to judge foreigners, who for interest or\\nconvenience settle in their dominions. But we still shudder at the\\nright of arrogating any such claim over the born lieges of Oriental\\nPowers. What, however, would be the result were Great Britain to\\nauthorise her sons resident at Paris, or Florence, to refuse attendance\\nat a French or an Italian court of justice, and to demand that the\\npolice should never force the doors of an English subject? I commend\\nthis consideration to all those who \"stickle for abstract rights\" when\\nthe interest and progress of others are concerned, and who become\\nsomewhat latitudinarian and concrete in cases where their own welfare\\nand aggrandisement are at stake.\\n</p><p>Besides patients, I made some pleasant acquaintances at Cairo. Antun\\nZananire, a young Syrian of considerable attainments as a linguist,\\npaid me the compliment of permitting me to see the fair face of his\\n\"Harim.\" Mr. Hatchadur Nury, an Armenian gentleman, well known in\\nBombay, amongst other acts of kindness, introduced me to one of his\\ncompatriots, Khwajah Yusuf, whose advice was most useful to me. The\\nKhwajah had wandered far and wide, picking up everywhere some scrap of\\nstrange knowledge, and his history was a romance. Expelled from Cairo\\nfor a youthful peccadillo, he started upon his travels, qualified\\nhimself for sanctity at Meccah and Al-Madinah, became a religious\\nbeggar at Baghdad, studied French at Paris, and finally settled\\n</p><p>[p.123]down as a professor of languages,[FN#11] under an amnesty, at\\nCairo. In his house I saw an Armenian marriage. The occasion was\\nmemorable: after the gloom and sameness of Moslem society, nothing\\ncould be more gladdening than the unveiled face of a pretty woman. Some\\nof the guests were undeniably charming brunettes, with the blackest\\npossible locks, and the brightest conceivable eyes. Only one pretty\\ngirl wore the national costume;[FN#12] yet they all smoked chibuks and\\nsat upon the Diwans, and, as they entered the room, they kissed with a\\nsweet simplicity the hands of the priest, and of the other old\\ngentlemen present.\\n</p><p><br />\\nAmong the number of my acquaintances was a Meccan boy, Mohammed\\nal-Basyuni, from whom I bought the pilgrim-garb called \"Al-Ihram\" and\\nthe Kafan or shroud, with which the Moslem usually starts upon such a\\njourney as mine. He, being in his way homewards after a visit to\\nConstantinople, was most anxious to accompany me in the character of a\\n\"companion.\" But he had travelled too much to suit me; he had visited\\nIndia, he had seen Englishmen, and he had lived with the \"Nawab Balu\"\\nof Surat. Moreover, he showed signs of over-wisdom. He had been a\\nregular visitor, till I cured one of his friends of an ophthalmia,\\nafter which\\n</p><p>[p.124]he gave me his address at Meccah, and was seen no more. Haji\\nWali described him and his party to be \"Nas jarrar\" (extractors), and\\ncertainly he had not misjudged them. But the sequel will prove how der\\nMensch denkt und Gott lenkt; and as the boy, Mohammed, eventually did\\nbecome my companion throughout the Pilgrimage, I will place him before\\nthe reader as summarily as possible.\\n</p><p>He is a beardless youth, of about eighteen, chocolate-brown, with high\\nfeatures, and a bold profile; his bony and decided Meccan cast of face\\nis lit up by the peculiar Egyptian eye, which seems to descend from\\ngeneration to generation.[FN#13] His figure is short and broad, with a\\ntendency to be obese, the result of a strong stomach and the power of\\nsleeping at discretion. He can read a little, write his name, and is\\nuncommonly clever at a bargain. Meccah had taught him to speak\\nexcellent Arabic, to understand the literary dialect, to be eloquent in\\nabuse, and to be profound at Prayer and Pilgrimage. Constantinople had\\ngiven him a taste for Anacreontic singing, and female society of the\\nquestionable kind, a love of strong waters,-the hypocrite looked\\npositively scandalised when I first suggested the subject,-and an\\noff-hand latitudinarian mode of dealing with serious subjects in\\ngeneral. I found him to be the youngest son of a widow, whose doting\\nfondness had moulded his disposition; he was selfish and affectionate,\\nas spoiled children usually are, volatile, easily offended and as\\neasily pacified (the Oriental), coveting other men\\'s goods, and profuse\\nof his own (the Arab), with a matchless intrepidity of countenance (the\\ntraveller), brazen lunged, not more than half brave, exceedingly\\nastute, with an acute sense of honour, especially where his\\n</p><p>[p.125]relations were concerned (the individual). I have seen him in a\\nfit of fury because some one cursed his father; and he and I nearly\\nparted because on one occasion I applied to him an epithet which,\\netymologically considered, might be exceedingly insulting to a\\nhigh-minded brother, but which in popular parlance signifies nothing.\\nThis \"point d\\'honneur\" was the boy Mohammed\\'s strong point.\\n</p><p>During the Ramazan I laid in my stores for the journey. These consisted\\nof tea, coffee, loaf-sugar, rice, dates, biscuit, oil, vinegar,\\ntobacco, lanterns, and cooking pots, a small bell-shaped tent, costing\\ntwelve shillings, and three water-skins for the Desert.[FN#14] The\\nprovisions were placed in a \"Kafas\" or hamper artistically made of palm\\nsticks, and in a huge Sahharah, or wooden box, about three feet each\\nway, covered with leather or skin, and provided with a small lid\\nfitting into the top.[FN#15] The\\n</p><p>[p.126]former, together with my green box containing medicines, and\\nsaddle-bags full of clothes, hung on one side of the camel, a\\ncounterpoise to the big Sahharah on the other flank; the Badawin, like\\nmuleteers, always requiring a balance of weight. On the top of the load\\nwas placed transversely a Shibriyah or cot, on which Shaykh Nur\\nsquatted like a large crow. This worthy had strutted out into the\\nstreets armed with a pair of horse-pistols and a sword almost as long\\nas himself. No sooner did the mischievous boys of Cairo-they are as bad\\nas the gamins of Paris and London-catch sight of him than they began to\\nscream with laughter at the sight of the \"Hindi (Indian) in arms,\"\\ntill, like a vagrant owl pursued by a flight of larks, he ran back into\\nthe Caravanserai.\\n</p><p>Having spent all my ready money at Cairo, I was obliged to renew the\\nsupply. My native acquaintances advised me to take at least eighty\\npounds sterling, and considering the expense of outfit for Desert\\ntravelling, the sum did not appear excessive. I should have found some\\ndifficulty in raising the money had it not been for the kindness of a\\nfriend at Alexandria, John Thurburn, now, I regret to say, no more, and\\nMr. Sam Shepheard, then of Shepheard\\'s Hotel, Cairo, presently a landed\\nproprietor near Rugby, and now also gone. My Indians scrutinised the\\ndiminutive square of paper[FN#16]-the\\n</p><p>[p.127]letter of credit-as a raven may sometimes be seen peering, with\\nhead askance, into the interior of a suspected marrow-bone. \"Can this\\nbe a bona-fide draft?\" they mentally inquired. And finally they\\noffered, politely, to write to England for me, to draw the money, and\\nto forward it in a sealed bag directed \"Al-Madinah.\" I need scarcely\\nsay that such a style of transmission would, in the case of precious\\nmetals, have left no possible chance of its safe arrival. When the\\ndifficulty was overcome, I bought fifty pounds\\' worth of German dollars\\n(Maria Theresas), and invested the rest in English and Turkish\\nsovereigns.[FN#17] The gold I myself carried; part of the silver I\\nsewed up in Shaykh Nur\\'s leather waistbelt, and part was packed in the\\nboxes, for this reason,-when Badawin begin plundering a respectable\\nman, if they find a certain amount of ready money in his baggage, they\\ndo not search his person. If they find none they proceed to a bodily\\ninspection, and if his waist-belt be empty they are rather disposed to\\nrip open his stomach, in the belief that he must have some peculiarly\\ningenious way of secreting valuables. Having passed through this\\ntrouble I immediately fell into another. My hardly-earned Alexandrian\\npassport required a double visa, one at the Police office, the other at\\nthe Consul\\'s. After returning to Egypt, I found it was the practice of\\ntravellers\\n</p><p>[p.128]who required any civility from Dr. Walne, then the English\\nofficial at Cairo, to enter the \"Presence\" furnished with an order from\\nthe Foreign Office.\\n</p><p>I had neglected the precaution, and had ample reason to regret having\\ndone so. Failing at the British Consulate, and unwilling to leave Cairo\\nwithout being \"en regle,\"-the Egyptians warned me that Suez was a place\\nof obstacles to pilgrims,[FN#18]-I was obliged to look elsewhere for\\nprotection. My friend Haji Wali was the first consulted; after a long\\ndiscussion he offered to take me to his Consul, the Persian, and to\\nfind out for what sum I could become a temporary subject of the Shah.\\nWe went to the sign of the \"Lion and the Sun,\" and we found the\\ndragoman,[FN#19] a subtle Syrian Christian, who,\\n</p><p>[p.129]after a rigid inquiry into the state of my purse (my country was\\nno consideration at all[FN#20]), introduced me to the Great Man. I have\\ndescribed this personage once already, and he merits not a second\\nnotice. The interview was truly ludicrous. He treated us with exceeding\\nhauteur, motioned me to sit almost out of hearing, and after rolling\\nhis head in profound silence for nearly a quarter of an hour,\\nvouchsafed the information that though my father might be a Shirazi,\\nand my mother an Afghan, he had not the honour of my acquaintance. His\\ncompanion, a large old Persian with Polyphemean eyebrows and a mulberry\\nbeard, put some gruff and discouraging questions. I quoted the verses\\n</p><p>\"He is a man who benefits his fellow men,\\nNot he who says \\xef\\xbf\\xbdwhy?\\' and \\xef\\xbf\\xbdwherefore?\\' and \\xef\\xbf\\xbdhow much?\\'\"\\n</p><p>upon which an imperious wave of the arm directed me to return to the\\ndragoman, who had the effrontery to ask me four pounds sterling for a\\nPersian passport. I offered one. He derided my offer, and I went away\\nperplexed. On my return to Cairo some months afterwards, he sent to say\\nthat had he known me as an Englishman, I should have had the document\\ngratis,-a civility for which he was duly thanked.\\n</p><p>At last my Shaykh Mohammed hit upon the plan. \"Thou art,\" said he, \"an\\nAfghan; I will fetch hither the principal of the Afghan college at the\\nAzhar, and he, if\\n</p><p>[p.130]thou make it worth his while,\" (this in a whisper) \"will be thy\\nfriend.\" The case was looking desperate; my preceptor was urged to lose\\nno time.\\n</p><p>Presently Shaykh Mohammed returned in company with the principal, a\\nlittle, thin, ragged-bearded, one-eyed, hare-lipped divine, dressed in\\nvery dirty clothes, of nondescript cut. Born at Maskat of Afghan\\nparents, and brought up at Meccah, he was a kind of cosmopolite,\\nspeaking five languages fluently, and full of reminiscences of toil and\\ntravel. He refused pipes and coffee, professing to be ascetically\\ndisposed: but he ate more than half my dinner, to reassure me, I\\npresume, should I have been fearful that abstinence might injure his\\nhealth. We then chatted in sundry tongues. I offered certain presents\\nof books, which were rejected (such articles being valueless), and the\\nShaykh Abd al-Wahhab having expressed his satisfaction at my account of\\nmyself, told me to call for him at the Azhar Mosque next Morning.\\n</p><p>Accordingly at six P.M. Shaykh Mohammed and Abdullah Khan,[FN#21]-the\\nlatter equipped in a gigantic sprigged-muslin turband, so as to pass\\nfor a student of theology,-repaired to Al-Azhar. Passing through the\\nopen quadrangle, we entered the large hall which forms the body of the\\nMosque. In the northern wall was a dwarf door, leading by breakneck\\nstairs to a pigeon-hole, the study of the learned Afghan Shaykh. We\\nfound him ensconced behind piles of musty and greasy manuscripts,\\nsurrounded by scholars and scribes, with whom he was cheapening books.\\nHe had not much business to transact; but long before he was ready, the\\nstifling atmosphere drove us out of the study, and we repaired to the\\nhall. Presently the Shaykh joined us, and we all rode on to the\\ncitadel, and waited in a Mosque till the office hour struck. When the\\ndoors were opened we went into the\\n</p><p>[p.131]\"Diwan,\" and sat patiently till the Shaykh found an opportunity\\nof putting in a word. The officials were two in number; one an old\\ninvalid, very thin and sickly-looking, dressed in the Turco-European\\nstyle, whose hand was being severely kissed by a troop of religious\\nbeggars, to whom he had done some small favours; the other was a stout\\nyoung clerk, whose duty it was to engross, and not to have his hand\\nkissed.\\n</p><p>My name and other essentials were required, and no objections were\\noffered, for who holier than the Shaykh Abd al-Wahhab ibn Yunus\\nal-Sulaymani? The clerk filled up a printed paper in the Turkish\\nlanguage, apparent1y borrowed from the European method for spoiling the\\ntraveller; certified me, upon the Shaykh\\'s security, to be one\\nAbdullah, the son of Yusuf (Joseph), originally from Kabul, described\\nmy person, and, in exchange for five piastres, handed me the document.\\nI received it with joy.\\n</p><p>With bows, and benedictions, and many wishes that Allah might make it\\nthe officials\\' fate to become pilgrims, we left the office, and\\nreturned towards Al-Azhar. When we had nearly reached the Mosque,\\nShaykh Mohammed lagged behind, and made the sign. I drew near the\\nAfghan, and asked for his hand. He took the hint, and muttering, \"It is\\nno matter!\"-\"It is not necessary!\"-\"By Allah it is not required!\"\\nextended his fingers, and brought the \"musculus guineorum\" to bear upon\\nthree dollars.\\n</p><p>Poor man! I believe it was his necessity that consented to be paid for\\nthe doing a common act of Moslem charity; he had a wife and children,\\nand the calling of an Alim[FN#22] is no longer worth much in Egypt.\\n</p><p>My departure from Cairo was hastened by an accident. I lost my\\nreputation by a little misfortune that happened in this wise.\\n</p><p>[p.132]At Haji Wali\\'s room in the Caravanserai, I met a Yuzbashi, or\\ncaptain of Albanian Irregulars, who was in Egypt on leave from\\nAl-Hijaz. He was a tall, bony, and broad-shouldered mountaineer, about\\nforty years old, with the large bombe brow, the fierce eyes, thin lips,\\nlean jaws, and peaky chin of his race. His mustachios were enormously\\nlong and tapering, and the rest of his face, like his head, was close\\nshaven. His Fustan[FN#23] was none of the cleanest; nor was the red\\ncap, which he wore rakishly pulled over his frowning forehead, quite\\nfree from stains. Not permitted to carry the favourite pistols, he\\ncontented himself with sticking his right hand in the empty belt, and\\nstalking about the house with a most military mien. Yet he was as\\nlittle of a bully as carpet knight, that same Ali Agha; his body showed\\nmany a grisly scar, and one of his shin bones had been broken by a\\nTurkish bullet, when he was playing tricks on the Albanian hills,-an\\naccident inducing a limp, which he attempted to conceal by a heavy\\nswagger. When he spoke, his voice was affectedly gruff; he had a sad\\nknack of sneering, and I never saw him thoroughly sober.\\n</p><p>Our acquaintance began with a kind of storm, which blew over, and left\\nfine weather. I was showing Haji Wali my pistols with Damascene barrels\\nwhen Ali Agha entered the room. He sat down before me with a grin,\\nwhich said intelligibly enough, \"What business have you with\\nweapons?\"-snatched the arm out of my hand, and began to inspect it as a\\nconnoisseur. Not admiring this procedure, I wrenched it away from him,\\nand, addressing myself to Haji Wali, proceeded quietly with my\\ndissertation. The captain of Irregulars and I then looked at each\\nother. He cocked his cap on one side, in token of excited pugnacity. I\\ntwirled my moustachios to display a kindred emotion. Had he been armed,\\nand in Al-Hijaz,\\n</p><p>[p.133]we should have fought it out at once, for the Arnauts are\\n\"terribili colla pistola,\" as the Italians say, meaning that upon the\\nleast provocation they pull out a horse-pistol, and fire it in the face\\nof friend or foe. Of course, the only way under these circumstances is\\nto anticipate them; but even this desperate prevention seldom saves a\\nstranger, as whenever there is danger, these men go about in pairs. I\\nnever met with a more reckless brood. Upon the line of march Albanian\\ntroops are not allowed ammunition; for otherwise there would be half a\\ndozen duels a day. When they quarrel over their cups, it is the fashion\\nfor each man to draw a pistol, and to place it against his opponent\\'s\\nbreast. The weapons being kept accurately clean, seldom miss fire, and\\nif one combatant draw trigger before the other, he would immediately be\\nshot down by the bystanders.[FN#24] In Egypt these men,-who are used as\\nIrregulars, and are often quartered upon the hapless villagers, when\\nunable or unwilling to pay taxes,-were the terror of the population. On\\nmany occasions they have quarrelled with foreigners, and insulted\\nEuropean women. In Al-Hijaz their recklessness awes even the Badawin.\\nThe townspeople say of them that, \"tripe-sellers, and bath-servants, at\\nStambul, they become Pharaohs (tyrants, ruffians,) in Arabia.\" At\\nJeddah the Arnauts have amused themselves with firing at the English\\nConsul, Mr. Ogilvie, when he walked upon his terrace. And this\\nman-shooting appears a favourite sport with them: at Cairo numerous\\nstories illustrate the sang froid with which they used to knock over\\nthe camel-drivers, if any one dared to ride past their barracks. The\\nAlbanians vaunt their skill in using weapons, and their pretensions\\nimpose upon Arabs as well as Egyptians; yet I have never found them\\nwonderful with any arm\\n</p><p>[p.134](the pistol alone excepted); and our officers, who have visited\\ntheir native hills, speak of them as tolerable but by no means\\nfirst-rate rifle shots.\\n</p><p>The captain of Irregulars being unhappily debarred the pleasure of\\nshooting me, after looking fierce for a time, rose, and walked\\nmajestically out of the room. A day or two afterwards, he called upon\\nme civilly enough, sat down, drank a cup of coffee, smoked a pipe, and\\nbegan to converse. But as he knew about a hundred Arabic words, and I\\nas many Turkish, our conversation was carried on under difficulties.\\nPresently he asked me in a whisper for \"\\'Araki.\"[FN#25] I replied that\\nthere was none in the house, which induced a sneer and an ejaculation\\nsounding like \"Himar,\" (ass,) the slang synonym amongst fast Moslems\\nfor water-drinker. After rising to depart, he seized me waggishly, with\\nan eye to a trial of strength. Thinking that an Indian doctor and a\\ntemperance man would not be very dangerous, he exposed himself to what\\nis professionally termed a \"cross-buttock,\" and had his \"nut\" come in\\ncontact with the stone floor instead of my bed, he might not have drunk\\nfor many a day. The fall had a good effect upon his temper. He jumped\\nup,\\n</p><p>[p.135]patted my head, called for another pipe, and sat down to show me\\nhis wounds, and to boast of his exploits. I could not help remarking a\\nring of English gold, with a bezel of bloodstone, sitting strangely\\nupon his coarse, sun-stained hand. He declared that it had been\\nsnatched by him from a Konsul (Consul) at Jeddah, and he volubly\\nrelated, in a mixture of Albanian, Turkish, and Arabic, the history of\\nhis acquisition. He begged me to supply him with a little poison that\\n\"would not lie,\" for the purpose of quieting a troublesome enemy, and\\nhe carefully stowed away in his pouch five grains of calomel, which I\\ngave him for that laudable purpose. Before taking leave he pressed me\\nstrongly to go and drink with him; I refused to do so during the day,\\nbut, wishing to see how these men sacrifice to Bacchus, promised\\ncompliance that night. About nine o\\'clock, when the Caravanserai was\\nquiet, I took a pipe, and a tobacco-pouch,[FN#26] stuck my dagger in my\\nbelt, and slipped into Ali Agha\\'s room. He was sitting on a bed spread\\nupon the ground: in front of him stood four wax candles (all Orientals\\nhate drinking in any but a bright light), and a tray containing a basin\\nof stuff like soup maigre, a dish of cold stewed meat, and two bowls of\\nSalatah,[FN#27] sliced cucumber, and curds. The \"materials\" peeped out\\nof an iron pot filled with water; one was a long, thin, white-glass\\nflask of \\'Araki, the other a bottle of some strong\\n</p><p>[p.136]perfume. Both were wrapped up in wet rags, the usual\\nrefrigerator.\\n</p><p>Ali Agha welcomed me politely, and seeing me admire the preparations,\\nbade me beware how I suspected an Albanian of not knowing how to drink;\\nhe made me sit by him on the bed, threw his dagger to a handy distance,\\nsignalled me to do the same, and prepared to begin the bout. Taking up\\na little tumbler, in shape like those from which French postilions used\\nto drink la goutte, he inspected it narrowly, wiped out the interior\\nwith his forefinger, filled it to the brim, and offered it to his\\nguest[FN#28] with a bow. I received it with a low salam, swallowed its\\ncontents at once, turned it upside down in proof of fair play, replaced\\nit upon the floor, with a jaunty movement of the arm, somewhat like a\\npugilist delivering a \"rounder,\" bowed again, and requested him to help\\nhimself. The same ceremony followed on his part. Immediately after each\\nglass,-and rapidly the cup went about,-we swallowed a draught of water,\\nand ate a spoonful of the meat or the Salatah in order to cool our\\npalates. Then we re-applied ourselves to our pipes, emitting huge\\npuffs, a sign of being \"fast\" men, and looked facetiously at each\\nother,-drinking being considered by Moslems a funny and pleasant sort\\nof sin.\\n</p><p>The Albanian captain was at least half seas over when we began the\\nbout, yet he continued to fill and to drain without showing the least\\nprogress towards ebriety. I in vain for a time expected the bad-masti\\n(as the Persians call it,) the horse play, and the gross facetiae,\\nwhich generally\\n</p><p>[p.137]accompany southern and eastern tipsiness. Ali Agha, indeed,\\noccasionally took up the bottle of perfume, filled the palm of his\\nright hand, and dashed it in my face: I followed his example, but our\\npleasantries went no further.\\n</p><p>Presently my companion started a grand project, namely, that I should\\nentice the respectable Haji Wali into the room, where we might force\\nhim to drink. The idea was facetious; it was making a Bow-street\\nmagistrate polk at a casino. I started up to fetch the Haji; and when I\\nreturned with him Ali Agha was found in a new stage of \"freshness.\" He\\nhad stuck a green-leaved twig upright in the floor, and had so turned\\nover a gugglet of water, that its contents trickled slowly, in a tiny\\nstream under the verdure; whilst he was sitting before it mentally\\ngazing, with an outward show of grim Quixotic tenderness, upon the\\nshady trees and the cool rills of his fatherland. Possibly he had\\npeopled the place with \"young barbarians at play;\" for verily I thought\\nthat a tear \"which had no business there\" was glistening in his stony\\neye.\\n</p><p>The appearance of Haji Wali suddenly changed the scene. Ali Agha jumped\\nup, seized the visitor by the shoulder, compelled him to sit down, and,\\necstasied by the old man\\'s horror at the scene, filled a tumbler, and\\nwith the usual grotesque grimaces insisted upon its being drunk off.\\nHaji Wali stoutly refused; then Ali Agha put it to his own lips, and\\ndrained it, with a hurt feeling and reproachful aspect. We made our\\nunconvivial friend smoke a few puffs, and then we returned to the\\ncharge. In vain the Haji protested that throughout life he had avoided\\nthe deadly sin; in vain he promised to drink with us to-morrow,-in vain\\nhe quoted the Koran, and alternately coaxed, and threatened us with the\\npolice. We were inexorable. At last the Haji started upon his feet, and\\nrushed away, regardless of any thing but escape,\\n</p><p>[p.138]leaving his Tarbush, his slippers, and his pipe, in the hands of\\nthe enemy. The host did not dare to pursue his recreant guest beyond\\nthe door, but returning he carefully sprinkled the polluting liquid on\\nthe cap, pipe, and shoes, and called the Haji an ass in every tongue he\\nknew.\\n</p><p>Then we applied ourselves to supper, and dispatched the soup, the stew,\\nand the Salatah. A few tumblers and pipes were exhausted to obviate\\nindigestion, when Ali Agha arose majestically, and said that he\\nrequired a troop of dancing girls to gladden his eyes with a ballet.\\n</p><p>I represented that such persons are no longer admitted into\\nCaravanserais.[FN#29] He inquired, with calm ferocity, \"who hath\\nforbidden it?\" I replied \"the Pasha;\" upon which Ali Agha quietly\\nremoved his cap, brushed it with his dexter fore-arm, fitted it on his\\nforehead, raking forwards, twisted his mustachios to the sharp point of\\na single hair, shouldered his pipe, and moved towards the door, vowing\\nthat he would make the Pasha himself come, and dance before us.\\n</p><p>I foresaw a brawl, and felt thankful that my boon companion had\\nforgotten his dagger. Prudence whispered me to return to my room, to\\nbolt the door, and to go to bed, but conscience suggested that it would\\nbe unfair to abandon the Albanian in his present helpless state. I\\nfollowed him into the outer gallery, pulling him, and begging him, as a\\ndespairing wife might urge a drunken husband, to return home. And he,\\nlike the British husband, being greatly irritated by the unjovial\\nadvice, instantly belaboured with his pipe-stick[FN#30] the first person\\n</p><p>[p.139]he met in the gallery, and sent him flying down the stairs with\\nfearful shouts of \"O Egyptians! O ye accursed! O genus of Pharaoh! O\\nrace of dogs! O Egyptians!\"\\n</p><p>He then burst open a door with his shoulder, and reeled into a room\\nwhere two aged dames were placidly reposing by the side of their\\nspouses, who were basket-makers. They immediately awoke, seeing a\\nstranger, and, hearing his foul words, they retorted with a hot volley\\nof vituperation.\\n</p><p>Put to flight by the old women\\'s tongues, Ali Agha, in spite of all my\\nendeavours, reeled down the stairs, and fell upon the sleeping form of\\nthe night porter, whose blood he vowed to drink-the Oriental form of\\nthreatening \"spiflication.\" Happily for the assaulted, the Agha\\'s\\nservant, a sturdy Albanian lad, was lying on a mat in the doorway close\\nby. Roused by the tumult, he jumped up, and found the captain in a\\nstate of fury. Apparently the man was used to the master\\'s mood.\\nWithout delay he told us all to assist, and we lending a helping hand,\\nhalf dragged and half carried the Albanian to his room. Yet even in\\nthis ignoble plight, he shouted with all the force of his lungs the old\\nwar-cry, \"O Egyptians! O race of dogs! I have dishonoured all\\nSikandariyah-all Kahirah-all Suways.[FN#31]\" And in this vaunting frame\\nof mind he was put to bed. No Welsh undergraduate at Oxford, under\\nsimilar circumstances, ever gave more trouble.\\n</p><p>\"You had better start on your pilgrimage at once,\"\\n</p><p>[p.140]said Haji Wali, meeting me the next morning with a \"goguenard\"\\nsmile.\\n</p><p>He was right. Throughout the Caravanserai nothing was talked of for\\nnearly a week but the wickedness of the captain of Albanian Irregulars,\\nand the hypocrisy of the staid Indian doctor. Thus it was, gentle\\nreader, that I lost my reputation of being a \"serious person\" at Cairo.\\nAnd all I have to show for it is the personal experience of an Albanian\\ndrinking-bout.\\n</p><p>I wasted but little time in taking leave of my friends, telling them,\\nby way of precaution, that my destination was Meccah via Jeddah, and\\nfirmly determining, if possible, to make Al-Madinah via Yambu\\'.\\n\"Conceal,\" says the Arab\\'s proverb, \"Thy Tenets, thy Treasure, and thy\\nTravelling.\"\\n</p><p>[FN#1] Festival. It lasts the three first days of Shawwal, the month\\nimmediately following Ramazan, and therefore, among Moslems,\\ncorresponds with our Paschal holidays, which succeed Lent. It is called\\nthe \"Lesser Festival,\" the \"Greater\" being in Zu\\'l Hijjah, the\\npilgrimage-month.\\n[FN#2] In Chap. V. of this Volume, I have mentioned this cemetery as\\nBurckhardt\\'s last resting-place.\\n[FN#3] You are bound also to meet even your enemies in the most\\nfriendly way-for which mortification you afterwards hate them more\\ncordially than before.\\n[FN#4] Persian.\\n[FN#5] With due deference to the many of a different opinion, I believe\\n\"Kahirah\" (corrupted through the Italian into Cairo) to mean, not the\\n\"victorious,\" but the \"City of Kahir,\" or Mars the Planet. It was so\\ncalled because, as Richardson has informed the world, it was founded in\\nA.D. 968 by one Jauhar, a Dalmatian renegade before mentioned, when the\\nwarlike planet was in the ascendant.\\n[FN#6] \"There were no weeping women; no neighhours came in to sit down\\nin the ashes, as they might have done had the soldier died at home;\\nthere was no Nubian dance for the dead, no Egyptian song of the women\\nlauding the memory of the deceased, and beseeching him to tell why he\\nhad left them alone in the world to weep.\"-(Letter from Widdin, March\\n25, 1854, describing a Turkish soldier\\'s funeral.)\\n[FN#7] Captain Haines wisely introduced the custom into Aden. I wonder\\nthat it is not made universal in the cities of India, where so much\\niniquity is perpetrated under the shadow of night.\\n[FN#8] The reason being that respectable Europeans, and the passengers\\nby the Overland Mail, live and lodge in this quarter.\\n[FN#9] \"Our lord,\" i.e. H.H. the Pasha. \"Kikh\" is an interjection\\nnoting disapproval, or disgust.-\"Fie!\" or \"Ugh!\"\\n[FN#10] Shortly after the Ramazan of 1853, the Consul, I am told,\\nobtained an order that British subjects should be sent directly from\\nthe police office, at all hours of the night, to the Consulate. This\\nwas a most sensible measure.\\n[FN#11] Most Eastern nations, owing to their fine ear for sounds, are\\nquick at picking up languages; but the Armenian is here, what the\\nRussian is in the West, the facile princeps of conversational\\nlinguists. I have frequently heard them speak with the purest accent,\\nand admirable phraseology, besides their mother tongue, Turkish,\\nArabic, Persian, and Hindustani, nor do they evince less aptitude for\\nacquiring the Occidental languages.\\n[FN#12] It has been too frequently treated of, to leave room for a\\nfresh description. Though pretty and picturesque, it is open to the\\nreproach of Moslem dressing, namely, that the in-door toilette admits\\nof a display of bust, and is generally so scanty and flimsy that it is\\nunfit to meet the eye of a stranger. This, probably the effect of\\nsecluding women, has now become a cause for concealing them.\\n[FN#13] He was from the banks of the Nile, as his cognomen, al-Basyuni\\nproves, but his family, I was told, had been settled for three or four\\ngenerations at Meccah.\\n[FN#14] Almost all the articles of food were so far useful, that they\\nserved every one of the party at least as much as they did their owner.\\nMy friends drank my coffee, smoked my tobacco, and ate my rice. I\\nbought better tea at Meccah than at Cairo, and found as good sugar\\nthere. It would have been wiser to lay in a small stock merely for the\\nvoyage to Yambu\\', in which case there might have been more economy. But\\nI followed the advice of those interested in setting me wrong. Turks\\nand Egyptians always go pilgrimaging with a large outfit, as notably as\\nthe East-Indian cadet of the present day, and your outfitter at Cairo,\\nas well as Cornhill, is sure to supply you with a variety of\\nsuperfluities. The tent was useful to me; so were the water-skins,\\nwhich I preferred to barrels, as being more portable, and less liable\\nto leak. Good skins cost about a dollar each; they should be bought new\\nand always kept half full of water.\\n[FN#15] This shape secures the lid, which otherwise, on account of the\\nweight of the box, would infallibly be torn off, or burst open. Like\\nthe Kafas, the Sahharah should be well padlocked, and if the owner be a\\nsaving man, he does not entrust his keys to a servant. I gave away my\\nKafas at Yambu\\', because it had been crushed during the sea-voyage, and\\nI was obliged to leave the Sahharah at Al-Madinah, as my Badawi\\ncamel-shaykh positively refused to carry it to Meccah, so that both\\nthese articles were well nigh useless to me. The Kafas cost four\\nshillings, and the Sahharah about twelve. When these large boxes are\\nreally strong and good, they are worth about a pound sterling each.\\n[FN#16] At my final interview with the committee of the Royal\\nGeographical Society, one member, Sir Woodbine Parish, advised an order\\nto be made out on the Society\\'s bankers; another, Sir Roderick\\nMurchison, kindly offered to give me one on his own, Coutts &amp; Co.; but\\nI, having more experience in Oriental travelling, begged only to be\\nfurnished with a diminutive piece of paper, permitting me to draw upon\\nthe Society. It was at once given by Dr. Shaw, the Secretary, and it\\nproved of much use eventually. It was purposely made as small as\\npossible, in order to fit into a talisman case. But the traveller must\\nbear in mind, that if his letters of credit be addressed to Orientals,\\nthe sheet of paper should always be large, and grand-looking. These\\npeople have no faith in notes,-commercial, epistolary, or diplomatic.\\n[FN#17] Before leaving Cairo, I bought English sovereigns for 112, and\\nsold them in Arabia for 122 piastres. \"Abu Takahs,\" (pataks, or Spanish\\npillar-dollars), as they are called in Al-Hijaz, cost me 24 piastres,\\nand in the Holy City were worth 28. The \"Sinku\" (French five franc\\npiece) is bought for 22 piastres in Egypt, and sells at 24 in Arabia.\\nThe silver Majidi costs 20 at Cairo, and is worth 22 in the Red Sea,\\nand finally I gained 3 piastres upon the gold \"Ghazi\" of 19. Such was\\nthe rate of exchange in 1853. It varies, however, perpetually, and in\\n1863 may be totally different.\\n[FN#18] The reason of this will be explained in a future chapter.\\n[FN#19] The Consular dragoman is one of the greatest abuses I know. The\\ntribe is, for the most part, Levantine and Christian, and its\\nconnections are extensive. The father will perhaps be interpreter to\\nthe English, the son to the French Consulate. By this means the most\\nprivy affairs will become known to every member of the department,\\nexcept the head, and eventually to that best of spy-trainers, the\\nTurkish government. This explains how a subordinate, whose pay is L200\\nper annum, and who spends double that sum, can afford, after twelve or\\nthirteen years\\' service, to purchase a house for L2,000 and to furnish\\nit for as much more. Besides which, the condition, the ideas, and the\\nvery nature of these dragomans are completely Oriental. The most timid\\nand cringing of men, they dare not take the proper tone with a\\ngovernment to which, in case of the expulsion of a Consul, they and\\ntheir families would become subject. And their prepossessions are\\nutterly Oriental. Hanna Massara, dragoman to the Consul-General at\\nCairo, in my presence and before others, advocated the secret murder of\\na Moslem girl who had fled with a Greek, on the grounds that an\\nadulteress must always be put to death, either publicly or under the\\nrose. Yet this man is an \"old and tried servant\" of the State. Such\\nevils might be in part mitigated by employing English youths, of whom\\nan ample supply, if there were any demand, would soon be forthcoming.\\nThis measure has been advocated by the best authorities, but without\\nsuccess. Most probably, the reason of the neglect is the difficulty how\\nto begin, or where to end, the Augean labour of Consular reform.\\n[FN#20] In a previous chapter I have alluded to the species of\\nprotection formerly common in the East. Europe, it is to be feared, is\\nnot yet immaculate in this respect, and men say that were a list of\\n\"protected\" furnished by the different Consulates at Cairo, it would be\\na curious document. As no one, Egyptian or foreigner, would, if he\\ncould possibly help it, be subject to the Egyptian government, large\\nsums might be raised by the simple process of naturalising strangers.\\nAt the Persian Consulate 110 dollars-the century for the Consul, and\\nthe decade for his dragoman-have been paid for protection. A stern fact\\nthis for those who advocate the self-government of the childish East.\\n[FN#21] Khan is a title assumed in India and other countries by all\\nAfghans, and Pathans, their descendants, simple as well as gentle.\\n[FN#22] A theologian, a learned man.\\n[FN#23] The stiff, white, plaited kilt worn by Albanians.\\n[FN#24] Those curious about the manners of these desperadoes may\\nconsult the pages of Giovanni Finati (Murray, London, 1830), and I will\\nbe answerable that he exaggerates nothing.\\n[FN#25] Vulgarly Raki, the cognac of Egypt and Turkey. Generically the\\nword means any spirit; specifically, it is applied to that extracted\\nfrom dates, or dried grapes. The latter is more expensive than the\\nformer, and costs from 5 to 7 piastres the bottle. It whitens the water\\nlike Eau de Cologne, and being considered a stomachic, is patronised by\\nEuropeans as much as by Asiatics. In the Azbakiyah gardens at Cairo,\\nthe traveller is astonished by perpetual \"shouts\" for \"Sciroppo di\\ngomma,\" as if all the Western population was afflicted with sore\\nthroat. The reason is that spirituous liquors in a Moslem land must not\\nbe sold in places of public resort; so the infidel asks for a \"syrup of\\ngum,\" and obtains a \"dram\" of \\'Araki. The favourite way of drinking it,\\nis to swallow it neat, and to wash it down with a mouthful of cold\\nwater. Taken in this way it acts like the \"petit verre d\\'absinthe.\"\\nEgyptian women delight in it, and Eastern topers of all classes and\\nsexes prefer it to brandy and cognac, the smell of which, being\\nstrange, is offensive to them.\\n[FN#26] When Egyptians of the middle classes call upon one another, the\\nvisitor always carries with him his tobacco-pouch, which he hands to\\nthe servant, who fills his pipe.\\n[FN#27] The \"Salatah\" is made as follows. Take a cucumber, pare, slice\\nand place it in a plate, sprinkling it over with salt. After a few\\nminutes, season it abundantly with pepper, and put it in a bowl\\ncontaining some peppercorns, and about a pint of curds. When the dish\\nis properly mixed, a live coal is placed upon the top of the compound\\nto make it bind, as the Arabs say. It is considered a cooling dish, and\\nis esteemed by the abstemious, as well as by the toper.\\n[FN#28] These Albanians are at most half Asiatic as regards manner. In\\nthe East generally, the host drinks of the cup, and dips his hand into\\nthe dish before his guest, for the same reason that the master of the\\nhouse precedes his visitor over the threshold. Both actions denote that\\nno treachery is intended, and to reverse them, as amongst us, would be\\na gross breach of custom, likely to excite the liveliest suspicions.\\n[FN#29] Formerly these places, like the coffee-houses, were crowded\\nwith bad characters. Of late years the latter have been refused\\nadmittance, but it would be as easy to bar the door to gnats and flies.\\nThey appear as \"foot-pages,\" as washerwomen, as beggars; in fact, they\\nevade the law with ingenuity and impunity.\\n[FN#30] Isma\\'il Pasha was murdered by Malik Nimr, chief of Shendy, for\\nstriking him with a chibuk across the face. Travellers would do well to\\nremember, that in these lands the pipe-stick and the slipper disgrace a\\nman, whereas a whip or a rod would not do so. The probable reason of\\nthis is, that the two articles of domestic use are applied slightingly,\\nnot seriously, to the purposes of punishment.\\n[FN#31] Anglice, Alexandria, Cairo, and Suez,-an extensive field of\\noperations.\\n</p>\\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Chapter_VIII._FROM_CAIRO_TO_SUEZ.\">Chapter VIII.

But, besides ostentation, I wanted my\\nattendant to be mounted, that we might make a forced march in order to\\nascertain how much a four years\\' life of European effeminacy had\\nimpaired my powers of endurance. The reader may believe the assertion\\nthat there are few better tests than an eighty-four mile ride in\\nmid-summer, on a bad wooden saddle, borne by a worse dromedary, across\\nthe Suez Desert. Even the Squire famed for being copper-sheeted might\\nnot have disdained a trial of the kind.\\n</p><p>I started my Indian boy and heavy luggage for Suez two days before the\\nend of the Id,-laden camels generally taking fifty-five or sixty hours\\nto do the journey, and I spent the intermediate time with Haji Wali. He\\nadvised me to mount about 3 P.M., so that I might arrive at Suez on the\\nevening of the next day, and assisted me\\n</p><p>[p.142]in making due preparations of water, tobacco, and provisions.\\nEarly on the morning of departure the Afghan Shaykh came to the\\nCaravanserai, and breakfasted with us, \"because Allah willed it.\" After\\na copious meal he bestowed upon me a stately benediction, and would\\nhave embraced me, but I humbly bent over his hand: sad to relate,\\nimmediately that his back was turned, Haji Wali raised his forefinger\\nto a right angle with the palm (chaff), and burst into a shout of\\nirreverent laughter. At three o\\'clock Nassar, the Badawi, came to\\nannounce that the dromedaries were saddled. I dressed myself, sticking\\na pistol in my belt, and passing the crimson silk cord of the \"Hamail\"\\nor pocket Koran over my shoulder, in token of being a pilgrim. Then\\ndistributing a few trifling presents to friends and servants, and\\naccompanied by the Shaykh Mohammed and Haji Wali, I descended the\\nstairs with an important gait. In the courtyard squatted the camels,\\n(dromedaries they could not be called,) and I found that a second\\ndriver was going to accompany us. I objected to this, as the extra\\nBadawi would, of course, expect to be fed by me; but Nassar swore that\\nthe man was his brother, and as you rarely gain by small disputes with\\nthese people, he was allowed to have his own way.\\n</p><p>Then came the preparatory leave-takings. Haji Wali embraced me\\nheartily, and so did my poor old Shaykh, who, despite his decrepitude\\nand my objections, insisted upon accompanying me to the city gate. I\\nmounted the camel, crossed my legs before the pommel-stirrups are not\\nused in Egypt[FN#2]-and, preceding my friend, descended\\n</p><p>[p.143]the street leading towards the Desert. As we emerged from the\\nhuge gateway of the Caravanserai all the bystanders, except only the\\nporter, who believed me to be a Persian, and had seen me with the\\ndrunken captain, exclaimed, \"Allah bless thee, Y\\'al-Hajj,[FN#3] and\\nrestore thee to thy country and thy friends!\" And passing through the\\nBab al-Nasr, where I addressed the salutation of peace to the sentry,\\nand to the officer commanding the guard, both gave me God-speed with\\ngreat cordiality[FN#4]-the pilgrim\\'s blessing in Asia, like the old\\nwoman\\'s in Europe, being supposed to possess peculiar efficacy. Outside\\nthe gate my friends took a final leave of me, and I will not deny\\nhaving felt a tightening of heart as their honest faces and forms faded\\nin the distance.\\n</p><p>But Shaykh Nassar switches his camel\\'s shoulder, and appears inclined\\nto take the lead. This is a trial of manliness. There is no time for\\nemotion. Not a moment can be spared, even for a retrospect. I kick my\\ndromedary, who steps out into a jog-trot. The Badawin with a loud\\nringing laugh attempt to give me the go-by. I resist, and we continue\\nlike children till the camels are at their speed, though we have\\neighty-four miles before us, and above us an atmosphere like a furnace\\nblast. The road is deserted at this hour, otherwise grave Moslem\\n</p><p>[p.144]travellers would have believed the police to be nearer than\\nconvenient to us.\\n</p><p>Presently we drew rein, and exchanged our pace for one more seasonable,\\nwhilst the sun began to tell on man and beast. High raised as we were\\nabove the ground, the reflected heat struck us sensibly, and the glare\\nof a macadamized road added a few extra degrees of caloric.[FN#5] The\\nBadawin, to refresh themselves, prepare to smoke. They fill my chibuk,\\nlight it with a flint and steel, and cotton dipped in a solution of\\ngunpowder, and pass it over to me.[FN#6] After a few puffs I return it\\nto them, and they use it turn by turn. Then they begin to while away\\nthe tedium of the road by asking questions, which passe-temps is not\\neasily exhausted; for they are never satisfied till they know as much\\nof you as you do of yourself. They next resort to talking about\\nvictuals; for with this hungry race, food, as a topic of conversation,\\ntakes the place of money in happier lands. And lastly, even this\\nengrossing subject being exhausted for the moment,\\n</p><p>[p.145]they take refuge in singing; and, monotonous and droning as it\\nis, their Modinha has yet an artless plaintiveness, which admirably\\nsuits the singer and the scenery. If you listen to the words, you will\\nsurely hear allusions to bright verdure, cool shades, bubbling rills,\\nor something which hereabouts man hath not, and yet which his soul\\ndesires.\\n</p><p>And now while Nassar and his brother are chaunting a duet,-the refrain\\nbeing,\\n</p><p>\"W\\'al arz mablul bi matar,\"\\n\"And the earth wet with rain,\"-\\n</p><p>I must crave leave to say a few words, despite the triteness of the\\nsubject, about the modern Sinaitic race of Arabs.\\n</p><p>Besides the tribes occupying the northern parts of the peninsula, five\\nchief clans are enumerated by Burckhardt.[FN#7] Nassar, and other\\nauthorities at Suez, divided them into six, namely:-\\n</p><p>1.  Karashi, who, like the Gara in Eastern Arabia, claim an apocryphal\\norigin from the great Koraysh tribe.\\n2.  Salihi, the principal family of the Sinaitic Badawin.\\n3.  Arimi: according to Burckhardt this clan is merely a sub-family of\\nthe Sawalihahs.\\n4.  Sa\\'idi. Burckhardt calls them Walad Sa\\'id and derives them also\\nfrom the Sawalihahs.\\n5.  Aliki&#160;; and lastly, the\\n6.  Muzaynah, generally pronounced M\\'zaynah. This clan claims to be an\\noff-shoot from the great Juhaynah tribe inhabiting the coasts and inner\\nbarrens about Yambu\\'. According to oral tradition, five persons, the\\nancestors of the present Muzaynah race, were forced by a blood-feud to\\nfly their native country. They landed at the Shurum,[FN#8] or\\ncreek-ports, and have now spread themselves\\n</p><p>[p.146]over the Eastern parts of the so-called \"Sinaitic\" peninsula. In\\nAl-Hijaz the Muzaynah is an old and noble tribe. It produced Ka\\'ab\\nal-Ahbar, the celebrated poet, to whom Mohammed gave the cloak which\\nthe Ottomans believe to have been taken by Sultan Salim from Egypt, and\\nto have been converted under the name of Khirkah Sharif, into the\\nnational Oriflamme.\\n</p><p>There are some interesting ethnographical points about these Sinaitic\\nclans-interesting at least to those who would trace the genealogy of\\nthe great Arabian family. Any one who knows the Badawin can see that\\nthe Muzaynah are pure blood. Their brows are broad, their faces narrow,\\ntheir features regular, and their eyes of a moderate size; whereas the\\nother Tawarah[FN#9] (Sinaitic) clans are as palpably Egyptian. They\\nhave preserved that roundness of face which may still be seen in the\\nSphinx as in the modern Copt, and their eyes have that peculiar size,\\nshape, and look, which the old Egyptian painters attempted to express\\nby giving to the profile, the form of the full, organ. Upon this\\nfeature, so characteristic of the Nilotic race, I would lay great\\nstress. No traveller familiar with the true Egyptian eye,-long,\\nalmond-shaped, deeply fringed, slightly raised at the outer corner and\\ndipping in front like the Chinese,[FN#10]-can ever mistake it. It is to\\nbe seen in half-castes, and, as I have before remarked, families\\noriginally from the banks of the Nile, but settled for generations in\\nthe Holy Land of Al-Hijaz, retain the peculiarity.\\n</p><p>I therefore believe the Turi Badawin to be an impure\\n</p><p>[p.147]race, Syro-Egyptian,[FN#11] whereas their neighbour the Hijazi\\nis the pure Syrian or Mesopotamian.\\n</p><p>A wonderful change has taken place in the Tawarah tribes, whilome\\npourtrayed by Sir John Mandeville as \"folke fulle of alle evylle\\ncondiciouns.\" Niebuhr notes the trouble they gave him, and their\\nperpetual hankering for both murder and pillage. Even in the late\\nMohammed Ali\\'s early reign, no governor of Suez dared to flog, or to\\nlay hands upon, a Turi, whatever offence he might have committed within\\nthe walls of the town. Now the Wild Man\\'s sword is taken from him,\\nbefore he is allowed to enter the gates,[FN#12] and my old\\nacquaintance, Ja\\'afar Bey, would think no more of belabouring a Badawi\\nthan of flogging a Fellah.[FN#13] such is the result of\\n</p><p>[p.148]Mohammed Ali\\'s vigorous policy, and such the effects of even\\nsemi-civilisation, when its influence is brought to bear direct upon\\nbarbarism.\\n</p><p>To conclude this subject, the Tawarah still retain many characteristics\\nof the Badawi race. The most good-humoured and sociable of men, they\\ndelight in a jest, and may readily be managed by kindness and courtesy.\\nYet they are passionate, nice upon points of honour, revengeful, and\\neasily offended, where their peculiar prejudices are misunderstood. I\\nhave always found them pleasant companions, and deserving of respect,\\nfor their hearts are good, and their courage is beyond a doubt. Those\\ntravellers who complain of their insolence and extortion may have been\\neither ignorant of their language or offensive to them by assumption of\\nsuperority,-in the Desert man meets man,-or physically unfitted to\\nacquire their esteem.\\n</p><p>We journeyed on till near sunset through the wilderness without ennui.\\nIt is strange how the mind can be amused by scenery that presents so\\nfew objects to occupy it. But in such a country every slight\\nmodification of form or colour rivets observation: the senses are\\nsharpened, and the perceptive faculties, prone to sleep over a confused\\nmass of natural objects, act vigorously when excited by the capability\\nof embracing each detail. Moreover, Desert views are eminently\\nsuggestive; they\\n</p><p>[p.149]appeal to the Future, not to the Past: they arouse because they\\nare by no means memorial. To the solitary wayfarer there is an interest\\nin the Wilderness unknown to Cape seas and Alpine glaciers, and even to\\nthe rolling Prairie,-the effect of continued excitement on the mind,\\nstimulating its powers to their pitch. Above, through a sky terrible in\\nits stainless beauty, and the splendours of a pitiless blinding glare,\\nthe Samun[FN#14] caresses you like a lion with flaming breath. Around\\nlie drifted sand-heaps, upon which each puff of wind leaves its trace\\nin solid waves, flayed rocks, the very skeletons of mountains, and hard\\nunbroken plains, over which he who rides is spurred by the idea that\\nthe bursting of a water-skin, or the pricking of a camel\\'s hoof, would\\nbe a certain death of torture,-a haggard land infested with wild\\nbeasts, and wilder men,-a region whose very fountains murmur the\\nwarning words \"Drink and away!\" What can be more exciting? what more\\nsublime? Man\\'s heart bounds in his breast at the thought of measuring\\nhis puny force with Nature\\'s might, and of emerging triumphant from the\\ntrial. This explains the Arab\\'s proverb, \"Voyaging is victory.\" In the\\nDesert, even more than upon the ocean, there is present death: hardship\\nis there, and piracies, and shipwreck, solitary, not in crowds, where,\\nas the Persians say, \"Death is a Festival\";-and this sense of danger,\\nnever absent, invests the scene of travel with an interest not its own.\\n</p><p>Let the traveller who suspects exaggeration leave the Suez road for an\\nhour or two, and gallop northwards over the sands: in the drear\\nsilence, the solitude, and the fantastic desolation of the place, he\\nwill feel what the Desert may be.\\n</p><p>And then the Oases,[FN#15] and little lines of fertility-\\n</p><p>[p.150]how soft and how beautiful!-even though the Wady al-Ward (the\\nVale of Flowers) be the name of some stern flat upon which a handful of\\nwild shrubs blossom while struggling through a cold season\\'s ephemeral\\nexistence. In such circumstances the mind is influenced through the\\nbody. Though your mouth glows, and your skin is parched, yet you feel\\nno languor, the effect of humid heat; your lungs are lightened, your\\nsight brightens, your memory recovers its tone, and your spirits become\\nexuberant; your fancy and imagination are powerfully aroused, and the\\nwildness and sublimity of the scenes around you stir up all the\\nenergies of your soul-whether for exertion, danger, or strife. Your\\nmorale improves; you become frank and cordial, hospitable and\\nsingle-minded: the hypocritical politeness and the slavery of\\ncivilisation are left behind you in the city. Your senses are\\nquickened: they require no stimulants but air and exercise,-in the\\nDesert spirituous liquors excite only disgust. There is a keen\\nenjoyment in mere animal existence. The sharp appetite disposes of the\\nmost indigestible food;\\n</p><p>[p.151]the sand is softer than a bed of down, and the purity of the air\\nsuddenly puts to flight a dire cohort of diseases. Hence it is that\\nboth sexes, and every age, the most material as well as the most\\nimaginative of minds, the tamest citizen, the parson, the old maid, the\\npeaceful student, the spoiled child of civilisation, all feel their\\nhearts dilate, and their pulses beat strong, as they look down from\\ntheir dromedaries upon the glorious Desert. Where do we hear of a\\ntraveller being disappointed by it? It is another illustration of the\\nancient truth that Nature returns to man, however unworthily he has\\ntreated her. And believe me, when once your tastes have conformed to\\nthe tranquillity of such travel, you will suffer real pain in returning\\nto the turmoil of civilisation. You will anticipate the bustle and the\\nconfusion of artificial life, its luxury and its false pleasures, with\\nrepugnance. Depressed in spirits, you will for a time after your return\\nfeel incapable of mental or bodily exertion. The air of cities will\\nsuffocate you, and the care-worn and cadaverous countenances of\\ncitizens will haunt you like a vision of judgment.[FN#16]\\n</p><p>As the black shadow mounted in the Eastern sky,[FN#17] I turned off the\\nroad, and was suddenly saluted by a figure rising from a little hollow\\nwith an \"As\\' Salamu \\'alaykum\" of truly Arab sound.[FN#18] I looked at\\nthe speaker for a moment without recognising him. He then advanced with\\nvoluble expressions of joy, invited me to sup, seized\\n</p><p>[p.152]my camel\\'s halter without waiting for an answer, \"nakh\\'d[FN#19]\"\\nit (i.e. forced it to kneel), led me hurriedly to a carpet spread in a\\nsandy hollow, pulled off my slippers, gave me cold water for ablution,\\ntold me that he had mistaken me at a distance for a \"Sherif\" (or\\nPrince) of the Arabs, but was delighted to find himself in error; and\\nurged me to hurry over ablution, otherwise that night would come on\\nbefore we could say our prayers. It was Mohammed al-Basyuni, the Meccan\\nboy of whom I had bought my pilgrim-garb at Cairo. There I had refused\\nhis companionship, but here for reasons of his own-one of them was an\\nutter want of money,- he would take no excuse. When he prayed, he stood\\nbehind me,[FN#20] thereby proving pliancy of conscience, for he\\nsuspected me from the first of being at least a heretic.\\n</p><p>After prayer he lighted a pipe, and immediately placed the snake-like\\ntube in my hand; this is an argument which the tired traveller can\\nrarely resist. He then began to rummage my saddle-bags; he drew forth\\nstores of provisions, rolls, water-melons, boiled eggs, and dates, and\\nwhilst lighting the fire and boiling the coffee, he managed to\\ndistribute his own stock, which was neither plentiful nor first-rate,\\nto the camel-men. Shaykh Nassar and his brother looked aghast at this\\nmovement, but the boy was inexorable. They tried a few rough hints,\\nwhich he noticed by singing a Hindustani couplet that asserts the\\nimpropriety of anointing rats\\' heads with jasmine oil. They suspected\\nabuse, and waxed cross; he acknowledged this by deriding them. \"I have\\nheard of Nasrs and Nasirs and Mansurs, but may Allah spare me the\\n</p><p>[p.153]mortification of a Nassar!\" said the boy, relying upon my\\nsupport. And I urged him on, wanting to see how the city Arab treats\\nthe countryman. He then took my tobacco-pouch from the angry Badawin,\\nand in a stage-whisper reproved me for entrusting it to such thieves;\\ninsisting, at the same time, upon drinking all the coffee, so that the\\npoor guides had to prepare some for themselves. He improved every\\nopportunity of making mischief. \"We have eaten water-melon!\" cried\\nNassar, patting its receptacle in token of repletion. \"Dost thou hear,\\nmy lord, how they grumble?-the impudent ruffians!\" remarked\\nMohammed-\"We have eaten water-melon! that is to say, we ought to have\\neaten meat!\" The Badawin, completely out of temper, told him not to\\ntrust himself among their hills. He seized a sword, and began capering\\nabout after the fashion of the East-Indian school of arms, and boasted\\nthat he would attack single-handed the whole clan, which elicited an\\nironical \"Allah! Allah!\" from the hearers.\\n</p><p>After an hour most amusingly spent in this way, I arose, and insisted\\nupon mounting, much to the dissatisfaction of my guides, who wished to\\nsleep there. Shaykh Nassar and his brother had reckoned upon living\\ngratis, for at least three days, judging it improbable that a soft\\nEffendi would hurry himself. When they saw the fair vision dissolve,\\nthey began to finesse: they induced the camel-man, who ran by the side\\nof Mohammed\\'s dromedary, to precede the animal-a favourite manoeuvre to\\nprevent overspeed. Ordered to fall back, the man pleaded fatigue, and\\ninability to walk. The boy Mohammed immediately asked if I had any\\nobjection to dismount one of my guides, and to let his weary attendant\\nride for an hour or so. I at once assented, and the Badawin obeyed me\\nwith ominous grumblings. When we resumed our march the melancholy Arabs\\nhad no song left in them; whereas Mohammed chaunted vociferously, and\\nquoted\\n</p><p>[p.154]bad Hindustani and worse Persian till silence was forcibly\\nimposed upon him. The camel-men lagged behind, in order to prevent my\\ndromedary advancing too fast, and the boy\\'s guide, after dismounting,\\nwould stride along in front of us, under pretext of showing the way.\\nAnd so we jogged on, now walking, then trotting, till the dromedaries\\nbegan to grunt with fatigue, and the Arabs clamoured for a halt.\\n</p><p>At midnight we reached the Central Station, and lay down under its\\nwalls to take a little rest. The dews fell heavily, wetting the sheets\\nthat covered us; but who cares for such trifles in the Desert? The moon\\nshone bright;[FN#21] the breeze blew coolly, and the jackal sang a\\nlullaby which lost no time in inducing the soundest sleep. As the\\nWolf\\'s Tail[FN#22] showed in the heavens we arose. Grey mists floating\\nover the hills northwards gave the Dar al-Bayda,[FN#23] the Pasha\\'s\\nPalace, the look of some old feudal castle. There was a haze in the\\natmosphere, which beautified even the face of Desolation. The swift\\nflying Kata[FN#24] sprang in noisy coveys from the road, and a stray\\ngazelle paced daintily over the stony plain. As we passed by the\\nPilgrims\\' tree, I\\n</p><p>[p.155]added another rag to its coat of tatters.[FN#25] We then invoked\\nthe aid of the holy saint Al-Dakruri[FN#26] from his cream-coloured\\nabode, mounted our camels, and resumed the march in real earnest. The\\ndawn passed away in its delicious coolness, and sultry morning came on.\\nThen day glared in its fierceness, and the noontide sun made the plain\\nglow with terrible heat. Still we pressed onwards.\\n</p><p>At 3 P.M. we turned off the road into a dry water-course, which is not\\nfar from No. 13 Station. The sand was dotted with the dried-up leaves\\nof the Datura, and strongly perfumed by \"Shih,\" a kind of Absinthe\\n(Artemisia),[FN#27] the sweetest herb of the Desert. A Mimosa was\\nthere, and although its shade at this season is little better than\\n</p><p>[p.156]a cocoa tree\\'s,[FN#28] the Badawin would not neglect it. We lay\\ndown upon the sand, to rest among a party of Maghrabi pilgrims\\ntravelling to Suez. These wretches, who were about a dozen in number,\\nappeared to be of the lowest class; their garments consisted of a\\nBurnus-cloak and a pair of sandals; their sole weapon a long knife, and\\ntheir only stock a bag of dry provisions. Each had his large wooden\\nbowl, but none carried water with him. It was impossible to help\\npitying their state, nor could I eat, seeing them hungry, thirsty, and\\nway-worn. So Nassar served out about a pint of water and a little bread\\nto each man. Then they asked for more. None was to be had, so they\\ncried out that money would do as well. I had determined upon being\\ngenerous to the extent of a few pence. Custom, as well as inclination,\\nwas in favour of the act; but when the alms became a demand, and the\\ndemand was backed by fierce looks and a derisive sneer, and a kind of\\nreference to their knives, gentle Charity took the alarm and fled. My\\npistols kept them at bay, for they were only making an attempt to\\nintimidate, and, though I took the precaution of sitting apart from\\nthem, there was no real danger. The Suez road, by the wise regulations\\nof Mohammed Ali, has become as safe to European travellers as that\\nbetween Hampstead and Highgate; and even Easterns have little to fear\\nbut what their fears create. My Indian servant was full of the dangers\\nhe had run, but I did not believe in them. I afterwards heard that the\\nplace where the Maghrabis attempted to frighten what they thought a\\ntimid Turk was notorious for plunder and murder. Here the spurs of two\\nopposite hills almost meet upon the plain, a favourable ground for\\nBadawi ambuscade. Of the Maghrabis\\n</p><p>[p.157]I shall have more to say when relating my voyage in the Pilgrim\\nShip: they were the only travellers from whom we experienced the least\\nannoyance. Numerous parties of Turks, Arabs, and Afghans, and a few\\nEast-Indians[FN#29] were on the same errand as ourselves. All, as we\\npassed them, welcomed us with the friendly salutation that becomes men\\nengaged in a labour of religion.\\n</p><p>About half an hour before sunset, I turned off the road leftwards; and,\\nunder pretext of watering the dromedaries, rode up to inspect the fort\\nAl-\\'Ajrudi.[FN#30] It is a quadrangle with round towers at the gateway\\nand at the corners, newly built of stone and mortar; the material is\\nalready full of crevices, and would not stand before a twelve-pounder.\\nWithout guns or gunners, it is occupied by about a dozen Fellahs, who\\nact as hereditary \"Ghafirs,\" (guardians); they were expecting at that\\ntime to be reinforced by a party of Bashi Buzuks-Irregulars from Cairo.\\nThe people of the country were determined that an English fleet would\\nsoon appear in the Red Sea, and this fort is by them ridiculously\\nconsidered the key of Suez. As usual in these Vauban-lacking\\n</p><p>[p.158]lands, the well supplying the stronghold is in a detached and\\ndistant building, which can be approached by an enemy with the greatest\\nsecurity. Over the gate-way was an ancient inscription reversed; the\\nwater was brackish, and of bad quality.[FN#31]\\n</p><p>We resumed our way: Suez now stood near. In the blue distance rose the\\ncastellated peaks of Jabal Rahah and the wide sand-tracts over which\\nlies the land-route to Al-Hijaz. Before us the sight ever dear to\\nEnglish eyes,-a strip of sea gloriously azure, with a gallant steamer\\nwalking the waters. On the right-hand side the broad slopes of Jabal\\nMukattam, a range of hills which flanks the road all the way from\\nCairo. It was at this hour a spectacle not easily to be forgotten. The\\nnear range of chalk and sandstone wore a russet suit, gilt where the\\nlast rays of the sun seamed it with light, and the deep folds were\\nshaded with the richest purple; whilst the background of the higher\\nhills, Jabal Tawari, generally known as Abu Daraj (the Father of\\nSteps), was sky-blue streaked with the lightest plum colour. We drew up\\nat a small building called Bir Suways (Well of Suez); and, under\\npretext of watering the cattle, I sat for half an hour admiring the\\ncharms of the Desert. The eye never tires of such loveliness of hue,\\nand the memory of the hideousness of this range, when a sun in front\\nexposed each gaunt and barren feature, supplied the evening view with\\nanother element of attraction.\\n</p><p>It was already night when we passed through the tumbling six-windowed\\ngateway of Suez; and still remained the task of finding my servant and\\neffects. After\\n</p><p>[p.159]wandering in and out of every Wakalah in the village, during\\nwhich peregrination the boy Mohammed proved himself so useful that I\\ndetermined at all risks to make him my companion, we accidentally heard\\nthat a Hindi had taken lodgings at a hostelry bearing the name of\\nJirjis al-Zahr.[FN#32] On arriving there our satisfaction was\\ndiminished by the intelligence that the same Hindi, after locking the\\ndoor, had gone out with his friends to a ship in the harbour; in fact,\\nthat he had made all preparations for running away. I dismounted, and\\ntried to persuade the porter to break open the wooden bolt, but he\\nabsolutely refused, and threatened the police. Meanwhile Mohammed had\\nfound a party of friends, men of Al-Madinah, returning to the\\npilgrimage after a begging tour through Egypt and Turkey. The meeting\\nwas characterised by vociferous inquiries, loud guffaws and warm\\nembraces. I was invited to share their supper and their dormitory,-an\\nuncovered platform projecting from the gallery over the square court\\nbelow,-but I had neither appetite nor spirits enough to be sociable.\\nThe porter, after much persuasion, showed me an empty room, in which I\\nspread my carpet. That was a sad night. My eighty-four mile ride had\\nmade every bone ache; I had lost epidermis, and the sun had seared\\nevery portion of skin exposed to it. So, lamenting my degeneracy and\\nthe ill effects of four years\\' domicile in Europe, and equally\\ndisquieted in mind about the fate of my goods and chattels, I fell into\\nan uncomfortable sleep.\\n</p><p>[FN#l] The proper hire of a return dromedary from Cairo to Suez is\\nforty piastres. But every man is charged in proportion to his rank, and\\nEuropeans generally pay about double.\\n[FN#2] The tender traveller had better provide himself with a pair of\\nstirrups, but he will often find, when on camel back, that his legs are\\nmore numbed by hanging down, than by the Arab way of crossing them\\nbefore and beneath the pommel. He must, however, be careful to inspect\\nhis saddle, and, should bars of wood not suit him, to have them covered\\nwith stuffed leather. And again, for my part, I would prefer riding a\\ncamel with a nose-ring,-Mongol and Sindian fashion,-to holding him, as\\nthe Egyptians do, with a halter, or to guiding him,-Wahhabiwise,-with a\\nstick.\\n[FN#3] \"O pilgrim!\" The Egyptians write the word Hajj, and pronounce\\nHagg. In Persia, India, and Turkey, it becomes Haji. These are mere\\nvarieties of form, derived from one and the same Arabic root.\\n[FN#4] The Egyptians and Arabs will not address \"Salam\" to an infidel;\\nthe Moslems of India have no such objection. This, on the banks of the\\nNile, is the revival of an old prejudice. Alexander of Alexandria, in\\nhis circular letter, describes the Arian heretics as \"men whom it is\\nnot lawful to salute, or to bid God-speed.\"\\n[FN#5] It is Prince Puckler Muskau, if I recollect rightly, who\\nmentions that in his case a pair of dark spectacles produced a marked\\ndifference of apparent temperature, whilst travelling over the sultry\\nsand of the Desert. I have often remarked the same phenomenon. The\\nArabs, doubtless for some reason of the kind, always draw their\\nhead-kerchiefs, like hoods, far over their brows, and cover up their\\nmouths, even when the sun and wind are behind them. Inhabitants of the\\nDesert are to be recognised by the net-work of wrinkles traced in the\\nskin round the orbits, the result of half-closing their eyelids; but\\nthis is done to temper the intensity of the light.\\n[FN#6] Their own pipe-tubes were of coarse wood, in shape somewhat\\nresembling the German porcelain pipe. The bowl was of soft stone,\\napparently steatite, which, when fresh, is easily fashioned with a\\nknife. In Arabia the Badawin, and even the townspeople, use on journeys\\nan earthen tube from five to six inches shorter than the English\\n\"clay,\" thicker in the tube, with a large bowl, and coloured\\nyellowish-red. It contains a handful of tobacco, and the smoker emits\\npuffs like a chimney. In some of these articles the bowl forms a\\nrectangle with the tube; in others, the whole is an unbroken curve,\\nlike the old Turkish Meerschaum.\\n[FN#7] See Wallin\\'s papers, published in the Journals of the Royal\\nGeographical Society.\\n[FN#8] Shurum, (plural of Sharm, a creek), a word prefixed to the\\nproper names of three small ports in the Sinaitic peninsula.\\n[FN#9] Tawarah, plural of Turi, an inhabitant of Tur or Sinai.\\n[FN#10] This feature did not escape the practised eye of Denon. \"Eyes\\nlong, almond-shaped, half shut, and languishing, and turned up at the\\nouter corner, as if habitually fatigued by the light and heat of the\\nsun; cheeks round, &amp;c.,\" (Voyage en Egypt). The learned Frenchman\\'s\\ndescription of the ancient Egyptians applies in most points to the Turi\\nBadawin.\\n[FN#11] \"And he\" (Ishmael) \"dwelt in the wilderness of Paran,\" (Wady\\nFiran?) \"and his mother took him a wife, out of the land of Egypt,\"\\n(Gen. xxi. 21). I wonder that some geographers have attempted to\\nidentify Massa, the son of Ishmael, (Gen. xxv. 14), with Meccah, when\\nin verse 18 of the same chapter we read, \"And they\" (the twelve\\nprinces, sons of Ishmael) \"dwelt from Havilah unto Shur.\" This asserts,\\nas clearly as language can, that the posterity of, or the race typified\\nby, Ishmael,-the Syro-Egyptian,-occupied only the northern parts of the\\npeninsula. Their habitat is not even included in Arabia by those\\nwriters who bound the country on the north by an imaginary line drawn\\nfrom Ras Mohammed to the mouths of the Euphrates. The late Dr. J.\\nWilson (\"Lands of the Bible\"), repeated by Eliot Warburton (\"Crescent\\nand Cross\"), lays stress upon the Tawarah tradition, that they are Benu\\nIsra\\'il converted to Al-Islam, considering it a fulfilment of the\\nprophecy, \"that a remnant of Israel shall dwell in Edom.\" With due\\ndeference to so illustrious an Orientalist and Biblical scholar as was\\nDr. Wilson, I believe that most modern Moslems, being ignorant that\\nJacob was the first called \"prince with God,\" apply the term\\nBenu-Isra\\'il to all the posterity of Abraham, not to Jews only.\\n[FN#12] In 1879 the Gates of Suez are a thing of the past; and it is\\nnot easy to find where they formerly stood.\\n[FN#13] In the mouth of a Turk, no epithet is more contemptuous than\\nthat of \"Fellah ibn Fellah,\"-\"boor, son of a boor!\" The Osmanlis have,\\nas usual, a semi-religious tradition to account for the superiority of\\ntheir nation over the Egyptians. When the learned doctor, Abu Abdullah\\nMohammed bin Idris al-Shafe\\'i, returned from Meccah to the banks of the\\nNile, he mounted, it is said, a donkey belonging to one of the Asinarii\\nof Bulak. Arriving at the Caravanserai, he gave the man ample fare,\\nwhereupon the Egyptian, putting forth his hand, and saying, \"hat\"\\n(give!) called for more. The doctor doubled the fee; still the double\\nwas demanded. At last the divine\\'s purse was exhausted, and the\\nproprietor of the donkey waxed insolent. A wandering Turk seeing this,\\ntook all the money from the Egyptian, paid him his due, solemnly kicked\\nhim, and returned the rest to Al-Shafe\\'i, who asked him his\\nname-\"Osman\"-and his nation-the \"Osmanli,\"-blessed him, and prophesied\\nto his countrymen supremacy over the Fellahs and donkey boys of Egypt.\\n[FN#14] From Samm, the poison-wind. Vulgar and most erroneously called\\nthe Simoon.\\n[FN#15] Hugh Murray derives this word from the Egyptian, and quoting\\nStrabo and Abulfeda makes it synonymous with Auasis and Hyasis. I\\nbelieve it to be a mere corruption of the Arabic Wady [Arabic text] or\\nWah. Nothing can be more incorrect than the vulgar idea of an Arabian\\nOasis, except it be the popular conception of an Arabian Desert. One\\nreads of \"isles of the sandy sea,\" but one never sees them. The real\\n\"Wady\" is, generally speaking, a rocky valley bisected by the bed of a\\nmountain torrent, dry during the hot season. In such places the Badawin\\nlove to encamp, because they find food and drink,-water being always\\nprocurable by digging. When the supply is perennial, the Wady becomes\\nthe site of a village. The Desert is as unaptly compared to a \"sandy\\nsea.\" Most of the wilds of Arabia resemble the tract between Suez and\\nCairo; only the former are of primary formation, whereas the others are\\nof a later date. Sand-heaps are found in every Desert, but sand-plains\\nare a local feature, not the general face of the country. The\\nWilderness, east of the Nile, is mostly a hard dry earth, which\\nrequires only a monsoon to become highly productive: even where\\nsilicious sand covers the plain, the waters of a torrent, depositing\\nhumus or vegetable mould, bind the particles together, and fit it for\\nthe reception of seed.\\n[FN#16] The intelligent reader will easily understand that I am\\nspeaking of the Desert in the temperate season, not during the summer\\nheats, when the whole is one vast furnace, nor in winter, when the\\nSarsar wind cuts like an Italian Tramontana.\\n[FN#17] This, as a general rule in Al-Islam, is a sign that the Maghrib\\nor evening prayer must not be delayed. The Shafe\\'i school performs its\\ndevotions immediately after the sun has disappeared.\\n[FN#18] This salutation of peace is so differently pronounced by every\\nEastern nation that the observing traveller will easily make of it a\\nshibboleth.\\n[FN#19] To \"nakh\" in vulgar, as in classical, Arabic is to gurgle \"Ikh!\\nikh!\" in the bottom of one\\'s throat till the camel kneels down. We have\\nno English word for this proceeding; but Anglo-Oriental travellers are\\nrapidly naturalising the \"nakh.\"\\n</p><p>[FN#20] There are many qualifications necessary for an Imam-a leader of\\nprayer; the first condition, of course, is orthodoxy.\\n[FN#21] \"The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night,\"\\n(Psalm cxxi. 6). Easterns still believe firmly in the evil effects of\\nmoonlight upon the human frame,-from Sind to Abyssinia, the traveller\\nwill hear tales of wonder concerning it.\\n[FN#22] The Dum i Gurg, or wolf\\'s tail, is the Persian name for the\\nfirst brushes of grey light which appear as forerunners of dawn.\\n[FN#23] Dar al-Bayda is a palace belonging to H.H. Abbas Pasha. This\\n\"white house\" was formerly called the \"red house,\" I believe from the\\ncolour of its windows,-but the name was changed, as being not\\nparticularly good-omened.\\n[FN#24] The Tetrao Kata or sand-grouse, (Pterocles melanogaster; in\\nSind called the rock pigeon), is a fast-flying bird, not unlike a grey\\npartridge whilst upon the wing. When, therefore, Shanfara boasts \"The\\nash-coloured Katas can only drink my leavings, after hastening all\\nnight to slake their thirst in the morning,\" it is a hyperbole to\\nexpress exceeding swiftness.\\n[FN#25] I have already, when writing upon the subject of Sind, alluded\\nto this system as prevalent throughout Al-Islam, and professed, like\\nMr. Lane, ignorance of its origin and object. In Huc\\'s travels, we are\\ntold that the Tartars worship mountain spirits by raising an \"Obo,\"-dry\\nbranches hung with bones and strips of cloth, and planted in enormous\\nheaps of stones. Park, also, in Western Africa, conformed to the\\nexample of his companions, in adding a charm or shred of cloth on a\\ntree (at the entrance of the Wilderness), which was completely covered\\nwith these guardian symbols. And, finally, the Tarikh Tabari mentions\\nit as a practice of the Pagan Arabs, and talks of evil spirits residing\\nin the date-tree. May not, then, the practice in Al-Islam be one of the\\nmany debris of fetish-worship which entered into the heterogeneous\\nformation of the Saving Faith? Some believe that the Prophet permitted\\nthe practice, and explain the peculiar name of the expedition called\\nZat al-Rika\\'a (place of shreds of cloth), by supposing it to be a term\\nfor a tree to which the Moslems hung their ex-voto rags.\\n[FN#26] The saint lies under a little white-washed dome, springing from\\na square of low walls-a form of sepulchre now common to Al-Hijaz,\\nEgypt, and the shores and islands of the Red Sea. As regards his name\\nmy informants told me it was that of a Hijazi Shaykh. The subject is by\\nno means interesting; but the exact traveller will find the word\\nwritten Takroore, and otherwise explained by Sir Gardner Wilkinson.\\n[FN#27] Called by the Arabs Shih [Arabic text], which the dictionaries\\ntranslate \"wormwood of Pontus.\" We find Wallin in his works speaking of\\nFerashat al-shih, or wormwood carpets.\\n[FN#28] We are told in verse of \"a cocoa\\'s feathery shade,\" and sous\\nl\\'ombre d\\'un cocotier. But to realise the prose picture, let the home\\nreader, choosing some sultry August day, fasten a large fan to a long\\npole, and enjoy himself under it.\\n[FN#29] On a subsequent occasion, I met a party of Panjabis, who had\\nwalked from Meccah to Cairo in search of \"Abu Tabilah,\" (General\\nAvitabile), whom report had led to the banks of the Nile. Some were\\nyoung, others had white beards-all were weary and wayworn; but the\\nsaddest sight was an old woman, so decrepit that she could scarcely\\nwalk. The poor fellows were travelling on foot, carrying their wallets,\\nwith a few pence in their pockets, utterly ignorant of route and road,\\nand actually determined in this plight to make Lahore by Baghdad,\\nBushir, and Karachi. Such-so incredible-is Indian improvidence!\\n[FN#30] Upon this word Cacography has done her worst-\"Haji Rood\" may\\nserve for a specimen. My informants told me that Al-\\'Ajrudi is the name\\nof a Hijazi Shaykh whose mortal remains repose under a little dome near\\nthe fort. This, if it be true, completely nullifies the efforts of\\nEtymology to discern in it a distinct allusion to \"the overthrow of\\nPharaoh\\'s chariots, whose Hebrew appellation, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdAgeloot,\\' bears some\\nresemblance to this modern name.\"\\n[FN#31] The only sweet water in Suez is brought on camel back from the\\nNile, across the Desert. The \"Bir Suez\" is fit for beasts only; the\\n\\'Uyun Musa (Moses\\' Wells) on the Eastern side, and that below Abu\\nDaraj, on the Western shore of the Suez Gulf, are but little better.\\nThe want of sweet water is the reason why no Hammam is found at Suez.\\n[FN#32] The \"George\": so called after its owner, a Copt, Consular Agent\\nfor Belgium. There are 36 Caravanserais at Suez, 33 small ones for\\nmerchandise, and 3 for travellers; of these the best is that of Sayyid\\nHashim. The pilgrim, however, must not expect much comfort or\\nconvenience, even at Sayyid Hashim\\'s.\\n</p>\\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Chapter_IX._SUEZ.\">Chapter IX.

They\\nunanimously advised a visit to the governor, whom, however, they\\ndescribed to be a \"Kalb ibn kalb,\" (dog, son of a dog,) who never\\nreturned Moslems\\' salutations, and who thought all men dirt to be\\ntrodden under foot by the Turks. The boy Mohammed showed his savoir\\nfaire by extracting from his huge Sahara-box a fine embroidered cap,\\nand a grand peach-coloured coat, with which I was instantly invested;\\nhe dressed himself with similar magnificence, and we then set out to\\nthe \"palace.\"\\n</p><p>Ja\\'afar Bey,-he has since been deposed,-then occupied the position of\\njudge, officer commanding, collector of customs, and magistrate of\\nSuez. He was a Mir-liwa, or brigadier-general, and had some reputation\\nas a soldier, together with a slight tincture of European science and\\nlanguage. The large old Turk received me most superciliously, disdained\\nall return of salam, and, fixing upon me two little eyes like gimlets,\\ndemanded my business. I stated that one Shaykh Nur, my Hindi servant,\\nhad played me false; therefore I required permission to break into the\\nroom supposed to contain my effects. He asked my profession. I replied\\nthe medical. This led him to inquire if I had any medicine for the\\neyes, and\\n</p><p>[p.161]being answered in the affirmative, he sent a messenger with me\\nto enforce obedience on the part of the porter. The obnoxious measure\\nwas, however, unnecessary. As we entered the Caravanserai, there\\nappeared at the door the black face of Shaykh Nur, looking, though\\naccompanied by sundry fellow-countrymen, uncommonly as if he merited\\nand expected the bamboo. He had, by his own account, been seduced into\\nthe festivities of a coal-hulk, manned by Lascars, and the vehemence of\\nhis self-accusation saved him from the chastisement which I had\\ndetermined to administer.\\n</p><p>I must now briefly describe the party of Meccah and Madinah men into\\nwhich fate threw me: their names will so frequently appear in the\\nfollowing pages, that a few words about their natures will not be\\nmisplaced.\\n</p><p>First of all comes Omar Effendi,-so called in honour,-a Daghistani or\\nEast-Circassian, the grandson of a Hanafi Mufti at Al-Madinah, and the\\nson of a Shaykh Rakb, an officer whose duty it is to lead\\ndromedary-caravans. He sits upon his cot, a small, short, plump body,\\nof yellow complexion and bilious temperament, grey-eyed, soft-featured,\\nand utterly beardless,-which affects his feelings,-he looks fifteen,\\nand he owns to twenty-eight. His manners are those of a student; he\\ndresses respectably, prays regularly, hates the fair sex, like an Arab,\\nwhose affections and aversions are always in extremes; is \"serious,\"\\nhas a mild demeanour, an humble gait, and a soft, slow voice. When\\nroused he becomes furious as a Bengal tiger. His parents have urged him\\nto marry, and he, like Kamar al-Zaman, has informed his father that he\\nis \"a person of great age, but little sense.\" Urged moreover by a\\nmelancholy turn of mind, and the want of leisure for study at\\nAl-Madinah, he fled the paternal domicile, and entered himself a pauper\\nTalib \\'ilm (student) in the Azhar Mosque. His disconsolate friends and\\nafflicted relations sent a confidential man to fetch him home, by\\n</p><p>[p.162]force should it be necessary; he has yielded, and is now\\nawaiting the first opportunity of travelling gratis, if possible, to\\nAl-Madinah.\\n</p><p>That confidential man is a negro-servant, called Sa\\'ad, notorious in\\nhis native city as Al-Jinni, the Demon. Born and bred a slave in Omar\\nEffendi\\'s family, he obtained manumission, became a soldier in\\nAl-Hijaz, was dissatisfied with pay perpetually in arrears, turned\\nmerchant, and wandered far and wide, to Russia, to Gibraltar, and to\\nBaghdad. He is the pure African, noisily merry at one moment, at\\nanother silently sulky; affectionate and abusive, brave and boastful,\\nreckless and crafty, exceedingly quarrelsome, and unscrupulous to the\\nlast degree. The bright side of his character is his love and respect\\nfor the young master, Omar Effendi; yet even him he will scold in a\\nparoxysm of fury, and steal from him whatever he can lay his hands on.\\nHe is generous with his goods, but is ever borrowing and never paying\\nmoney; he dresses like a beggar, with the dirtiest Tarbush upon his\\ntufty poll, and only a cotton shirt over his sooty skin; whilst his two\\nboxes are full of handsome apparel for himself and the three ladies,\\nhis wives, at Al-Madinah. He knows no fear but for those boxes.\\nFrequently during our search for a vessel he forced himself into\\nJa\\'afar Bey\\'s presence, and there he demeaned himself so impudently,\\nthat we expected to see him lamed by the bastinado; his forwardness,\\nhowever, only amused the dignitary. He wanders all day about the bazar,\\ntalking about freight and passage, for he has resolved, cost what it\\nwill, to travel free, and, with doggedness like his, he must succeed.\\n</p><p>Shaykh Hamid al-Samman derives his cognomen, the\\n\"Clarified-Butter-Seller,\" from a celebrated saint and Sufi of the\\nKadiriyah order, who left a long line of holy descendants at\\nAl-Madinah. This Shaykh squats upon a box full of presents for the\\n\"daughter of his paternal uncle\"\\n</p><p>[p.163](his wife), a perfect specimen of the town Arab. His poll is\\ncrowned with a rough Shushah or tuft of hair[FN#1]; his face is of a\\ndirty brown, his little goatee straggles untrimmed; his feet are bare,\\nand his only garment is an exceedingly unclean ochre-coloured blouse,\\ntucked into a leathern girdle beneath it. He will not pray, because he\\nis unwilling to take pure clothes out of his box; but he smokes when he\\ncan get other people\\'s tobacco, and groans between the whiffs,\\nconjugating the verb all day, for he is of active mind. He can pick out\\nhis letters, and he keeps in his bosom a little dog\\'s-eared MS. full of\\nserious romances and silly prayers, old and exceedingly ill written;\\nthis he will draw forth at times, peep into for a moment, devoutly\\nkiss, and restore to its proper place with the veneration of the vulgar\\nfor a book. He can sing all manner of songs, slaughter a sheep with\\ndexterity, deliver a grand call to prayer, shave, cook, fight; and he\\nexcels in the science of vituperation: like Sa\\'ad, he never performs\\nhis devotions, except\\n</p><p>[p.164]when necessary to \"keep up appearances,\" and though he has sworn\\nto perish before he forgets his vow to the \"daughter of his uncle,\" I\\nshrewdly suspect he is no better than he should be. His brow crumples\\nat the word wine, but there is quite another expression about the\\nregion of the mouth; Stambul, where he has lived some months, without\\nlearning ten words of Turkish, is a notable place for displacing\\nprejudice. And finally, he has not more than a piastre or two in his\\npocket, for he has squandered the large presents given to him at Cairo\\nand Constantinople by noble ladies, to whom he acted as master of the\\nceremonies at the tomb of the Apostle.\\n</p><p>Stretched on a carpet, smoking a Persian Kaliun all day, lies Salih\\nShakkar, a Turk on the father\\'s, and an Arab on the mother\\'s side, born\\nat Al-Madinah. This lanky youth may be sixteen years old, but he has\\nthe ideas of forty-six; he is thoroughly greedy, selfish, and\\nungenerous; coldly supercilious as a Turk, and energetically avaricious\\nas an Arab. He prays more often, and dresses more respectably, than the\\ndescendant of the Clarified-Butter-Seller; he affects the\\nConstantinople style of toilette, and his light yellow complexion makes\\npeople consider him a \"superior person.\" We were intimate enough on the\\nroad, when he borrowed from me a little money. But at Al-Madinah he cut\\nme pitilessly, as a \"town man\" does a continental acquaintance\\naccidentally met in Hyde Park; and of course he tried, though in vain,\\nto evade repaying his debt. He had a tincture of letters, and appeared\\nto have studied critically the subject of \"largesse.\" \"The Generous is\\nAllah\\'s friend, aye, though he be a Sinner, and the Miser is Allah\\'s\\nFoe, aye, though he be a Saint,\" was a venerable saying always in his\\nmouth. He also informed me that Pharaoh, although the quintessence of\\nimpiety, is mentioned by name in the Koran, by reason of his\\nliberality; whereas Nimrod, another monster of iniquity, is only\\nalluded to, because\\n</p><p>[p.165]he was a stingy tyrant. It is almost needless to declare that\\nSalih Shakkar was, as the East-Indians say, a very \"fly-sucker.[FN#2]\"\\nThere were two other men of Al-Madinah in the Wakalah Jirgis; but I\\nomit description, as we left them, they being penniless, at Suez. One\\nof them, Mohammed Shiklibha, I afterwards met at Meccah, and seldom\\nhave I seen a more honest and warm-hearted fellow. When we were\\nembarking at Suez, he fell upon Hamid\\'s bosom, and both of them wept\\nbitterly, at the prospect of parting even for a few days.\\n</p><p>All the individuals above mentioned lost no time in opening the\\nquestion of a loan. It was a lesson in Oriental metaphysics to see\\ntheir condition. They had a twelve days\\' voyage, and a four days\\'\\njourney before them; boxes to carry, custom-houses to face, and\\nstomachs to fill; yet the whole party could scarcely, I believe, muster\\ntwo dollars of ready money. Their boxes were full of valuables, arms,\\nclothes, pipes, slippers, sweetmeats, and other \"notions\"; but nothing\\nshort of starvation would have induced them to pledge the smallest\\narticle.\\n</p><p>Foreseeing that their company would be an advantage, I hearkened\\nfavourably to the honeyed request for a few crowns. The boy Mohammed\\nobtained six dollars; Hamid about five pounds, as I intended to make\\nhis house at Al-Madinah my home; Omar Effendi three dollars; Sa\\'ad the\\nDemon two-I gave the money to him at Yambu\\',-and Salih Shakkar fifty\\npiastres. But since in these lands, as a rule, no one ever lends coins,\\nor, borrowing, ever returns them, I took care to exact service from the\\nfirst, to take two rich coats from the second, a handsome pipe from the\\nthird, a \"bala\" or yataghan from the fourth, and from the fifth an\\nimitation Cashmere shawl. After which, we sat down and drew\\n</p><p>[p.166]out the agreement. It was favourable to me: I lent them Egyptian\\nmoney, and bargained for repayment in the currency of Al-Hijaz, thereby\\ngaining the exchange, which is sometimes sixteen per cent. This was\\ndone, not so much for the sake of profit, as with the view of becoming\\na Hatim,[FN#3] by a \"never mind\" on settling day. My companions having\\nreceived these small sums, became affectionate and eloquent in my\\npraise: they asked me to make one of their number at meals for the\\nfuture, overwhelmed me with questions, insisted upon a present of\\nsweetmeats, detected in me a great man under a cloud,-perhaps my claims\\nto being a Darwaysh assisted them to this discovery,-and declared that\\nI should perforce be their guest at Meccah and Al-Madinah. On all\\noccasions precedence was forced upon me; my opinion was the first\\nconsulted, and no project was settled without my concurrence: briefly,\\nAbdullah the Darwaysh suddenly found himself a person of consequence.\\nThis elevation led me into an imprudence which might have cost me dear;\\naroused the only suspicion about me ever expressed during the summer\\'s\\ntour. My friends had looked at my clothes, overhauled my medicine\\nchest, and criticised my pistols; they sneered at my copper-cased\\nwatch,[FN#4] and remembered having seen a compass at Constantinople.\\nTherefore I imagined they would think little about a sextant. This was\\na mistake. The boy Mohammed, I\\n</p><p>[p.167]afterwards learned,[FN#5] waited only my leaving the room to\\ndeclare that the would-be Haji was one of the Infidels from India, and\\na council sat to discuss the case. Fortunately for me, Omar Effendi had\\nlooked over a letter which I had written to Haji Wali that morning, and\\nhe had at various times received categorical replies to certain\\nquestions in high theology. He felt himself justified in declaring, ex\\ncathedra, the boy Mohammed\\'s position perfectly untenable. And Shaykh\\nHamid, who looked forward to being my host, guide, and debtor in\\ngeneral, and probably cared scantily for catechism or creed, swore that\\nthe light of Al-Islam was upon my countenance, and, consequently, that\\nthe boy Mohammed was a pauper, a \"fakir,\" an owl, a cut-off one,[FN#6]\\na stranger, and a Wahhabi (heretic), for daring to impugn the faith of\\na brother believer.[FN#7] The scene ended with a general abuse of the\\nacute youth, who was told on all sides that he had no shame, and was\\ndirected to \"fear Allah.\" I was struck with the expression of my\\nfriends\\' countenances when they saw the sextant, and, determining with\\na sigh to\\n</p><p>[p.168]leave it behind, I prayed five times a day for nearly a week.\\n</p><p>We all agreed not to lose an hour in securing places on board some\\nvessel bound for Yambu\\'; and my companions, hearing that my passport as\\na British Indian was scarcely en regle, earnestly advised me to have it\\nsigned by the governor without delay, whilst they occupied themselves\\nabout the harbour. They warned me that if I displayed the Turkish\\nTazkirah given me at the citadel of Cairo, I should infallibly be\\nordered to await the caravan, and lose their society and friendship.\\nPilgrims arriving at Alexandria, be it known to the reader, are divided\\ninto bodies, and distributed by means of passports to the three great\\nroads, namely, Suez, Kusayr (Cosseir), and the Hajj route by land round\\nthe Gulf of al-\\'Akabah. After the division has once been made,\\ngovernment turns a deaf ear to the representations of individuals. The\\nBey of Suez has an order to obstruct pilgrims as much as possible till\\nthe end of the season, when they are hurried down that way, lest they\\nshould arrive at Meccah too late.[FN#8] As most of the Egyptian high\\nofficials have boats, which sail up the Nile laden with pilgrims and\\nreturn freighted with corn, the government naturally does its utmost to\\nforce the delays and discomforts of this line upon strangers.[FN#9] And\\nas those who travel by the Hajj route must spend money in the Egyptian\\nterritories at least fifteen days longer than they would if allowed to\\n</p><p>[p.169]embark at once from Suez, the Bey very properly assists them in\\nthe former and obstructs them in the latter case. Knowing these facts,\\nI felt that a difficulty was at hand. The first thing was to take\\nShaykh Nur\\'s passport, which was en regle, and my own, which was not,\\nto the Bey for signature. He turned the papers over and over, as if\\nunable to read them, and raised false hopes high by referring me to his\\nclerk. The under-official at once saw the irregularity of the document,\\nasked me why it had not been vise at Cairo, swore that under such\\ncircumstances nothing would induce the Bey to let me proceed; and, when\\nI tried persuasion, waxed insolent. I feared that it would be necessary\\nto travel via Cosseir, for which there was scarcely time, or to\\ntransfer myself on camel-back to the harbour of Tur, and there to await\\nthe chance of finding a place in some half-filled vessel to\\nAl-Hijaz,-which would have been relying upon an accident. My last hope\\nat Suez was to obtain assistance from Mr. West, then H.B.M.\\'s\\nVice-Consul, and since made Consul. I therefore took the boy Mohammed\\nwith me, choosing him on purpose, and excusing the step to my\\ncompanions by concocting an artful fable about my having been, in\\nAfghanistan, a benefactor to the British nation. We proceeded to the\\nConsulate. Mr. West, who had been told by imprudent Augustus Bernal to\\nexpect me, saw through the disguise, despite jargon assumed to satisfy\\nofficial scruples, and nothing could be kinder than the part he took.\\nHis clerk was directed to place himself in communication with the Bey\\'s\\nfactotum; and, when objections to signing the Alexandrian Tazkirah were\\noffered, the Vice-Consul said that he would, at his own risk, give me a\\nfresh passport as a British subject from Suez to Arabia. His firmness\\nprevailed: on the second day, the documents were returned to me in a\\nsatisfactory state. I take a pleasure in owning this obligation to Mr.\\nWest: in the course of my wanderings, I have often\\n</p><p>[p.170] received from him open-hearted hospitality and the most\\nfriendly attentions.\\n</p><p>Whilst these passport difficulties were being solved, the rest of the\\nparty was as busy in settling about passage and passage-money. The\\npeculiar rules of the port of Suez require a few words of\\nexplanation.[FN#10] \"About thirty-five years ago\" (i.e. about 1818\\nA.D.), \"the ship-owners proposed to the then government, with the view\\nof keeping up freight, a Farzah, or system of rotation. It might be\\nsupposed that the Pasha, whose object notoriously was to retain all\\nmonoplies in his own hands, would have refused his sanction to such a\\nmeasure. But it so happened in those days that all the court had ships\\nat Suez: Ibrahim Pasha alone owned four or five. Consequently, they\\nexpected to share profits with the merchants, and thus to be\\ncompensated for the want of port-dues. From that time forward all the\\nvessels in the harbour were registered, and ordered to sail in\\nrotation. This arrangement benefits the owner of the craft \\xef\\xbf\\xbden depart,\\'\\ngiving him in his turn a temporary monopoly, with the advantage of a\\nfull market; and freight is so high that a single trip often clears off\\nthe expense of building and the risk of losing the ship-a sensible\\nsuccedaneum for insurance companies. On the contrary, the public must\\nalways be a loser by the \\xef\\xbf\\xbdFarzah.\\' Two of a trade do not agree\\nelsewhere; but at Suez even the Christian and the Moslem shipowner are\\nbound by a fraternal tie, in the shape of this rotation system. It\\ninjures the general merchant and the Red Sea trader, not only by\\n</p><p>[p.171] perpetuating high freight,[FN#11] but also by causing at one\\nperiod of the year a break in the routine of sales and in the supplies\\nof goods for the great Jeddah market.[FN#12] At this moment (Nov.\\n1853), the vessel to which the turn belongs happens to be a large one;\\nthere is a deficiency of export to Al-Hijaz,-her owner will of course\\nwait any length of time for a full cargo; consequently no vessel with\\nmerchandise has left Suez for the last seventy-two days. Those who have\\nbought goods for the Jeddah market at three months\\' credit will\\ntherefore have to meet their acceptances for merchandise still\\nwarehoused at the Egyptian port. This strange contrast to free-trade\\nprinciple is another proof that protection benefits only one party, the\\nprotected, while it is detrimental to the interests of the other party,\\nthe public.\" To these remarks of Mr. Levick\\'s, I have only to add that\\nthe government supports the Farzah with all the energy of\\nprotectionists. A letter from Mr. (now Sir) John Drummond Hay was\\ninsufficient to induce the Bey of Suez to break through the rule of\\nrotation in favour of certain princes from Morocco. The recommendations\\nof Lord Stratford de Redcliffe met with no better fate; and all Mr.\\nWest\\'s good will could not procure\\n</p><p>[p.172]me a vessel out of her turn.[FN#13] We were forced to rely upon\\nour own exertions, and the activity of Sa\\'ad the Demon. This worthy,\\nafter sundry delays and differences, mostly caused by his own\\ndetermination to travel gratis, and to make us pay too much, finally\\nclosed with the owner of the \"Golden Thread.[FN#14]\" He took places for\\nus upon the poop,-the most eligible part of the vessel at this season\\nof the year; he premised that we should not be very comfortable, as we\\nwere to be crowded with Maghrabi pilgrims, but that \"Allah makes all\\nthings easy!\" Though not penetrated with the conviction that this would\\nhappen in our case, I paid for two deck passages eighteen Riyals[FN#15]\\n(dollars), and my companions seven each, whilst Sa\\'ad secretly entered\\nhimself as an able seaman. Mohammed Shiklibha we were obliged to leave\\nbehind, as he could not, or might not afford the expense, and none of\\nus might afford it for him. Had I known him to be the honest,\\ntrue-hearted fellow he was-his kindness at Meccah quite won my heart-I\\nshould not have grudged the small charity.\\n</p><p>[p.173]Nothing more comfortless than our days and nights in the\\n\"George\" Inn. The ragged walls of our rooms were clammy with dirt, the\\nsmoky rafters foul with cobwebs, and the floor, bestrewed with kit, in\\nterrible confusion, was black with hosts of cockroaches, ants, and\\nflies. Pigeons nestled on the shelf, cooing amatory ditties the\\nlive-long day, and cats like tigers crawled through a hole in the door,\\nmaking night hideous with their caterwaulings. Now a curious goat, then\\nan inquisitive jackass, would walk stealthily into the room, remark\\nthat it was tenanted, and retreat with dignified demeanour, and the\\nmosquitos sang Io Paeans over our prostrate forms throughout the\\ntwenty-four hours. I spare the reader the enumeration of the other\\nEgyptian plagues that infested the place. After the first day\\'s trial,\\nwe determined to spend the hours of light in the passages, lying upon\\nour boxes or rugs, smoking, wrangling, and inspecting one another\\'s\\nchests. The latter occupation was a fertile source of disputes, for\\nnothing was more common than for a friend to seize an article belonging\\nto another, and to swear by the Apostle\\'s beard that he admired it,\\nand, therefore, would not return it. The boy Mohammed and Shaykh Nur,\\nwho had been intimates the first day, differed in opinion on the\\nsecond, and on the third came to pushing each other against the wall.\\nSometimes we went into the Bazar, a shady street flanked with poor\\nlittle shops, or we sat in the coffee-house,[FN#16] drinking hot\\nsaltish water tinged with burnt bean, or we prayed in one of three\\ntumble-down old Mosques, or we squatted upon the pier, lamenting the\\nwant of Hammams, and bathing in the tepid sea.[FN#17] I presently came\\nto the conclusion that\\n</p><p>[p.174]Suez as a \"watering-place\" is duller even than Dover. The only\\nsociety we found, excepting an occasional visitor, was that of a party\\nof Egyptian women, who with their husbands and families occupied some\\nrooms adjoining ours. At first they were fierce, and used bad language,\\nwhen the boy Mohammed and I,-whilst Omar Effendi was engaged in prayer,\\nand the rest were wandering about the town,-ventured to linger in the\\ncool passage, where they congregated, or to address a facetious phrase\\nto them. But hearing that I was a Hakim-bashi-for fame had promoted me\\nto the rank of a \"Physician General\" at Suez-all discovered some\\nailments. They began prudently with requesting me to display the\\neffects of my drugs by dosing myself, but they ended submissively by\\nswallowing the nauseous compounds. To this succeeded a primitive form\\nof flirtation, which mainly consisted of the demand direct. The most\\ncharming of the party was one Fattumah[FN#18], a plump-personed dame,\\nfast verging upon her thirtieth year, fond of a little flattery, and\\npossessing, like all her people, a most voluble tongue. The refrain of\\nevery conversation was \"Marry me, O Fattumah! O daughter! O female\\npilgrim!\" In vain the lady would reply, with a coquettish movement of\\nthe sides, a toss of the head, and a flirting manipulation of her\\nhead-veil,\\n</p><p>[p.175]\"I am mated, O young man!\"-it was agreed that she, being a\\nperson of polyandrous propensities, could support the weight of at\\nleast three matrimonial engagements. Sometimes the entrance of the male\\nFellahs[FN#19] interrupted these little discussions, but people of our\\nrespectability and nation were not to be imposed upon by such husbands.\\nIn their presence we only varied the style of conversation-inquiring\\nthe amount of \"Mahr,\" or marriage settlement, deriding the cheapness of\\nwomanhood in Egypt, and requiring to be furnished on the spot with\\nbrides at the rate of ten shillings a head.[FN#20] More often the\\namiable Fattumah-the fair sex in this country, though passing frail,\\nhave the best tempers in the world-would laugh at our impertinences.\\nSometimes vexed by our imitating her Egyptian accent, mimicking her\\ngestures, and depreciating her country-women,[FN#21] she would wax\\nwroth, and order us to be gone, and stretch out her forefinger-a sign\\nthat she wished to put out our eyes, or adjure Allah to cut the hearts\\nout of our bosoms. Then\\n</p><p>[p.176]the \"Marry me, O Fattumah, O daughter, O female pilgrim!\" would\\ngive way to Y\\'al Ago-o-oz! (O old woman and decrepit!) \"O daughter of\\nsixty sires, and fit only to carry wood to market!\"-whereupon would\\nburst a storm of wrath, at the tail of which all of us, like children,\\nstarting upon our feet, rushed out of one another\\'s way. But-\"qui se\\ndispute, s\\'adore\"-when we again met all would be forgotten, and the old\\ntale be told over de novo. This was the amusement of the day. At night\\nwe men, assembling upon the little terrace, drank tea, recited stories,\\nread books, talked of our travels, and indulged in various\\npleasantries. The great joke was the boy Mohammed\\'s abusing all his\\ncompanions to their faces in Hindustani, which none but Shaykh Nur and\\nI could understand; the others, however, guessed his intention, and\\nrevenged themselves by retorts of the style uncourteous in the purest\\nHijazi.\\n</p><p>I proceed to offer a few more extracts from Mr. Levick\\'s letter about\\nSuez and the Suezians. \"It appears that the number of pilgrims who pass\\nthrough Suez to Meccah has of late been steadily on the decrease. When\\nI first came here (in 1838) the pilgrims who annually embarked at this\\nport amounted to between 10,000 and 12,000, the shipping was more\\nnumerous, and the merchants were more affluent.[FN#22] I have\\nascertained from a special register kept in the government archives\\nthat in the Moslem year 1268 (A.D. 1851-52) the exact number that\\npassed through was 4893.\"\\n</p><p>\"In 1269 A.H. (A.D. 1852-53) it had shrunk to 3136. The natives assign\\nthe falling off to various causes, which\\n[p.177]I attribute chiefly to the indirect effect of European\\ncivilisation upon the Moslem powers immediately in contact with it. The\\nheterogeneous mass of pilgrims is composed of people of all classes,\\ncolours, and costumes. One sees among them, not only the natives of\\ncountries contiguous to Egypt, but also a large proportion of Central\\nAsians from Bokhara, Persia, Circassia, Turkey, and the Crimea, who\\nprefer this route by way of Constantinople to the difficult, expensive\\nand dangerous caravan-line through the Desert from Damascus and\\nBaghdad. The West sends us Moors, Algerines, and Tunisians, and Inner\\nAfrica a mass of sable Takrouri,[FN#23] and others from Bornou, the\\nSudan,[FN#24] Ghadamah near the Niger, and Jabarti from the\\nHabash.[FN#25]\"\\n</p><p>\"The Suez ship-builders are an influential body of men, originally\\nCandiots and Alexandrians. When Mohammed Ali fitted out his fleet for\\nthe Hijaz war, he transported a number of Greeks to Suez, and the\\nchildren now exercise their fathers\\' craft. There are at present three\\ngreat builders at this place. Their principal difficulty\\n</p><p>[p.178]is the want of material. Teak comes from India[FN#26] via\\nJeddah, and Venetian boards, owing to the expense of camel-transport,\\nare a hundred per cent. dearer here than at Alexandria. Trieste and\\nTurkey supply spars, and Jeddah canvas: the sail-makers are Suez men,\\nand the crews a mongrel mixture of Arabs and Egyptians; the Rais, or\\ncaptain, being almost invariably, if the vessel be a large one, a\\nYambu\\' man. There are two kinds of craft, distinguished from each other\\nby tonnage, not by build. The Baghlah[FN#27] (buggalow), is a vessel\\nabove fifty tons burden, the Sambuk (a classical term) from fifteen to\\nfifty. The shipowner bribes the Amir al-Bahr, or port-captain, and the\\nNazir al-Safayn, or the captain commanding the government vessels, to\\nrate his ship as high as possible; if he pay the price, he will be\\nallowed nine ardebs to the ton.[FN#28] The number of ships belonging to\\nthe port of Suez amounts to 92; they vary from 25 to 250 tons. The\\ndepartures in A.H. 1269 (1852 and 1853) were 38, so that each vessel,\\nafter returning from a trip, is laid up for about two years. Throughout\\nthe passage of the pilgrims,-that is to say, during four months,-the\\ndepartures average twice a week; during the remainder of the year from\\nsix to ten vessels may leave the port. The homeward trade is carried on\\nprincipally in Jeddah bottoms, which are allowed to convey goods to\\nSuez, but not to take in return cargo there: they must not interfere\\nwith, nor may they partake in any way of the benefits of the rotation\\nsystem.[FN#29]\"\\n</p><p>[p.179]\"During the present year the imports were contained in 41,395\\npackages, the exports in 15,988. Specie makes up in some manner for\\nthis preponderance of imports: a sum of from L30,000 to L40,000, in\\ncrown, or Maria Theresa, dollars annually leaves Egypt for Arabia,\\nAbyssinia, and other parts of Africa. I value the imports at about\\nL350,000; the export trade to Jeddah at L300,000 per annum. The former\\nconsists principally of coffee and gum-arabic; of these there were\\nrespectively 17,460 and 15,132 bales, the aggregate value of each\\narticle being from L75,000 to L80,000, and the total amount L160,000.\\nIn the previous year the imports were contained in 36,840 packages, the\\nexports in 13,498: of the staple articles-coffee and gum-arabic-they\\nwere respectively 15,499 and 14,129 bales, each bale being valued at\\nabout L5. Next in importance comes wax from Al-Yaman and the Hijaz,\\nmother-of-pearl[FN#30] from the Red Sea, sent to England in rough,\\npepper from Malabar, cloves brought by Moslem pilgrims from Java,\\nBorneo, and Singapore,[FN#31] cherry pipe-sticks from Persia and\\nBussora, and Persian or Surat \\xef\\xbf\\xbdTimbak\\' (tobacco). These I value at\\nL20,000 per annum. There were also (A.D. 1853) of cloves 708 packages,\\nand of Malabar pepper 948: the cost of these two might be L7,000. Minor\\narticles of exportation are,-general spiceries (ginger, cardamons,\\n</p><p>[p.180] &amp;c.); Eastern perfumes, such as aloes-wood, attar of rose,\\nattar of pink and others; tamarinds from India and Al-Yaman, Banca tin,\\nhides supplied by the nomade Badawin, senna leaves from Al-Yaman and\\nthe Hijaz, and blue chequered cotton Malayahs (women\\'s mantillas),\\nmanufactured in southern Arabia. The total value of these smaller\\nimports may be L20,000 per annum.\"\\n</p><p>\"The exports chiefly consist of English and native \\xef\\xbf\\xbdgrey domestics,\\'\\nbleached Madipilams, Paisley lappets, and muslins for turbands; the\\nremainder being Manchester prints, antimony, Syrian soap, iron in bars,\\nand common ironmongery, Venetian or Trieste beads, used as ornaments in\\nArabia and Abyssinia, writing paper, Tarbushes, Papushes (slippers),\\nand other minor articles of dress and ornament.\"\\n</p><p>\"The average annual temperature of the year at Suez is 67\\xef\\xbf\\xbd Fahrenheit.\\nThe extremes of heat and cold are found in January and August; during\\nthe former month the thermometer ranges from a minimum of 38\\xef\\xbf\\xbd to a\\nmaximum of 68\\xef\\xbf\\xbd; during the latter the variation extends from 68\\xef\\xbf\\xbd to\\n102\\xef\\xbf\\xbd, or even to 104\\xef\\xbf\\xbd, when the heat becomes oppressive. Departures\\nfrom these extremes are rare. I never remember to have seen the\\nthermometer rise above 108\\xef\\xbf\\xbd during the severest Khamsin, or to have\\nsunk below 34\\xef\\xbf\\xbd in the rawest wintry wind. Violent storms come up from\\nthe south in March. Rain is very variable[FN#32]:\\n</p><p>[p.181] sometimes three years have passed without a shower, whereas in\\n1841 torrents poured for nine successive days, deluging the town, and\\ncausing many buildings to fall.\"\\n</p><p>\"The population of Suez now numbers about 4,800. As usual in Mohammedan\\ncountries no census is taken here. Some therefore estimate the\\npopulation at 6,000. Sixteen years ago it was supposed to be under\\n3,000. After that time it rapidly increased till 1850, when a fatal\\nattack of cholera reduced it to about half its previous number. The\\naverage mortality is about twelve a month.[FN#33] The endemic diseases\\nare fevers of typhoid and intermittent types in spring, when strong\\nnortherly winds cause the waters of the bay to recede,[FN#34] and leave\\na miasma-breeding swamp exposed to the rays of the sun. In the months\\nof October and November febrile attacks are violent; ophthalmia more\\nso. The eye-disease is not so general here as at Cairo, but the\\nsymptoms are more acute; in some years it becomes a virulent epidemic,\\nwhich ends either in total blindness or in a partial opacity of the\\ncornea, inducing dimness of vision, and a permanent weakness of the\\neyes. In one month three of my acquaintances lost their sight.\\nDysenteries are also common, and so are bad boils, or rather ulcers.\\nThe cold season is not unwholesome, and at this period the\\n</p><p>[p.182] pure air of the Desert restores and invigorates the heat-wasted\\nframe.\"\\n</p><p>\"The walls, gates, and defences of Suez are in a ruinous state, being\\nno longer wanted to keep out the Sinaitic Badawin. The houses are about\\n500 in number, but many of the natives prefer occupying the upper\\nstories of the Wakalahs, the rooms on the ground floor serving for\\nstores to certain merchandise, wood, dates, cotton, &amp;c. The Suezians\\nlive well, and their bazar is abundantly stocked with meat and\\nclarified butter brought from Sinai, and fowls, corn, and vegetables\\nfrom the Sharkiyah province; fruit is supplied by Cairo as well as by\\nthe Sharkiyah, and wheat conveyed down the Nile in flood to the capital\\nis carried on camel-back across the Desert. At sunrise they eat the\\nFatur, or breakfast, which in summer consists of a \\xef\\xbf\\xbdfatirah,\\' a kind of\\nmuffin, or of bread and treacle. In winter it is more substantial,\\nbeing generally a mixture of lentils and rice,[FN#35] with clarified\\nbutter poured over it, and a \\xef\\xbf\\xbdkitchen\\' of pickled lime or stewed\\nonions. At this season they greatly enjoy the \\xef\\xbf\\xbdful mudammas\\' (boiled\\nhorse-beans),[FN#36] eaten with an abundance of linseed oil, into which\\nthey steep bits of bread. The beans form, with carbon-generating\\nmatter, a highly nutritive diet, which, if the stomach can digest\\nit,-the pulse is never shelled,-gives great strength. About the middle\\nof the day comes \\xef\\xbf\\xbdAl-Ghada,\\' a light dinner of wheaten bread, with\\ndates, onions or cheese: in the hot season melons and cooling\\n</p><p>[p.183] fruits are preferred, especially by those who have to face the\\nsun. \\xef\\xbf\\xbdAl-Asha,\\' or supper, is served about half an hour after sunset;\\nat this meal all but the poorest classes eat meat. Their favourite\\nflesh, as usual in this part of the world, is mutton; beef and goat are\\nlittle prized.[FN#37]\"\\n</p><p>The people of Suez are a finer and fairer race than the Cairenes. The\\nformer have more the appearance of Arabs: their dress is more\\npicturesque, their eyes are carefully darkened with Kohl, and they wear\\nsandals, not slippers. They are, according to all accounts, a turbulent\\nand somewhat fanatic set, fond of quarrels, and slightly addicted to\\n\"pronunciamentos.\" The general programme of one of these latter\\ndiversions is said to be as follows. The boys will first be sent by\\ntheir fathers about the town in a disorderly mob, and ordered to cry\\nout \"Long live the Sultan!\" with its usual sequel, \"Death to the\\nInfidels!\" The Infidels, Christians or others, must hear and may happen\\nto resent this; or possibly the governor, foreseeing a disturbance,\\norders an ingenuous youth or two to be imprisoned, or to be caned by\\nthe police. Whereupon some person, rendered influential by wealth or\\nreligious reputation, publicly complains that the Christians are all in\\nall, and that in these evil days Al-Islam is going to destruction. On\\nthis occasion the speaker conducts himself with such insolence, that\\nthe governor perforce consigns him to confinement, which exasperates\\nthe populace still more. Secret meetings are now convened, and in them\\nthe chiefs of corporations assume a prominent position. If the\\ndisturbance be intended by its main-spring to subside quietly, the\\nconspirators are allowed to take their own way; they will drink\\ncopiously, become lions about midnight, and recover their hare-hearts\\nbefore noon next\\n</p><p>[p.184] day. But if mischief be intended, a case of bloodshed is\\nbrought about, and then nothing can arrest the torrent of popular\\nrage.[FN#38] The Egyptian, with all his good humour, merriment, and\\nnonchalance, is notorious for doggedness, when, as the popular phrase\\nis, his \"blood is up.\" And this, indeed, is his chief merit as a\\nsoldier. He has a certain mechanical dexterity in the use of arms, and\\nan Egyptian regiment will fire a volley as correctly as a battalion at\\nChobham. But when the head, and not the hands, is required, he notably\\nfails. The reason of his superiority in the field is his peculiar\\nstubborness, and this, together with his powers of digestion and of\\nenduring hardship on the line of march, is the quality that makes him\\nterrible to his old conqueror, the Turk.[FN#39]\\n</p><p>[FN#1] When travelling, the Shushah is allowed to spread over the\\ngreatest portion of the scalp, to act as a protection against the sun;\\nand the hair being shaved off about two inches all round the head,\\nleaves a large circular patch. Nothing can be uglier than such tonsure,\\nand it is contrary to the strict law of the Apostle, who ordered a\\nclean shave, or a general growth of the hair. The Arab, however, knows\\nby experience, that though habitual exposure of the scalp to a burning\\nsun may harden the skull, it seldom fails to damage its precious\\ncontents. He, therefore, wears a Shushah during his wanderings, and\\nremoves it on his return home. Abu Hanifah, if I am rightly informed,\\nwrote a treatise advocating the growth of a long lock of hair on the\\nNasiyah, or crown of the head, lest the decapitated Moslem\\'s mouth or\\nbeard be exposed to defilement by an impure hand. This would justify\\nthe comparing it to the \"chivalry-lock,\" by which the American brave\\nfacilitates the removal of his own scalp. But I am at a loss to\\ndiscover the origin of our old idea, that the \"angel of death will, on\\nthe last day, bear all true believers, by this important tuft of hair\\non the crown, to Paradise.\" Probably this office has been attributed to\\nthe Shushah by the ignorance of the West.\\n[FN#2] \"Makhi-chus,\" equivalent to our \"skin-flint.\"\\n[FN#3] A well-known Arab chieftain, whose name has come to stand for\\ngenerosity itself.\\n[FN#4] This being an indispensable instrument for measuring distances,\\nI had it divested of gold case, and provided with a facing carefully\\nstained and figured with Arabic numerals. In countries where few can\\njudge of a watch by its works, it is as well to secure its safety by\\nmaking the exterior look as mean as possible. The watches worn by\\nrespectable people in Al-Hijaz are almost a1ways old silver pieces, of\\nthe turnip shape, with hunting cases and an outer etui of thick\\nleather. Mostly they are of Swiss or German manufacture, and they find\\ntheir way into Arabia via Constantinople and Cairo.\\n[FN#5] On my return to Cairo, Omar Effendi, whom I met accidentally in\\nthe streets, related the story to me. I never owned having played a\\npart, to avoid shocking his prejudices; and though he must have\\nsuspected me,-for the general report was, that an Englishman, disguised\\nas a Persian, had performed the pilgrimage, measured the country, and\\nsketched the buildings,-he had the gentlemanly feeling never to allude\\nto the past. We parted, when I went to India, on the best of terms.\\n[FN#6] Munkati\\'a-one cut off (from the pleasures and comforts of life).\\nIn Al-Hijaz, as in England, any allusion to poverty is highly offensive.\\n[FN#7] The Koran expressly forbids a Moslem to discredit the word of\\nany man who professes his belief in the Saving Faith. The greatest\\noffence of the Wahhabis is their habit of designating all Moslems that\\nbelong to any but their own sect by the opprobrious name of Kafirs or\\ninfidels. This, however, is only the Koranic precept; in practice a\\nmuch less trustful spirit prevails.\\n[FN#8] Towards the end of the season, poor pilgrims are forwarded\\ngratis, by order of government. But, to make such liberality as\\ninexpensive as possible, the Pasha compels ship-owners to carry one\\npilgrim per 9 ardebs (about 5 bushels each), in small, and 1 per 11 in\\nlarge vessels.\\n[FN#9] I was informed by a Prussian gentleman, holding an official\\nappointment under His Highness the Pasha, at Cairo, that 300,000 ardebs\\nof grain were annually exported from Kusayr to Jeddah. The rest is\\nbrought down the Nile for consumption in Lower Egypt, and export to\\nEurope.\\n[FN#10] The account here offered to the reader was kindly supplied to\\nme by Henry Levick, Esq. (late Vice-Consul, and afterwards Post-master\\nat Suez), and it may be depended upon, as coming from a resident of 16\\nyears\\' standing. All the passages marked with inverted commas are\\nextracts from a letter with which that gentleman favoured me. The\\ninformation is obsolete now, but it may be interesting as a specimen of\\nthe things that were.\\n[FN#11] The rate of freight is at present (1853) about forty shillings\\nper ton-very near the same paid by the P. and O. Company for coals\\ncarried from Newcastle via the Cape to Suez. Were the \"Farzah\"\\nabolished, freight to Jeddah would speedily fall to 15 or 16 shillings\\nper ton. Passengers from Suez to Jeddah are sometimes charged as much\\nas 6 or even 8 dollars for standing room-personal baggage forming\\nanother pretext for extortion-and the higher orders of pilgrims,\\noccupying a small portion of the cabin, pay about 12 dollars. These\\nfirst and second class fares would speedily be reduced, by abolishing\\nprotection, to 3 and 6 dollars. Note to Second Edition.-The \"Farzah,\" I\\nmay here observe, has been abolished by Sa\\'id Pasha since the\\npublication of these lines: the effects of \"free trade\" are exactly\\nwhat were predicted by Mr. Levick.\\n[FN#12] The principal trade from Suez is to Jeddah, Kusayr supplying\\nYambu\\'. The latter place, however, imports from Suez wheat, beans,\\ncheese, biscuit, and other provisions for return pilgrims.\\n[FN#13] My friends were strenuous in their exertions for me to make\\ninterest with Mr. West. In the first place, we should have paid less\\nfor the whole of a privileged vessel, than we did for our wretched\\nquarters on the deck of the pilgrim-ship; and, secondly, we might have\\ntouched at any port we pleased, so as to do a little business in the\\nway of commerce.\\n[FN#14] Afterwards called by Sir R. F. Burton the \"Golden Wire.\"-ED.\\n[FN#15] For the \"Sath,\" or poop, the sum paid by each was seven Riyals.\\nI was, therefore, notably cheated by Sa\\'ad the Demon. The unhappy women\\nin the \"Kamrah,\" or cabin, bought suffocation at the rate of 6 dollars\\neach, as I was afterwards informed, and the third class, in the \"Taht,\"\\nor amidships and forward, contributed from 3 to 5 Riyals. But, as usua1\\non these occasions, there was no prix fixe; every man was either\\novercharged or undercharged, according to his means or his necessities.\\nWe had to purchase our own water, but the ship was to supply us with\\nfuel for cooking. We paid nothing extra for luggage, and we carried an\\nold Maghrabi woman gratis for good luck.\\n[FN#16] We were still at Suez, where we could do as we pleased. But\\nrespectable Arabs in their own country, unlike Egyptians, are seldom to\\nbe seen in the places of public resort. \"Go to the coffee-house and\\nsing there!\" is a reproach sometimes addressed to those who have a\\nhabit of humming in decent society.\\n[FN#17] It was only my prestige as physician that persuaded my friend\\nto join me in these bathings. As a general rule, the Western Arabs\\navoid cold water, from a belief that it causes fever. When Mr. C. Cole,\\nH.B.M.\\'s Vice-Consul, arrived at Jeddah, the people of the place,\\nseeing that he kept up his Indian habits, advised him strongly to drop\\nthem. He refused; but unhappily he soon caught a fever, which confirmed\\nthem all in their belief. When Arabs wish to cool the skin after a\\njourney, they wash with a kind of fuller\\'s earth called \"Tafl,\" or with\\na thin paste of henna, and then anoint the body with oil or butter.\\n[FN#18] An incrementative form of the name \"Fatimah,\" very common in\\nEgypt. Fatimah would mean a \"weaner\"-Fattumah, a \"great weaner.\" By the\\nsame barbarism Khadijah becomes \"Khaddugah\"; Aminah, \"Ammunah\"; and\\nNafisah, \"Naffusah,\" on the banks of the Nile.\\n[FN#19] The palmy days of the Egyptian husband, when he might use the\\nstick, the sword, or the sack with impunity, are, in civilised places\\nat least, now gone by. The wife has only to complain to the Kazi, or to\\nthe governor, and she is certain of redress. This is right in the\\nabstract, but in practice it acts badly. The fair sex is so unruly in\\nthis country, that strong measures are necessary to coerce it, and in\\nthe arts of deceit men have here little or no chance against women.\\n[FN#20] The amount of settlement being, among Moslems as among\\nChristians, the test of a bride\\'s value,-moral and physical,-it will\\nreadily be understood that our demand was more facetious than\\ncomplimentary.\\n[FN#21] The term Misriyah (an Egyptian woman) means in Al-Hijaz and the\\ncountries about it, a depraved character. Even the men own unwillingly\\nto being Egyptians, for the free-born never forget that the banks of\\nthe Nile have for centuries been ruled by the slaves of slaves. \"He\\nshall be called an Egyptian,\" is a denunciation which has been\\nstrikingly fulfilled, though the country be no longer the \"basest of\\nkingdoms.\"\\n[FN#22] In those days merchants depended solely upon the native trade\\nand the passage of pilgrims. The pecuniary advantage attending what is\\ncalled the Overland transit benefits chiefly the lowest orders,\\ncamel-men, sailors, porters, and others of the same class. Sixteen\\nyears ago the hire of a boat from the harbour to the roadstead was a\\npiastre and a half: now it is at least five.\\n[FN#23] This word, says Mansfield Parkyns (Life in Abyssinia), is\\napplied to the wandering pilgrim from Darfur, Dar Borghu, Bayarimah,\\nFellatah, and Western Africa. He mentions, however, a tribe called\\n\"Tokrouri,\" settled in Abyssinia near Nimr\\'s country, but he does not\\nappear to know that the ancient Arab settlement in Western Africa,\\n\"Al-Takrur,\" (Sakatu?) which has handed down its name to a large\\nposterity of small kingdoms, will be found in Al-Idrisi (1. climate, 1.\\nsection,); but I do not agree with the learned translator in writing\\nthe word \"Tokrour.\" Burckhardt often alludes in his benevolent way to\\nthe \"respectable and industrious Tekrourys.\" I shall have occasion to\\nmention them at a future time.\\n[FN#24] The Sudan (Blackland) in Arabia is applied to Upper Nubia,\\nSenaar, Kordofan, and the parts adjacent.\\n[FN#25] Not only in Ghiz, but also in Arabic, the mother of Ghiz, the\\nword \"Habash,\" whence our \"Abyssinians,\" means a rabble, a mixture of\\npeople. Abyssinian Moslems are called by the Arabs \"Jabarti.\"\\n[FN#26] There is no such thing as a tree, except the date, the\\ntamarisk, and the mimosa on the western shores of the Red Sea.\\n[FN#27] This word, which in Arabic is the feminine form of \"Baghl,\" a\\nmule, is in Egypt, as in India, pronounced and written by foreigners\\n\"buggalow.\" Some worthy Anglo-Indians have further corrupted it to\\n\"bungalow.\"\\n[FN#28] \"The ardeb, like most measures in this country of commercial\\nconfusion, varies greatly according to the grain for which it is used.\\nAs a general rule, it may be assumed at 300 lbs.\"\\n[FN#29] Return Arab boats, at any but the pilgrim season, with little\\ndifficulty obtain permission to carry passengers, but not cargo. Two\\ngentlemen, in whose pleasant society I once travelled from Cairo to\\nSuez,-M. Charles Didier and the Abbe Hamilton,-paid the small sum of\\n1000 piastres, (say L10) for the whole of a moderate sized \"Sambuk\"\\nreturning to Jeddah.\\n[FN#30] Mother-of-pearl is taken to Jerusalem, and there made into\\nchaplets, saints\\' figures, and crucifixes for Christian pilgrims. At\\nMeccah it is worked into rosaries for the Hajis. In Europe, cabinet and\\nornamental work cause a considerable demand for it. Some good pearls\\nare procurable in the Red Sea. I have seen a drop of fair size and\\ncolour sold for seven dollars.\\n[FN#31] I was told at Meccah that the pilgrimage is attended by about\\n2000 natives of Java and the adjoining islands.\\n[FN#32] The following popular puerilities will serve to show how fond\\nbarbarians are of explaining the natural by the supernatural. The\\nMoslems of Egypt thus account for the absence of St. Swithin from their\\ndrought-stricken lands. When Jacob lost his Benjamin, he cursed the\\nland of Misraim, declaring that it should know no rain; Joseph on the\\nother hand blessed it, asserting that it should never want water. So\\nthe Sind Hindus believe that Hiranyakasipu, the demon-tyrant of Multan,\\nfinding Magha-Raja (the Cloud King) troublesome in his dominions, bound\\nhim with chains, and only released him upon his oath not to trouble the\\nUnhappy Valley with his presence. I would suggest to those Egyptian\\ntravellers who believe that the fall of rain has been materially\\nincreased at Cairo of late, by plantations of trees, to turn over the\\nvolumes of their predecesors; they will find almost every one\\ncomplaining of the discomforts of rain. In Sind it appears certain that\\nduring the last few years there has been at times almost a monsoon;\\nthis novel phenomenon the natives attribute to the presence of their\\nconquerors, concerning whom it cannot be said that they have wooded the\\ncountry to any extent.\\n[FN#33] This may appear a large mortality; but at Alexandria it is said\\nthe population is renewed every fourteen years.\\n[FN#34] During these North winds the sandy bar is exposed, and allows\\nmen to cross, which may explain the passage of the Israelites, for\\nthose who do not believe the Legend to be a Myth. Similarly at Jeddah,\\nthe bars are covered during the South and bare during the North winds.\\n[FN#35] This mixture, called in India Kichhri, has become common in\\nAl-Hijaz as well as at Suez. \"Al-Kajari\" is the corruption, which\\ndenotes its foreign origin, and renders its name pronounceable to Arabs.\\n[FN#36] Beans, an abomination to the ancient Egyptians, who were\\nforbidden even to sow them, may now be called the common \"kitchen\" of\\nthe country. The Badawin, ho believe in nothing but flesh, milk, and\\ndates, deride the bean-eaters, but they do not consider the food so\\ndisgusting as onions.\\n[FN#37] Here concludes Mr. Levick\\'s letter. For the following\\nobservations, I alone am answerable.\\n[FN#38] The government takes care to prevent bloodshed in the towns by\\ndisarming the country people, and by positively forbidding the carrying\\nof weapons. Moreover, with a wise severity, it punishes all parties\\nconcerned in a quarrel, where blood is drawn, with a heavy fine and the\\nbastinado de rigueur. Hence it is never safe, except as a European, to\\nstrike a man, and the Egyptians generally confine themselves to\\ncollaring and pushing each other against the walls. Even in the case of\\nreceiving gross abuse, you cannot notice it as you would elsewhere. You\\nmust take two witnesses,-respectable men,-and prove the offence before\\nthe Zabit, who alone can punish the offender.\\n[FN#39] NOTE TO THIRD (1873) EDITION.-I revisited Suez in September,\\n1869, and found it altered for the better. The population had risen\\nfrom 6,000 to 20,000. The tumble-down gateway was still there, but of\\nthe old houses-including the \"George Inn,\" whose front had been\\nrepaired-I recognised only four, and they looked mean by the side of\\nthe fine new buildings. In a few years ancient Suez will be no more.\\nThe bazars are not so full of filth and flies, now that pilgrims pass\\nstraight through and hardly even encamp. The sweet water Canal renders\\na Hammam possible; coffee is no longer hot saltish water, and presently\\nirrigation will cover with fields and gardens the desert plain\\nextending to the feet of Jabal Atakah. The noble works of the Canal\\nMaritime, which should in justice be called the \"Lesseps Canal,\" shall\\nsoon transform Clysma into a modern and civilised city. The railway\\nstation, close to the hotel, the new British hospital, the noisy Greek\\ncasino, the Frankish shops, the puffing steamers, and the ringing of\\nmorning bells, gave me a novel impression. Even the climate has been\\nchanged by filling up the Timsch Lakes. Briefly, the hat is now at home\\nin Suez.\\nNOTE TO FOURTH (1879) EDITION.-The forecast in the last paragraph has\\nnot been fulfilled. I again visited Suez in 1877-78; and found that it\\nhad been ruined by the Canal leaving it out of line. In fact, another\\nSuez is growing up about the \"New Docks,\" while the old town is falling\\nto pieces. For this and other Egyptian matters, see \"The Gold Mines of\\nMidian\" (by Sir Richard Burton).\\n</p>\\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Chapter_X._THE_PILGRIM_SHIP.\">Chapter X.

To confound confusion, the\\nboatmen have moored their skiff half a dozen yards away from the shore,\\nlest the porters should be unable to make more than double their fare\\nfrom the Hajis. Again the Turkish women make a hideous noise, as they\\nare carried off struggling vainly in brawny arms; the children howl\\nbecause their mothers howl; and the men scold and swear, because in\\nsuch scenes none may be silent. The moment we had embarked, each\\nindividual found that he or she had missed something of vital\\nimportance,-a pipe, a child, a box, or a water-melon; and naturally all\\nthe servants were in the bazars, when\\n</p><p>[p.187] they should have been in the boat. Briefly, despite the rage of\\nthe sailors, who feared being too late for a second trip, we stood for\\nsome time on the beach before putting off.\\n</p><p>&gt;From the shore we poled to the little pier, where sat the Bey in\\nperson to perform a final examination of our passports. Several were\\ndetected without the necessary document. Some were bastinadoed, others\\nwere peremptorily ordered back to Cairo, and the rest were allowed to\\nproceed. At about 10 A.M. (6th July) we hoisted sail, and ran down the\\nchannel leading to the roadstead. On our way we had a specimen of what\\nwe might expect from our fellow-passengers, the Maghrabi.[FN#1] A boat\\ncrowded with these\\n</p><p>[p.188] ruffians ran alongside of us, and, before we could organise a\\ndefence, about a score of them poured into our vessel. They carried\\nthings too with a high hand, laughed at us, and seemed quite ready to\\nfight. My Indian boy, who happened to let slip the word \"Muarras,\"\\nnarrowly escaped a blow with a palm stick, which would have felled a\\ncamel. They outnumbered us, and they were armed; so that, on this\\noccasion, we were obliged to put up with their insolence.\\n</p><p>Our Pilgrim Ship, the Silk al-Zahab, or the \"Golden Wire,\" was a\\nSambuk, of about 400 ardebs (fifty tons), with narrow, wedge-like bows,\\na clean water-line, a sharp keel, and undecked, except upon the poop,\\nwhich was high enough to act as a sail in a gale of wind. She carried\\ntwo masts, raking imminently forwards, the main being considerably\\nlarger than the mizzen; the former was provided with a huge triangular\\nlatine, very deep in the tack, but the second sail was unaccountably\\nwanting. She had no means of reefing, no compass, no log, no sounding\\nlines, no spare ropes, nor even the suspicion of a chart: in her\\nbox-like cabin and ribbed hold there was something which savoured of\\nclose connection between her model and that of the Indian Toni,[FN#2]\\nor \"dug-out.\"\\n</p><p>[p.189] Such, probably, were the craft which carried old Sesostris\\nacross the Red Sea to Deir; such were the cruisers which once every\\nthree years left Ezion-Geber for Tarshish; such the transports of which\\n130 were required to convey AElius Gallus, with his 10,000 men.\\n\"Bakhshish\" was the last as well as the first odious sound I heard in\\nEgypt. The owner of the shore-boat would not allow us to climb the\\nsides of our vessel before paying him his fare, and when we did so, he\\nasked for Bakhshish. If Easterns would only imitate the example of\\nEuropeans,-I never yet saw an Englishman give Bakhshish to a soul,-the\\nnuisance would soon be done away with. But on this occasion all my\\ncompanions complied with the request, and at times it is unpleasant to\\nbe singular. The first look at the interior of our vessel showed a\\nhopeless sight; Ali Murad, the greedy owner, had promised to take sixty\\npassengers in the hold, but had stretched the number to ninety-seven.\\nPiles of boxes and luggage in every shape and form filled the ship from\\nstem to stern, and a torrent of Hajis were pouring over the sides like\\nants into the East-Indian sugar-basin. The poop, too, where we had\\ntaken our places, was covered with goods, and a number of pilgrims had\\nestablished themselves there by might, not by right.\\n</p><p>Presently, to our satisfaction, appeared Sa\\'ad the Demon, equipped as\\nan able seaman, and looking most unlike the proprietor of two large\\nboxes full of valuable merchandise. This energetic individual instantly\\nprepared for action. With our little party to back him, he speedily\\ncleared the poop of intruders and their stuff by the simple process of\\npushing or rather throwing them off it into the pit below. We then\\nsettled down as comfortably as we could; three Syrians, a married Turk\\nwith his wife and family, the Rais or captain of the vessel,\\n</p><p>[p.190] with a portion of his crew, and our seven selves, composing a\\ntotal of eighteen human beings, upon a space certainly not exceeding\\nten feet by eight. The cabin-a miserable box about the size of the\\npoop, and three feet high-was stuffed, like the hold of a slave ship,\\nwith fifteen wretches, children and women, and the other ninety-seven\\nwere disposed upon the luggage or squatted on the bulwarks. Having some\\nexperience in such matters, and being favoured by fortune, I found a\\nspare bed-frame slung to the ship\\'s side; and giving a dollar to its\\nowner, a sailor-who flattered himself that, because it was his, he\\nwould sleep upon it,-I instantly appropriated it, preferring any\\nhardship outside, to the condition of a packed herring inside, the\\nplace of torment.\\n</p><p>Our Maghrabis were fine-looking animals from the deserts about Tripoli\\nand Tunis; so savage that, but a few weeks ago, they had gazed at the\\ncock-boat, and wondered how long it would be growing to the size of the\\nship that was to take them to Alexandria. Most of them were sturdy\\nyoung fellows, round-headed, broad-shouldered, tall and large-limbed,\\nwith frowning eyes, and voices in a perpetual roar. Their manners were\\nrude, and their faces full of fierce contempt or insolent familiarity.\\nA few old men were there, with countenances expressive of intense\\nferocity; women as savage and full of fight as men; and handsome boys\\nwith shrill voices, and. hands always upon their daggers. The women\\nwere mere bundles of dirty white rags. The males were clad in\\n\"Burnus\"-brown or striped woollen cloaks with hoods; they had neither\\nturband nor tarbush, trusting to their thick curly hair or to the\\nprodigious hardness of their scalps as a defence against the sun; and\\nthere was not a slipper nor a shoe amongst the party.\\nOf course all were armed; but, fortunately for us, none had anything\\nmore formidable than a cut-and-thrust dagger about ten inches long.\\nThese Maghrabis travel in hordes under\\n</p><p>[p.191] a leader who obtains the temporary title of \"Maula,\"-the\\nmaster. He has generally performed a pilgrimage or two, and has\\ncollected a stock of superficial information which secures for him the\\nrespect of his followers, and the profound contempt of the heaven-made\\nCiceroni of Meccah and Al-Madinah. No people endure greater hardships\\nwhen upon the pilgrimage than these Africans, who trust almost entirely\\nto alms and to other such dispensations of Providence. It is not\\ntherefore to be wondered at that they rob whenever an opportunity\\npresents itself. Several cases of theft occurred on board the \"Golden\\nWire\"; and as such plunderers seldom allow themselves to be baulked by\\ninsufficient defence, they are accused, perhaps deservedly, of having\\ncommitted some revolting murders.\\n</p><p>The first thing to be done after gaining standing-room was to fight for\\ngreater comfort; and never a Holyhead packet in the olden time showed a\\nfiner scene of pugnacity than did our pilgrim ship. A few Turks, ragged\\nold men from Anatolia and Caramania, were mixed up with the Maghrabis,\\nand the former began the war by contemptuously elbowing and scolding\\ntheir wild neighbours. The Maghrabis, under their leader, \"Maula Ali,\"\\na burly savage, in whom I detected a ridiculous resemblance to the Rev.\\nCharles Delafosse, an old and well-remembered schoolmaster, retorted so\\nwillingly that in a few minutes nothing was to be seen but a confused\\nmass of humanity, each item indiscriminately punching and pulling,\\nscratching and biting, butting and trampling, with cries of rage, and\\nall the accompaniments of a proper fray, whatever was obnoxious to such\\noperations. One of our party on the poop, a Syrian, somewhat\\nincautiously leapt down to aid his countrymen by restoring order. He\\nsank immediately below the surface of the living mass: and when we\\nfished him out, his forehead was cut open, half his beard had\\ndisappeared, and a fine sharp set\\n</p><p>[p.192] of teeth belonging to some Maghrabi had left their mark in the\\ncalf of his leg. The enemy showed no love of fair play, and never\\nappeared contented unless five or six of them were setting upon a\\nsingle man. This made matters worse. The weaker of course drew their\\ndaggers, and a few bad wounds were soon given and received. In a few\\nminutes five men were completely disabled, and the victors began to\\ndread the consequences of their victory.\\n</p><p>Then the fighting stopped, and, as many could not find places, it was\\nagreed that a deputation should wait upon Ali Murad, the owner, to\\ninform him of the crowded state of the vessel. After keeping us in\\nexpectation at least three hours, he appeared in a row-boat, preserving\\na respectful distance, and informed us that any one who pleased might\\nquit the ship and take back his fare. This left the case exactly as it\\nwas before; none would abandon his party to go on shore: so Ali Murad\\nrowed off towards Suez, giving us a parting injunction to be good, and\\nnot fight&#160;; to trust in Allah, and that Allah would make all things\\neasy to us.\\tHis departure was the signal for a second fray, which\\nin its accidents differed a little from the first. During the previous\\ndisturbance we kept our places with weapons in our hands. This time we\\nwere summoned by the Maghrabis to relieve their difficulties, by taking\\nabout half a dozen of them on the poop. Sa\\'ad the Demon at once rose\\nwith an oath, and threw amongst us a bundle of \"Nabbut\"-goodly ashen\\nstaves six feet long, thick as a man\\'s wrist, well greased, and tried\\nin many a rough bout. He shouted to us \"Defend yourselves if you don\\'t\\nwish to be the meat of the Maghrabis!\" and to the enemy-\"Dogs and sons\\nof dogs! now shall you see what the children of the Arab are.\" \"I am\\nOmar of Daghistan!\" \"I am Abdullah the son of Joseph!\" \"I am Sa\\'ad the\\nDemon!\" we exclaimed, \"renowning it\" by this display of name and\\npatronymic. To do our enemies justice, they showed no\\n</p><p>[p.193] sign of flinching; they swarmed towards the poop like angry\\nhornets, and encouraged each other with cries of \"Allaho akbar!\" But we\\nhad a vantage-ground about four feet above them, and their palm-sticks\\nand short daggers could do nothing against our terrible quarterstaves.\\nIn vain the \"Jacquerie,\" tried to scale the poop and to overpower us by\\nnumbers; their courage only secured them more broken heads.\\n</p><p>At first I began to lay on load with main morte, really fearing to kill\\nsome one with such a weapon; but it soon became evident that the\\nMaghrabis\\' heads and shoulders could bear and did require the utmost\\nexertion of strength. Presently a thought struck me. A large earthen\\njar full of drinking water,[FN#3]-in its heavy frame of wood the weight\\nmight have been 100 lbs.,-stood upon the edge of the poop, and the\\nthick of the fray took place beneath. Seeing an opportunity, I crept up\\nto the jar, and, without attracting attention, rolled it down by a\\nsmart push with the shoulder upon the swarm of assailants. The fall\\ncaused a shriller shriek to rise above the ordinary din, for heads,\\nlimbs, and bodies were sorely bruised by the weight, scratched by the\\nbroken potsherds, and wetted by the sudden discharge. A fear that\\nsomething worse might be coming made the Maghrabis slink off towards\\nthe end of the vessel. After a few minutes, we, sitting in grave\\nsilence, received a deputation of individuals in whity-brown Burnus,\\nspotted and striped with what Mephistopheles calls a \"curious juice.\"\\nThey solicited peace, which we granted upon the condition that they\\nwould pledge themselves to keep it. Our heads, shoulders, and hands\\nwere penitentially kissed, and presently the fellows returned to bind\\nup their hurts in dirty\\n</p><p>[p.194] rags. We owed this victory entirely to our own exertions, and\\nthe meek Omar was by far the fiercest of the party. Our Rais, as we\\nafterwards learned, was an old fool who could do nothing but call for\\nthe Fatihah,[FN#4] claim Bakhshish at every place where we moored for\\nthe night, and spend his leisure hours in the \"Caccia del\\nMediterraneo.\" Our crew consisted of half a dozen Egyptian lads, who,\\nnot being able to defend themselves, were periodically chastised by the\\nMaghrabis, especially when any attempt was made to cook, to fetch\\nwater, or to prepare a pipe.[FN#5]\\n</p><p>At length, about 3 P.M. on the 6th July, 1853, we shook out the sail,\\nand, as it bellied in the favourable wind, we recited the Fatihah with\\nupraised hands which we afterwards drew down our faces.[FN#6] As the\\n\"Golden Wire\" started from her place, I could not help casting one\\nwistful look upon the British flag floating over the Consulate. But the\\nmomentary regret was stifled by the heart-bounding which prospects of\\nan adventure excite, and by the real pleasure of leaving Egypt. I had\\nlived there a stranger in the land, and a hapless life it had been: in\\nthe streets every man\\'s face, as he looked upon the Persian, was the\\nface of a foe. Whenever I came in contact with the native\\nofficials,[FN#7] insolence marked the\\n</p><p>[p.195] event; and the circumstance of living within hail of my\\nfellow-countrymen, and yet finding it impossible to enjoy their\\nsociety, still throws a gloom over the memory of my first sojourn in\\nEgypt.\\n</p><p>The ships of the Red Sea-infamous region of rocks, reefs, and\\nshoals-cruise along the coast by day, and at night lay-to in the first\\ncove they find; they do not sail when it blows hard, and as in winter\\ntime the weather is often stormy and the light of day does not last\\nlong, the voyage is intolerably slow.[FN#8] At sunset we stayed our\\nadventurous course; and, still within sight of Suez, comfortably\\nanchored under the lee of Jabal Atakah, the \"Mountain of\\nDeliverance,[FN#9]\" the butt-end of Jabal Joshi. We were now on classic\\nwaters. The Eastern shore was dotted with the little grove of\\npalm-trees which clusters around the Uyun Musa, or Moses\\' Wells; and on\\nthe west, between two towering ridges, lay the mouth of the valley\\n(Badiyah, or Wady Tawarik, or Wady Musa) down which, according to\\nFather Sicard,[FN#10] the Israelites fled to\\n</p><p>[p.196] the Sea of Sedge.[FN#11] The view was by no means deficient in\\na sort of barbarous splendour. Verdure there was none, but under the\\nviolet and orange tints of the sky the chalky rocks became heaps of\\ntopazes, and the brown-burnt ridges masses of amethyst. The rising\\nmists, here silvery white, there deeply rosy, and the bright blue of\\nthe waves,[FN#12] lining long strips of golden sand, compensated for\\nthe want of softness by a semblance of savage gorgeousness.\\n</p><p>Next morning (7th July), before the cerulean hue had vanished from the\\nhills, we set sail. It was not long before we came to a proper sense of\\nour position. The box containing my store of provisions, and, worse\\nstill, my opium, was at the bottom of the hold, perfectly\\nunapproachable; we had, therefore, the pleasure of breaking our fast on\\n\"Mare\\'s skin,\"[FN#13] and a species of biscuit, hard as a stone and\\nquite as tasteless. During the day, whilst insufferable splendour\\nreigned above, the dashing of the waters below kept my nest in a state\\nof perpetual drench. At night rose a cold, bright moon, with dews\\nfalling so thick and clammy that the skin felt as though it would never\\nbe dry again. It is, also, by no means pleasant\\n</p><p>[p.197] to sleep upon a broken cot about four feet long by two broad,\\nwith the certainty that a false movement would throw you overboard, and\\na conviction that if you do fall from a Sambuk under sail, no mortal\\npower can save you. And as under all circumstances in the East, dozing\\nis one\\'s chief occupation, the reader will understand that the want of\\nit left me in utter, utter idleness.\\n</p><p>The gale was light that day, and the sunbeams were fire; our crew\\npreferred crouching in the shade of the sail to taking advantage of\\nwhat wind there was. In spite of our impatience we made but little way:\\nnear evening time we anchored on a tongue of sand, about two miles\\ndistant from the well-known and picturesque heights called by the Arabs\\nHammam Faraun,[FN#14] which-\\n</p><p>\"like giants stand\\nTo sentinel enchanted land.\"\\n</p><p>The strip of coarse quartz and sandstone gravel is obviously the\\noffspring of some mountain torrent; it stretches southwards, being\\nprobably disposed in that direction by the currents of the sea as they\\nreceive the deposit. The distance of the \"Hammam Bluffs\" prevented my\\nvisiting them, which circumstance I regretted the less as they have\\nbeen described by pens equal to the task.\\n</p><p>That evening we enjoyed ourselves upon clean sand, whose surface,\\ndrifted by the wind into small yellow waves, was easily converted by a\\nlittle digging and heaping up, into the coolest and most comfortable of\\ncouches. Indeed, after the canescent heat of the day, and the tossing\\nof our ill-conditioned vessel, we should have been contented with\\nlodgings far less luxurious. Fuel was readily collected, and while some\\nbathed, others\\n</p><p><br />\\n[p.198] erected a hearth-three large stones and a hole open to\\nleeward-lit the fire and put the pot on to boil. Shaykh Nur had\\nfortunately a line; we had been successful in fishing; a little rice\\nalso had been bought; with this boiled, and rock-cod broiled upon the\\ncharcoal, we made a dinner that caused every one to forget the sore\\ngrievance of \"Mare\\'s skin\" and stone-hard biscuit. A few Maghrabis had\\nventured on shore, the Rais having terrified the others by threatening\\nthem with those \"bogies,\" the Badawin-and they offered us\\nKuskusu[FN#15] in exchange for fish. As evening fell, we determined,\\nbefore sleeping, to work upon their \"morale\" as effectually as we had\\nattacked their physique. Shaykh Hamid stood up and indulged them with\\nthe Azan, or call to prayers, pronounced after the fashion of\\nAl-Madinah.[FN#16] They performed their devotions in lines ranged\\nbehind us as a token of respect, and when worship was over we were\\nquestioned about the Holy City till we grew tired of answering. Again\\nour heads and shoulders, our hands and knees,[FN#17] were kissed, but\\nthis time in devotion, not in penitence. My companions could scarcely\\nunderstand half the rugged words which the Maghrabis used,[FN#18] as\\ntheir dialect was fresh from the\\n</p><p>[p.199] distant Desert. Still we succeeded in making ourselves\\nintelligible to them, vaunting our dignity as the Sons of the Prophet,\\nand the sanctity of our land which should protect its children from\\nevery description of fraud and violence. We benignantly promised to be\\ntheir guides at Al-Madinah, and the boy Mohammed would conduct their\\ndevotions at Meccah, always provided that they repented their past\\nmisdeeds, avoided any repetition of the same, and promised to perform\\nthe duties of good and faithful pilgrims. Presently the Rais joined our\\nparty, and the usual story-telling began. The old man knew the name of\\neach hill, and had a legend for every nook and corner in sight. He\\ndwelt at length upon the life of Abu Zulaymah, the patron saint of\\nthese seas, whose little tomb stands at no great distance from our\\nbivouac place, and told us how he sits watching over the safety of\\npious mariners in a cave among the neighbouring rocks, and sipping his\\ncoffee, which is brought in a raw state from Meccah by green birds, and\\nprepared in the usual way by the hands of ministering angels. He showed\\nus the spot where the terrible king of Egypt, when close upon the heels\\nof the children of Israel, was whelmed in the \"hell of waters,[FN#19]\"\\nand he warned us that next day our way would be through breakers, and\\nreefs, and dangerous currents, over whose troubled depths, since that\\nawful day, the Ifrit of the storm has never ceased to flap his sable\\nwing. The wincing of the hearers proved that the shaft of the old man\\'s\\nwords was sharp; but as night was advancing, we unrolled our rugs, and\\nfell asleep upon the sand, all of us happy, for we had fed and drunk,\\nand\\n</p><p>[p.200]-the homo sapiens is a hopeful animal-we made sure that on the\\nmorrow the Ifrit would be merciful, and allow us to eat fresh dates at\\nthe harbour of Tur.\\n</p><p>Fair visions of dates doomed to the Limbo of things which should have\\nbeen! The grey dawn (8th July) looked down upon us in difficulties. The\\nwater is deep near this coast; we had anchored at high tide close to\\nthe shore, and the ebb had left us high and dry. When this fact became\\napparent, a storm was upon the point of breaking. The Maghrabis, but\\nfor our interference, would have bastinadoed the Rais, who, they said\\nwith some reason, ought to have known better. When this phase of\\nfeeling passed away, they applied themselves to physical efforts. All\\nexcept the women and children, who stood on the shore encouraging their\\nrelatives with shrill quaverings, threw themselves into the water; some\\npushed, others applied their shoulders to the vessel\\'s side, and all\\nused their lungs with might and main. But the \"Golden Wire\" was firmly\\nfixed, and their exertions were too irregular. Muscular force failed,\\nupon which they changed their tactics. At the suggestion of their\\n\"Maula,\" they prepared to burn incense in honour of the Shaykh Abu\\nZulaymah. The material not being forthcoming, they used coffee, which\\nperhaps accounts for the shortcomings of that holy man. After this the\\nRais remembered that their previous exertions had not begun under the\\nauspices of the Fatihah. Therefore they prayed, and then reapplied\\nthemselves to work. Still they failed. Finally, each man called aloud\\nupon his own particular saint or spiritual guide, and rushed forward as\\nif he alone sufficed for the exploit. Shaykh Hamid unwisely quoted the\\nname, and begged the assistance, of his great ancestor, the\\n\"Clarified-Butter-Seller\"; the obdurate \"Golden Wire\" was not moved,\\nand Hamid retired in momentary confusion.\\n</p><p>It was now about nine A.M., and the water had risen\\n</p><p>[p.201] considerably. My morning had been passed in watching the influx\\nof the tide, and the grotesque efforts of the Maghrabis. When the\\nvessel showed some symptoms of unsteadiness, I arose, walked gravely up\\nto her, ranged the pilgrims around her with their shoulders to the\\nsides, and told them to heave with might when they heard me invoke the\\nrevered name of my patron saint. I raised my hands and voice; \"Ya Piran\\nPir! Ya Abd al-Kadir Jilani[FM#20]\" was the signal. Each Maghrabi\\nworked like an Atlas, the \"Golden Wire\" canted half over, and, sliding\\nheavily through the sand, once more floated off into deep water. This\\nwas generally voted a minor miracle, and the Effendi was respected-for\\na day or two.\\n</p><p>The wind was fair, but we had all to re-embark, an operation which went\\non till noon. After starting I remarked the natural cause which gives\\nthis Birkat Faraun-\"Pharaoh\\'s Bay,\"-a bad name. Here the gulf narrows;\\nand the winds, which rush down the clefts and valleys of the lofty\\nmountains on the Eastern and Western shores, meeting tides and\\ncounter-currents, cause a perpetual commotion. That day the foam-tipped\\nwaves repeatedly washed over my cot, by no means diminishing its\\ndiscomforts. In the evening, or rather late in the afternoon, we\\nanchored, to our infinite disgust, under a ridge of rocks, behind which\\nlies the plain of Tur. The Rais deterred all from going on shore by\\nterrible stories about the Badawin that haunt the place, besides which\\nthere was no sand to sleep upon. We remained, therefore, on board that\\nnight; and, making sail early the next morning, we threaded through\\nreefs and sand-banks about noon into the intricate and dangerous\\nentrance of Tur.\\n</p><p>Nothing can be meaner than the present appearance of the old Phoenician\\ncolony, although its position as a\\n</p><p>[p.202] harbour, and its plentiful supply of fruit and fresh water,\\nmake it one of the most frequented places on the coast. The only\\nremains of any antiquity-except the wells-are the fortifications which\\nthe Portuguese erected to keep out the Badawin. The little town lies\\nupon a plain that stretches with a gradual rise from the sea to the\\nlofty mountain-axis of the Sinaitic group.\\tThe country around\\nreminded me strongly of maritime Sind; a flat of clay and sand, clothed\\nwith sparse turfs of Salsolae, and bearing strong signs of a\\n(geologically speaking) recent origin. The town is inhabited\\nprincipally by Greek and other Christians,[FN#21] who live by selling\\nwater and provisions to ships. A fleecy cloud hung lightly over the\\nmajestic head of Jabal Tur, about eventide, and the outlines of the\\ngiant hills stood \"picked out\" from the clear blue sky. Our Rais,\\nweather-wise man, warned us that these were indications of a gale, and\\nthat, in case of rough weather, he did not intend to leave Tur. I was\\nnot sorry to hear this. We had passed a pleasant day, drinking sweet\\nwater, and eating the dates, grapes, and pomegranates, which the people\\nof the place carry down to the beach for the benefit of hungry\\npilgrims. Besides which, there were various sights to see, and with\\nthese we might profitably spend the morrow. We therefore pitched the\\ntent upon the sand, and busied ourselves with\\n</p><p>[p.203] extricating a box of provisions: the labour was rendered\\nlighter by the absence of the Maghrabis, some of whom were wandering\\nabout the beach, whilst others had gone off to fill their bags with\\nfresh water. We found their surliness insufferable; even when we were\\npassing from poop to forecastle, landing or boarding, they grumbled\\nforth their dissatisfaction.\\n</p><p>Our Rais was not mistaken in his prediction. The fleecy cloud on Tur\\'s\\ntops had given true warning. When morning (9th July) broke, we found\\nthe wind strong, and the sea white with foam. Most of us thought\\nlightly of these terrors, but our valorous captain swore that he dared\\nnot for his life cross in such a storm the mouth of ill-omened Akabah.\\nWe breakfasted, therefore, and afterwards set out to visit Moses\\' Hot\\nBaths, mounted on wretched donkeys with pack-saddles, ignorant of\\nstirrups, and without tails, whilst we ourselves suffered generally\\nfrom boils, which, as usual upon a journey, make their appearance in\\nlocalities the most inconvenient. Our road lay northward across the\\nplain towards a long narrow strip of date ground, surrounded by a\\nruinous mud wall. After a ride of two or three miles, we entered the\\ngardens, and came suddenly upon the Hammam. It is a prim little Cockney\\nbungalow, built by Abbas Pasha of Egypt for his own accommodation;\\nglaringly whitewashed, and garnished with diwans and calico curtains of\\na gorgeous hue. The guardian had been warned of our visit, and was\\npresent to supply us with bathing-cloths and other necessaries. One by\\none we entered the cistern, which is now in an inner room. The water is\\nabout four feet deep, warm in winter, cool in summer, of a\\nsaltish-bitter taste, but celebrated for its invigorating qualities,\\nwhen applied externally. On one side of the calcareous rock, near the\\nground, is the hole opened for the spring by Moses\\' rod, which must\\nhave been like the \"mast of some tall\\n</p><p>[p.204] Ammiral[FN#22]\"; and near it are the marks of Moses\\' nails-deep\\nindentations in the stone, which were probably left there by some\\nextinct Saurian. Our Cicerone informed us that formerly the\\nfinger-marks existed, and that they were long enough for a man to lie\\nin. The same functionary attributed the sanitary properties of the\\nspring to the blessings of the Prophet, and, when asked why Moses had\\nnot made sweet water to flow, informed us that the Great Lawgiver had\\nintended the spring for bathing in, not for drinking. We sat with him,\\neating the small yellow dates of Tur, which are delicious, melting like\\nhoney in the mouth, and leaving a surpassing arriere gout. After\\nfinishing sundry pipes and cups of coffee, we gave the bath-man a few\\npiastres, and, mounting our donkeys, started eastward for the Bir\\nMusa,[FN#23] which we reached in half an hour. It is a fine old work,\\nbuilt round and domed over with roughly squared stones, very like what\\nmay be seen in some rustic parts of Southern England. The sides of the\\npit were so rugged that a man could climb down them, and at the bottom\\nwas a pool of water, sweet and abundant. We had intended to stay there,\\nand to dine al fresco, but the hated faces of our companions, the\\nMaghrabis, meeting us at the entrance, nipped that project in the bud.\\nAccordingly we retired from the burning\\n</p><p>[p.205] sun to a neighbouring coffee-house-a shed of palm leaves kept\\nby a Tur man, and there, seated on mats, we demolished the contents of\\nour basket. Whilst we were eating, some Badawin came in and joined us,\\nwhen invited so to do. They were poorly dressed, and all armed with\\nknives and cheap sabres, hanging to leathern bandoleers: in language\\nand demeanour they showed few remains of their old ferocity. As late as\\nMohammed Ali\\'s time these people were noted wreckers, and formerly they\\nwere dreaded pirates: now they are lions with their fangs and claws\\ndrawn.\\n</p><p>In the even, when we returned to our tent, a Syrian, one of our party\\non the poop, came out to meet us with the information that several\\nlarge vessels had arrived from Suez, comparatively speaking, empty, and\\nthat the captain of one of them would land us at Yambu\\' for three\\ndollars a head. The proposal was tempting. But presently it became\\napparent that my companions were unwilling to shift their precious\\nboxes, and moreover, that I should have to pay for those who could not\\nor would not pay for themselves,-that is to say, for the whole party.\\nAs such a display of wealth would have been unadvisable, I dismissed\\nthe idea with a sigh. Amongst the large vessels was one freighted with\\nPersian pilgrims, a most disagreeable race of men on a journey or a\\nvoyage. They would not land at first, because they feared the Badawin.\\nThey would not take water from the town people, because some of these\\nwere Christians. Moreover, they insisted upon making their own call to\\nprayer, which heretical proceeding-it admits five extra words-our\\nparty, orthodox Moslems, would rather have died than have permitted.\\nWhen their crier, a small wizen-faced man, began the Azan with a voice\\n</p><p>\"in quel tenore\\nChe fa il cappon quando talvolta canta,\"\\n</p><p>we received it with a shout of derision, and some, hastily\\n</p><p>[p.206] snatching up their weapons, offered him an opportunity of\\nmartyrdom. The Maghrabis, too, hearing that the Persians were Rafaz\\n(heretics) crowded fiercely round to do a little Jihad, or Fighting for\\nthe Faith. The long-bearded men took the alarm. They were twice the\\nnumber of our small party, and therefore they had been in the habit of\\nstrutting about with nonchalance, and looking at us fixedly, and\\notherwise demeaning themselves in an indecorous way. But when it came\\nto the point, they showed the white feather. These Persians accompanied\\nus to the end of our voyage. As they approached the Holy Land, visions\\nof the \"Nabbut\" caused a change for the better in their manners. At\\nMahar they meekly endured a variety of insults, and at Yambu\\' they\\ncringed to us like dogs.\\n</p><p>[FN#1] Men of the Maghrab, or Western Africa; the vulgar plural is\\nMaghrabin, generally written \"Mogrebyn.\" May not the singular form of\\nthis word have given rise to the Latin \"Maurus,\" by elision of the\\nGhayn, to Italians an unpronounceable consonant? From Maurus comes the\\nPortuguese \"Moro,\" and our \"Moor.\" When Vasco de Gama reached Calicut,\\nhe found there a tribe of Arab colonists, who in religion and in\\nlanguage were the same as the people of Northern Africa,-for this\\nreason he called them \"Moors.\" This was explained long ago by Vincent\\n(Periplus, lib. 3), and lately by Prichard (Natural History of Man). I\\nrepeat it because it has been my fate to hear, at a meeting of a\\nlearned society in London, a gentleman declare, that in Eastern Africa\\nhe found a people calling themselves Moors. Maghrabin-Westerns,-then\\nwould be opposed to Sharkiyin, Easterns, the origin of our \"Saracen.\"\\nFrom Gibbon downwards many have discussed the history of this word; but\\nfew expected in the nineteenth century to see a writer on Eastern\\nsubjects assert, with Sir John Mandeville, that these people \"properly,\\nben clept Sarrazins of Sarra.\" The learned M. Jomard, who never takes\\nsuch original views of things, asks a curious question:-\"Mais comment\\nun son aussi distinct que le Chine \\xd8\\xb4[Arabic text] aurait-il pu se\\nconfondre avec le Syn \\xd8\\xb3[Arabic text] et, pour un mot aussi connu que\\ncharq; comment aurait-on pu se tromper a l\\'omission des points?\" Simply\\nbecause the word Saracens came to us through the Greeks (Ptolemy uses\\nit), who have no such sound as sh in their language, and through the\\nItalian which, hostile to the harsh sibilants of Oriental dialects,\\ngenerally melts sh down into s. So the historical word\\nHashshashiyun-hemp-drinker,-civilised by the Italians into \"assassino,\"\\nbecame, as all know, an expression of European use. But if any one\\nadverse to \"etymological fancies\" objects to my deriving Maurus from\\n\"Maghrab,\" let him remember Johnson\\'s successfully tracing the course\\nof the metamorphosis of \"dies\" into \"jour.\" An even more peculiar\\nchange we may discover in the word \"elephant.\" \"Pilu\" in Sanscrit,\\nbecame \"pil\" in old Persian, which ignores short final vowels; \"fil,\"\\nand, with the article, \"Al-fil,\" in Arabic, which supplies the place of\\np (an unknown letter to it), by f; and elephas in Greek, which is fond\\nof adding \"as\" to Arabic words, as in the cases of Aretas (Haris) and\\nObodas (Obayd). \"A name,\" says Humboldt, \"often becoming a historical\\nmonument, and the etymological analysis of language, however it may be\\ndivided, is attended by valuable results.\"\\n[FN#2] The Toni or Indian canoe is the hollowed-out trunk of a\\ntree,-near Bombay generally a mango.

At the same time\\nit must be owned that I have seen the worst of it.\\n[FN#8] It was far safer and more expeditious in Al-Adrisi\\'s day (A.D.\\n1154), when the captain used to sit on the poop \"furnished with\\nnumerous and useful instruments\"; when he \"sounded the shallows, and by\\nhis knowledge of the depths could direct the helmsman where to steer.\"\\n[FN#9] In the East it is usual, when commencing a voyage or a journey,\\nto make a short day\\'s work, in order to be at a convenient distance for\\nreturning, in case of any essential article having been forgotten.\\n[FN#10] A Jesuit missionary who visited the place in A.D. 1720, and\\ndescribed it in a well-known volume.

Originally they were 100\\nhouseholds, sent by Justinian to serve the convent of St. Catherine,\\nand to defend it against the Berbers.\\tSultan Kansuh al-Ghori, called\\nby European writers Campson Gaury, the Mamluk King of Egypt, in A.D.\\n1501, admitted these people into the Moslem community on condition of\\ntheir continuing the menial service they had afforded to the monks.\\n[FN#22] Adam\\'s forehead (says the Tarikh Tabari) brushed the skies, but\\nthis height being inconvenient, the Lord abridged it to 100 cubits. The\\nMoslems firmly believe in Anakim. Josephus informs us that Moses was of\\n\"divine form and great tallness\"; the Arabs specify his stature,-300\\ncubits. They have, moreover, found his grave in some parts of the\\ncountry S.E, of the Dead Sea, and make cups of a kind of bitumen called\\n\"Moses\\' Stones.\" This people nescit ignorare-it will know everything.\\n[FN#23] \"Moses\\' Well.\" I have no argument except the untrustworthy\\ntraditions of the Badawin, either for or against this having been the\\nidentical well near which Moses sat when he fled from the face of\\nPharaoh to the land of Midian. One thing is certain, namely, that in\\nthis part of Arabia, as also at Aden, the wells are of a very ancient\\ndate.\\n</p>\\n<h2><span id=\"Chapter_XI._TO_YAMBU.27.\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Chapter_XI._TO_YAMBU\\'.\">Chapter XI.

I passed the time in steadfast contemplation of the web of my\\numbrella, and in making the following meteorological remarks.\\n</p><p>Morning.-The air is mild and balmy as that of an Italian spring; thick\\nmists roll down the valleys along the sea, and a haze like\\nmother-o\\'-pearl crowns the headlands. The distant rocks show Titanic\\nwalls, lofty donjons, huge projecting bastions, and moats full of deep\\nshade. At their base runs a sea of amethyst, and as earth receives the\\nfirst touches of light, their summits, almost transparent, mingle with\\nthe jasper tints of the sky. Nothing can be more delicious than this\\nhour. But as\\n</p><p>\"les plus belles choses\\nOnt le pire destin,\"\\n</p><p>so lovely Morning soon fades. The sun bursts up from behind the main, a\\nfierce enemy, a foe that will force every one to crouch before him. He\\ndyes the sky orange, and the sea \"incarnadine,\" where its violet\\nsurface is stained by his rays, and he mercilessly puts to flight the\\nmists and haze and the little agate-coloured masses of cloud that were\\nbefore floating in the firmament. The atmosphere is so clear that now\\nand then a planet is visible. For the two\\n</p><p>[p.208] hours following sunrise the rays are endurable; after that they\\nbecome a fiery ordeal. The morning beams oppress you with a feeling of\\nsickness; their steady glow, reflected by the glaring waters, blinds\\nyour eyes, blisters your skin, and parches your mouth: you now become a\\nmonomaniac; you do nothing but count the slow hours that must \"minute\\nby\" before you can be relieved.[FN#1]\\n</p><p>Midday.-The wind, reverberated by the glowing hills is like the blast\\nof a lime-kiln. All colour melts away with the canescence from above.\\nThe sky is a dead milk-white, and the mirror-like sea so reflects the\\ntint that you can scarcely distinguish the line of the horizon. After\\nnoon the wind sleeps upon the reeking shore; there is a deep stillness;\\nthe only sound heard is the melancholy flapping of the sail. Men are\\nnot so much sleeping as half-senseless; they feel as if a few more\\ndegrees of heat would be death.\\n</p><p>Sunset.-The enemy sinks behind the deep cerulean sea, under a canopy of\\ngigantic rainbow which covers half the face of heaven. Nearest to the\\nhorizon is an arch of tawny orange; above it another of the brightest\\ngold, and based upon these a semi-circle of tender sea-green blends\\nwith a score of delicate gradations into the sapphire sky. Across the\\nrainbow the sun throws its rays in the form of giant wheel-spokes\\ntinged with a beautiful pink. The Eastern sky is mantled with a purple\\nflush that picks out the forms of the hazy Desert and the sharp-cut\\nHills. Language is a thing too cold, too poor, to express the harmony\\nand the majesty of this hour, which is as evanescent, however, as it is\\nlovely. Night falls rapidly, when suddenly the appearance of the\\nZodiacal Light[FN#2] restores\\n</p><p>[p.209] the scene to what it was. Again the grey hills and the grim\\nrocks become rosy or golden, the palms green, the sands saffron, and\\nthe sea wears a lilac surface of dimpling waves. But after a quarter of\\nan hour all fades once more; the cliffs are naked and ghastly under the\\nmoon, whose light falling upon this wilderness of white crags and\\npinnacles is most strange-most mysterious.\\n</p><p>Night.-The horizon is all darkness, and the sea reflects the white\\nvisage of the night-sun as in a mirror of steel. In the air we see\\ngiant columns of pallid light, distinct, based upon the indigo-coloured\\nwaves, and standing with their heads lost in endless space. The stars\\nglitter with exceeding brilliance.[FN#3] At this hour are\\n</p><p>\"-river and hill and wood,\\nWith all the numberless goings on of life,\\nInaudible as dreams\";\\n</p><p>while the planets look down upon you with the faces of smiling friends.\\nYou feel the \"sweet influence of the Pleiades.\" You are bound by the\\n\"bond of Orion.\" Hesperus bears with him a thousand things. In\\ncommunion with them your hours pass swiftly by, till the heavy dews\\nwarn you to cover up your face and sleep. And with one look at a\\ncertain little Star in the north, under which lies all that makes life\\nworth living through-surely it is a venial superstition to sleep with\\nyour eyes towards that Kiblah!-you fall into oblivion.\\n</p><p>Those thirty-six hours were a trial even to the hard-headed Badawin.\\nThe Syrian and his two friends fell ill. Omar Effendi, it is true, had\\nthe courage to say his\\n</p><p>[p.210] sunset prayers, but the exertion so altered him that he looked\\nanother man. Salih Shakkar in despair ate dates till threatened with a\\ndysentery. Sa\\'ad the Demon had rigged out for himself a cot three feet\\nlong, which, arched over with bent bamboo, and covered with cloaks, he\\nhad slung on to the larboard side; but the loud grumbling which\\nproceeded from his nest proved that his precaution had not been a cure.\\nEven the boy Mohammed forgot to chatter, to scold, to smoke, and to\\nmake himself generally disagreeable. The Turkish baby appeared to be\\ndying, and was not strong enough to wail. How the poor mother stood her\\ntrials so well, made every one wonder. The most pleasant trait in my\\ncompanions\\' characters was the consideration they showed to her, and\\ntheir attention to her children. Whenever one of the party drew forth a\\nlittle delicacy-a few dates or a pomegranate-they gave away a share of\\nit to the children, and most of them took their turns to nurse the\\nbaby. This was genuine politeness-kindness of heart. It would be well\\nfor those who sweepingly accuse Easterns of want of gallantry, to\\ncontrast this trait of character with the savage scenes of civilisation\\nthat take place among the \"Overlands\" at Cairo and Suez.[FN#4] No\\nforeigner could be present for the first time without bearing away the\\nlasting impression that the sons of Great Britain are model\\nbarbarians.[FN#5] On board the \"Golden Wire\" Salih Shakkar was the sole\\nbase exception to the general geniality of my companions.\\n</p><p>As the sun starts towards the West, falling harmlessly upon our heads,\\nwe arise, still faint and dizzy, calling for water-which before we had\\nnot the strength\\n</p><p>[p.211] to drink-and pipes, and coffee, and similar luxuries. Our\\nprimitive kitchen is a square wooden box, lined with clay, and filled\\nwith sand, upon which three or four large stones are placed to form a\\nhearth. Preparations are now made for the evening meal, which is of the\\nsimplest description. A little rice, a few dates, or an onion, will\\nkeep a man alive in our position; a single \"good dinner\" would justify\\nlong odds against his seeing the next evening. Moreover, it is\\nimpossible in such cases to have an appetite-fortunately, as our store\\nof provisions is a scanty one. Arabs consider it desirable on a journey\\nto eat hot food once in the twenty-four hours; so we determine to cook,\\ndespite all difficulties. The operation, however, is by no means\\nsatisfactory; twenty expectants surround the single fire, and there is\\nsure to be a quarrel amongst them every five minutes.\\n</p><p>As the breeze, cooled by the dew, begins to fan our parched faces, we\\nrecover our spirits amazingly. Songs are sung; tales are told; and\\nrough jests are bandied about till, not unfrequently, Oriental\\nsensitiveness is sorely tried. Or, if we see the prospect of storm or\\ncalm, we draw forth, and piously peruse, a \"Hizb al-Bahr.\" As this\\nprayer is supposed to make all safe upon the ocean wave, I will not\\nselfishly withhold it from the British reader. To draw forth all its\\nvirtues, the reciter should receive it from the hands of his Murshid or\\nspiritual guide, and study it during the Chillah, or forty days of\\nfast, of which, I venture to observe, few Sons of Bull are capable.\\n</p><p>\"O Allah, O Exalted, O Almighty, O All-pitiful, O All-powerful, Thou\\nart my God, and sufficeth to me the knowledge of it! Glorified be the\\nLord my Lord, and glorified be the Faith my Faith! Thou givest Victory\\nto whom Thou pleasest, and Thou art the Glorious, the Merciful! We pray\\nThee for Safety in our goings forth and our standings still, in our\\nWords and our Designs, in our\\n</p><p>[p.212] Dangers of Temptation and Doubt, and the secret Designs of our\\nHearts. Subject unto us this Sea, even as Thou didst subject the Deep\\nto Musa\" (Moses), \"and as Thou didst subject the Fire to Ibrahim[FN#6]\"\\n(Abraham), \"and as Thou didst subject the Iron to Daud[FN#7]\" (David),\\n\"and as Thou didst subject the Wind and the Devils and Jinnis and\\nMankind to Sulayman[FN#8]\" (Solomon), \"and as Thou didst subject the\\nMoon and Al-Burak to Mohammed, upon whom be Allah\\'s Mercy and His\\nBlessing! And subject unto us all the Seas in Earth and Heaven, in Thy\\nvisible and in Thine invisible Worlds, the Sea of this Life, and the\\nSea of Futurity. O Thou who reignest over everything, and unto whom all\\nThings return, Khyas! Khyas! Khyas[FN#9]!\"\\n</p><p>And lastly, we lie down upon our cribs, wrapped up in thickly padded\\ncotton coverlets; we forget the troubles of the past day, and we care\\nnought for the discomforts of that to come.\\n</p><p>Late on the evening of the 11th July we passed in sight of the narrow\\nmouth of Al-\\'Akabah, whose famosi rupes are a terror to the voyagers of\\nthese latitudes. Like the Gulf of Cambay, here a tempest is said to be\\nalways brewing, and men raise their hands to pray as they cross it. We\\nhad no storm that day from without, but a fierce one was about to burst\\nwithin our ship. The essence of Oriental discipline is personal respect\\nbased upon fear. Therefore it often happens that the commanding\\nofficer,\\n</p><p>[p.213] if a mild old gentleman, is the last person whose command is\\nobeyed,-his only privilege being that of sitting apart from his\\ninferiors. And such was the case with our Rais. On the present\\noccasion, irritated by the refusal of the Maghrabis to stand out of the\\nsteerman\\'s way, and excited by the prospect of losing sight of shore\\nfor a whole day, he threatened one of the fellows with his slipper. It\\nrequired all our exertions, even to a display of the dreaded\\nquarter-staves, to calm the consequent excitement. After passing\\nAl-\\'Akabah, we saw nothing but sea and sky, and we spent a weary night\\nand day tossing upon the waters, our only exercise; every face\\nbrightened as, about sunset on the 12th July, we suddenly glided into\\nthe mooring-place.\\n</p><p>Marsa (anchorage) Damghah,[FN#10] or rather Dumayghah, is scarcely\\nvisible from the sea. An islet of limestone rock defends the entrance,\\nleaving a narrow passage to the south. It is not before he enters that\\nthe mariner discovers the extent and the depth of this creek, which\\nindents far into the land, and offers 15 to 20 feet of fine clear\\nanchorage which no swell can reach. Inside it looks more like a lake,\\nand at night its colour is gloriously blue as Geneva itself. I could\\nnot help calling to mind, after dinner, the old school lines\\n</p><p>\"Est in secessu longo locus; insula portum\\nEfficit objectu laterum; quibus omnis ab alto\\nFrangitur, inque sinus scindit sese unda reductos.\"\\n</p><p>Nothing was wanted but the \"atrum nemus.\" Where however, shall we find\\nsuch luxuries in arid Arabia?\\n</p><p>The Rais, as usual, attempted to deter us from landing, by romancing\\nabout the \"Bedoynes and Ascopards,\" representing them to be \"folke\\nryghte felonouse and foule and of cursed kynde.\" To which we replied by\\nshouldering our Nabbuts and scrambling into the cock-boat\\n</p><p>[p.214] On shore we saw a few wretched-looking beings, Juhaynah[FN#11]\\nor Hutaym, seated upon heaps of dried wood, which they sold to\\ntravellers; and three boat-loads of Syrian pilgrims who had preceded\\nus. We often envied them their small swift craft, with their double\\nlatine sails disposed in \"hare-ears\" which, about eventide in the far\\ndistance, looked like a white gull alighting upon the purple wave; and\\nthey justified our jealousy by arriving at Yambu\\' two days before us.\\nThe pilgrims had bivouacked upon the beach, and were engaged in\\ndrinking their after-dinner coffee. They received us with all the\\nrights of hospitality, as natives of Al-Madinah should everywhere be\\nreceived; we sat an hour with them, ate a little fruit, satisfied our\\nthirst, smoked their pipes, and when taking leave blessed them. Then\\nreturning to the vessel we fed, and lost no time in falling asleep.\\n</p><p>The dawn of the next day saw our sail flapping in the idle air. And it\\nwas not without difficulty that in the course of the forenoon we\\nentered Wijh Harbour, distant from Dumayghah but very few miles.\\nAl-Wijh is also a natural anchorage, in no way differing from that\\nwhere we passed the night, except in being smaller and shallower and\\nless secure. From this place to Cairo the road is safe. The town is a\\ncollection of round huts meanly built of round stones, and clustering\\nupon a piece of elevated rock on the northern side of the creek. It is\\n</p><p>[p.215] distant about six miles from the inland fort of the same name,\\nwhich receives the Egyptian caravan, and which thrives, like its port,\\nby selling water and provisions to pilgrims. The little bazar, almost\\nwashed by every high tide, provided us with mutton, rice, baked bread,\\nand the other necessaries of life at a moderate rate. Luxuries also\\nwere to be found: a druggist sold me an ounce of opium at a Chinese\\nprice.\\n</p><p>With reeling limbs we landed at Al-Wijh,[FN#12] and finding a large\\ncoffee-house above and near the beach, we installed ourselves there.\\nBut the Persians who preceded us had occupied all the shady places\\noutside, and were correcting their teeth with their case knives; we\\nwere forced to content ourselves with the interior. It was a building\\nof artless construction, consisting of little but a roof supported by\\nwooden posts, roughly hewn from date trees: round the tamped earthen\\nfloor ran a raised bench of unbaked brick, forming a diwan for mats and\\nsleeping-rugs. In the centre a huge square Mastabah, or platform,\\nanswered a similar purpose. Here and there appeared attempts at long\\nand side walls, but these superfluities had been allowed to admit\\ndaylight through large gaps. In one corner stood the apparatus of the\\n\"Kahwahji,\" an altar-like elevation, also of earthen-work, containing a\\nhole for a charcoal fire, upon which were three huge coffee-pots\\ndirtily tinned. Near it were ranged the Shishas, or Egyptian hookahs,\\nold, exceedingly unclean, and worn by age and hard work. A wooden\\nframework, pierced with circular apertures, supported a number of\\nporous earthenware gullehs (gargoulettes, or monkey jars) full of cold,\\nsweet water; the charge for each was, as usual in Al-Hijaz, five paras.\\nSuch was the furniture of the cafe, and the only relief to the\\nbarrenness of the view was a fine mellowing atmosphere composed of\\nsmoke, steam,\\n</p><p>[p.216] flies, and gnats in about equal proportions. I have been\\ndiffuse in my description of the coffee-house, as it was a type of its\\nclass: from Alexandria to Aden the traveller will everywhere meet with\\nbuildings of the same kind.\\n</p><p>Our happiness in this Paradise-for such it was to us after the \"Golden\\nWire\"-was nearly sacrificed by Sa\\'ad the Demon, whose abominable temper\\nled him at once into a quarrel with the master of the cafe. And the\\nlatter, an ill-looking, squint-eyed, low-browed, broad-shouldered\\nfellow, showed himself nowise unwilling to meet the Demon half way. The\\ntwo worthies, after a brief bandying of bad words, seized each other\\'s\\nthroats leisurely, so as to give the spectators time and encouragement\\nto interfere. But when friends and acquaintances were hanging on to\\nboth heroes so firmly that they could not move hand or arm, their\\nwrath, as usual, rose, till it was terrible to see. The little village\\nresounded with the war, and many a sturdy knave rushed in, sword or\\ncudgel in hand, so as not to lose the sport. During the heat of the\\nfray, a pistol which was in Omar Effendi\\'s hand went off-accidentally\\nof course-and the ball passed so close to the tins containing the black\\nand muddy Mocha, that it drew the attention of all parties. As if by\\nmagic, the storm was lulled. A friend recognised Sa\\'ad the Demon, and\\nswore that he was no black slave, but a soldier at Al-Madinah-\"no\\nwaiter, but a Knight Templar.\" This caused him to be looked upon as\\nrather a distinguished man, and he proved his right to the honour by\\ninsisting that his late enemy should feed with him, and when the other\\ndecorously hung back, by dragging him to dinner with loud cries.\\n</p><p>My alias that day was severely tried. Besides the Persian pilgrims, a\\nnumber of nondescripts who came in the same vessel were hanging about\\nthe coffee-house; lying down, smoking, drinking water, bathing and\\npicking their teeth with their daggers. One inquisitive man\\n</p><p>[p.217] was always at my side. He called himself a Pathan (Afghan\\nsettled in India); he could speak five or six languages, he knew a\\nnumber of people everywhere, and he had travelled far and wide over\\nCentral Asia. These fellows are always good detectors of an incognito.\\nI avoided answering his question about my native place, and after\\ntelling him that I had no longer name or nation, being a Darwaysh, I\\nasked him, when he insisted upon my having been born somewhere, to\\nguess for himself. To my joy he claimed me for a brother Pathan, and in\\ncourse of conversation he declared himself to be the nephew of an\\nAfghan merchant, a gallant old man who had been civil to me at Cairo.\\nWe then sat smoking together with \"effusion.\" Becoming confidential, he\\ncomplained that he, a Sunni, or orthodox Moslem, had been abused,\\nmaltreated, and beaten by his fellow-travellers, the heretical Persian\\npilgrims. I naturally offered to arm my party, to take up our cudgels,\\nand to revenge my compatriot. This thoroughly Sulaymanian style of\\ndoing business could not fail to make him sure of his man. He declined,\\nhowever, wisely remembering that he had nearly a fortnight of the\\nPersians\\' society still to endure. But he promised himself the\\ngratification, when he reached Meccah, of sheathing his Charay[FN#13]\\nin the chief offender\\'s heart.\\n</p><p>At 8 A.M.} on the 14th July we left Al-Wijh, after passing a night,\\ntolerably comfortable by contrast, in the coffee-house. We took with us\\nthe stores necessary, for though our Rais had promised to anchor under\\nJabal Hassani that evening, no one believed him. We sailed among ledges\\nof rock, golden sands, green weeds, and in some places through yellow\\nlines of what appeared to me at a distance foam after a storm. All day\\na sailor sat upon the masthead, looking at the water, which was\\ntransparent as blue glass, and shouting out the direction. This\\nprecaution was somewhat stultified by the roar of voices, which never\\n</p><p>[p.218] failed to mingle with the warning, but we wore every half hour,\\nand we did not run aground. About midday we passed by Shaykh Hasan\\nal-Marabit\\'s tomb. It is the usual domed and whitewashed building,\\nsurrounded by the hovels of its guardians, standing upon a low flat\\nisland of yellow rock, vividly reminding me of certain scenes in Sind.\\nIts dreary position attracts to it the attention of passing travellers;\\nthe dead saint has a prayer and a Fatihah for the good of his soul, and\\nthe live sinner wends his way with religious refreshment.\\n</p><p>Near sunset the wind came on to blow freshly, and we cast anchor\\ntogether with the Persian pilgrims upon a rock. This was one of the\\ncelebrated coral reefs of the Red Sea, and the sight justified\\nForskal\\'s emphatic description-luxus lususque naturae. It was a huge\\nledge or platform rising but little above the level of the deep; the\\nwater-side was perpendicular as the wall of a fort; and, whilst a\\nfrigate might have floated within a yard of it, every ripple dashed\\nover the reef, replenishing the little basins and hollows in the\\nsurface. The colour of the waves near it was a vivid amethyst. In the\\ndistance the eye rested upon what appeared to be meadows of brilliant\\nflowers resembling those of earth, only far brighter and more lovely.\\nNor was this Land of the Sea wholly desolate. Gulls and terns here swam\\nthe tide; there, seated upon the coral, devoured their prey. In the\\nair, troops of birds contended noisily for a dead flying fish,[FN#14]\\nand in the deep water they chased a shoal, which, in fright and hurry\\nto escape the pursuers, veiled the surface with\\n</p><p>[p.219] spray and foam. And as night came on the scene shifted,\\ndisplaying fresh beauties. Shadows clothed the background, whose\\nfeatures, dimly revealed, allowed full scope to the imagination. In the\\nforepart of the picture lay the sea, shining under the rays of the moon\\nwith a metallic lustre; while its border, where the wavelets dashed\\nupon the reef, was lit by what the Arabs call the \"jewels of the\\ndeep[FN#15]\"-brilliant flashes of phosphoric light giving an idea of\\nsplendour which Art would vainly strive to imitate. Altogether it was a\\nbit of fairyland, a spot for nymphs and sea-gods to disport upon: you\\nmight have heard, without astonishment, old Proteus calling his flocks\\nwith the writhed conch; and Aphrodite seated in her shell would have\\nbeen only a fit and proper climax for its loveliness.\\n</p><p>But-as philosophically remarked by Sir Cauline the Knyghte-\\n</p><p>\"Every whyte must have its blacke,\\nAnd every sweete its soure-\"\\n</p><p>this charming coral reef was nearly being the scene of an ugly\\naccident. The breeze from seaward set us slowly but steadily towards\\nthe reef, a fact of which we soon became conscious. Our anchor was not\\ndragging; it had not rope enough to touch the bottom, and vainly we\\nsought for more. In fact the \"Golden Wire\" was as disgracefully\\ndeficient in all the appliances of safety, as any English merchantman\\nin the nineteenth century,-a circumstance which accounts for the\\nshipwrecks and for the terrible loss of life perpetually occurring\\nabout the Pilgrimage-season in these seas. Had she struck upon the\\nrazor-like edges of the coral-reef, she would have melted\\n</p><p>[p.220] away like a sugar-plum in the ripple, for the tide was rising\\nat the time. Having nothing better to do, we began to make as much\\nnoise as possible. Fortunately for us, the Rais commanding the\\nPersian\\'s boat was an Arab from Jeddah; and more than once we had\\ntreated him with great civility. Guessing the cause of our distress, he\\nsent two sailors overboard with a cable; they swam gallantly up to us;\\nand in a few minutes we were safely moored to the stern of our useful\\nneighbour. Which done, we applied ourselves to the grateful task of\\nbeating our Rais, and richly had he deserved it. Before noon, when the\\nwind was shifting, he had not once given himself the trouble to wear;\\nand when the breeze was falling, he preferred dosing to taking\\nadvantage of what little wind remained. With energy we might have been\\nmoored that night comfortably under the side of Hassani Island, instead\\nof floating about on an unquiet sea with a lee-shore of coral-reef\\nwithin a few yards of our counter.\\n</p><p>At dawn the next day (15th July) we started. We made Jabal\\nHassani[FN#16] about noon, and an hour or so before sunset we glided\\ninto Marsa Mahar. Our resting-place resembled Marsa Dumayghah at an\\nhumble distance; the sides of the cove, however, were bolder and more\\nprecipitous. The limestone rocks presented a peculiar appearance; in\\nsome parts the base and walls had crumbled away, leaving a coping to\\nproject like a canopy; in others the wind and rain had cut deep holes,\\nand pierced the friable material with caverns that looked like the work\\nof art. There was a pretty opening of backwood at the bottom of the\\n</p><p>[p.221] cove; and palm trees in the blue distance gladdened our eyes,\\nwhich pined for the sight of something green. The Rais, as usual, would\\nhave terrified us with a description of the Hutaym tribe that holds\\nthese parts, and I knew from Welsted and Moresby that it is a debased\\nrace. But forty-eight hours of cramps on board ship would make a man\\nthink lightly of a much more imminent danger.\\n</p><p>Wading to shore we cut our feet with the sharp rocks. I remember to\\nhave felt the acute pain of something running into my toe: but after\\nlooking at the place and extracting what appeared to be a bit of\\nthorn,[FN#17] I dismissed the subject, little guessing the trouble it\\nwas to give me. Having scaled the rocky side of the cove, we found some\\nhalf-naked Arabs lying in the shade; they were unarmed, and had nothing\\nabout them except their villainous countenances wherewith to terrify\\nthe most timid. These men still live in limestone caves, like the\\nThamud tribe of tradition; also they are Ichthyophagi, existing without\\nany other subsistence but what the sea affords. They were unable to\\nprovide us with dates, flesh, or milk, but they sold us a kind of fish\\ncalled in India \"Bui\": broiled upon the embers, it proved delicious.\\n</p><p>After we had eaten and drunk and smoked, we began to make merry; and\\nthe Persians, who, fearing to come on shore, had kept to their\\nconveyance, appeared proper butts for the wit of some of our party: one\\nof us stood up and pronounced the orthodox call to prayer, after which\\nthe rest joined in a polemical hymn, exalting the virtues\\n</p><p>[p.222] and dignity of the first three Caliphs.[FN#18] Then, as general\\non such occasions, the matter was made personal by informing the\\nPersians in a kind of rhyme sung by the Meccan gamins, that they were\\nthe \"slippers of Ali and the dogs of Omar.\" But as they were too\\nfrightened to reply, my companions gathered up their cooking utensils,\\nand returned to the \"Golden Wire,\" melancholy, like disappointed\\ncandidates for the honours of Donnybrook.\\n</p><p>Our next day was silent and weary, for we were all surly, and heartily\\nsick of being on board ship. We should have made Yambu\\' in the evening\\nbut for the laziness of the Rais. Having duly beaten him, we anchored\\non the open coast, insufficiently protected by a reef, and almost in\\nsight of our destination. In the distance rose Jabal Radhwah or\\nRadhwa,[FN#19] one of the \"Mountains of Paradise[FN#20]\" in which\\nhonoured Arabia abounds. It is celebrated by poetry as well as by piety.\\n</p><p>\"Did Radhwah strive to support my woes,\\nRadhwah itself would be crushed by the weight,\"\\n</p><p>says Antar.[FN#21] It supplies Al-Madinah with hones. I heard much of\\nits valleys and fruits and bubbling springs, but afterwards I learned\\nto rank these tales with the superstitious legends which are attached\\nto it. Gazing at its bare and ghastly heights, one of our party, whose\\nwit was soured by the want of fresh bread, surlily remarked that such a\\nheap of ugliness deserved ejection from heaven,-an irreverence too\\npublic to escape general denunciation. We waded on shore, cooked there,\\nand\\n</p><p>[p.223] passed the night; we were short of fresh water, which, combined\\nwith other grievances, made us as surly as bears. Sa\\'ad the Demon was\\nespecially vicious; his eyes gazed fixedly on the ground, his lips\\nprotruded till you might have held up his face by them, his mouth was\\ngarnished with bad wrinkles, and he never opened it but he grumbled out\\na wicked word. He solaced himself that evening by crawling slowly on\\nall-fours over the boy Mohammed, taking scrupulous care to place one\\nknee upon the sleeper\\'s face. The youth awoke in a fiery rage: we all\\nroared with laughter; and the sulky Negro, after savouring the success\\nof his spite, grimly, as but half satisfied, rolled himself, like a\\nhedgehog, into a ball; and, resolving to be offensive even in his\\nforgetfulness, snored violently all night.\\n</p><p>We slept upon the sands and arose before dawn (July 17), determined to\\nmake the Rais start in time that day. A slip of land separated us from\\nour haven, but the wind was foul, and by reason of rocks and shoals, we\\nhad to make a considerable detour.\\n</p><p>It was about noon on the twelfth day after our departure from Suez,\\nwhen, after slowly beating up the narrow creek leading to Yambu\\'\\nharbour, we sprang into a shore-boat and felt new life when bidding an\\neternal adieu to the vile \"Golden Wire.\"\\n</p><p>I might have escaped much of this hardship and suffering by hiring a\\nvessel to myself. There would then have been a cabin to retire into at\\nnight, and shade from the sun; moreover, the voyage would have lasted\\nfive, not twelve, days. But I wished to witness the scenes on board a\\npilgrim ship,-scenes so much talked of by the Moslem palmer\\nhome-returned. Moreover, the hire was exorbitant, ranging from L40 to\\nL50, and it would have led to a greater expenditure, as the man who can\\nafford to take a boat must pay in proportion during his lan\\n</p><p>[p.224] journey. In these countries you perforce go on as you begin: to\\n\"break one\\'s expenditure,\" that is to say, to retrench expenses, is\\nconsidered all but impossible. We have now left the land of Egypt.\\n</p><p>[FN#1] The reader who has travelled in the East will feel that I am not\\nexaggerating. And to convince those who know it only by description, I\\nwill refer them to any account of our early campaigns in Sind, where\\nmany a European soldier has been taken up stone dead after sleeping an\\nhour or two in the morning sun.\\n[FN#2] The Zodiacal Light on the Red Sea, and in Bombay, is far\\nbrighter than in England. I suppose this is the \"after-glow\" described\\nby Miss Martineau and other travellers: \"flashes of light like\\ncoruscations of the Aurora Borealis in pyramidal form\" would exactly\\ndescribe the phenomenon. It varies, however, greatly, and often for\\nsome days together is scarcely visible.\\n[FN#3] Niebuhr considers that the stars are brighter in Norway than in\\nthe Arabian deserts; I never saw them so bright as on the Neilgherry\\nhills.\\n[FN#4] Written in the days of the vans, which preceded the Railway.\\n[FN#5] On one occasion I was obliged personally to exert myself to\\nprevent a party of ladies being thrust into an old and bad transit-van;\\nthe ruder sex having stationed itself at some distance from the\\nstarting-place in order to seize upon the best.\\n[FN#6] Abraham, for breaking his father\\'s idols, was cast by Nimrod\\ninto a fiery furnace, which forthwith became a garden of roses.

They extend from the plains north of\\nYambu\\' into the Sinaitic Peninsula. They boast no connection with the\\ngreat tribe Al-Harb; but they are of noble race, are celebrated for\\nfighting, and, it is said, have good horses. The specimens we saw at\\nMarsa Dumayghah were poor ones, they had few clothes, and no arms\\nexcept the usual Jambiyah (crooked dagger). By their civility and their\\ncringing style of address it was easy to see they had been corrupted by\\nintercourse with strangers.\\n[FN#12] It is written Wish and Wejh; by Ali Bey Vadjeh and Wadjih;\\nWodjeh and Wosh by Burckhardt; and Wedge by Moresby.\\n[FN#13] The terrible Afghan knife.\\n[FN#14] These the Arabs, in the vulgar tongue, call Jarad al-Bahr, \"sea\\nlocusts\"; as they term the shrimp Burghut al-Bahr, or the sea-flea.\\nSuch compound words, palpably derived from land objects, prove the\\npresent Ichthyophagi and the Badawin living on the coast to be a race\\noriginally from the interior. Pure and ancient Arabs still have at\\nleast one uncompounded word to express every object familiar to them,\\nand it is in this point that the genius of the language chiefly shows\\nitself.\\n[FN#15] The Arab superstition is, that these flashes of light are\\njewels made to adorn the necks and hair of the mermaids and mermen.\\nWhen removed from their native elements the gems fade and disappear. If\\nI remember right, there is some idea similar to this among the Scotch,\\nand other Northern people.\\n[FN#16] The word Jabal will frequently occur in these pages. It is\\napplied by the Arabs to any rising ground or heap of rocks, and,\\ntherefore, must not always be translated \"Mountain.\" In the latter\\nsense, it has found its way into some of the Mediterranean dialects.\\nGibraltar is Jabal al-Tarik, and \"Mt. Ethne that men clepen Mounte\\nGybelle\" is \"Monte Gibello,\"-the mountain, par excellence.\\n[FN#17] It was most probably a prickle of the \"egg-fruit,\" or Echinus,\\nso common in these seas, generally supposed to be poisonous.

But traveller\\'s duty was to be done;\\nso, leaning upon my \"slave\\'s\" shoulder, I started at once to see the\\ntown, whilst Shaykh Hamid and the others of our party proceeded to the\\ncustom-house.\\n</p><p>Yanbu\\'a al-Bahr, Yambu\\' or Fountain of the Sea,[FN#1] identified, by\\nAbyssinian Bruce, with the Iambia village of Ptolemy, is a place of\\nconsiderable importance, and shares with others the title of \"Gate of\\nthe Holy City.\" It is the third quarter of the caravan road[FN#2] from\\nCairo to Meccah; and here, as well as at Al-Badr, pilgrims frequently\\nleave behind them, in hired warehouses, goods too heavy to be\\ntransported in haste, or too valuable to risk in dangerous times.\\nYambu\\' being the port of Al-Madinah,\\n</p><p>[p.226] as Jeddah is of Meccah, is supported by a considerable\\ntransport trade and extensive imports from the harbours on the Western\\ncoasts of the Red Sea; it supplies its chief town with grain, dates,\\nand henna. Here the Sultan\\'s dominion is supposed to begin, whilst the\\nauthority of the Pasha of Egypt ceases; there is no Nizam, or Regular\\nArmy, however, in the town,[FN#3] and the governor is a Sharif or Arab\\nchief. I met him in the great bazar; he is a fine young man of light\\ncomplexion and the usual high profile, handsomely dressed, with a\\nCashmere turband, armed to the extent of sword and dagger, and followed\\nby two large, fierce-looking Negro slaves leaning upon enormous Nabbuts.\\n</p><p>The town itself is in no wise remarkable. Built on the edge of a\\nsunburnt plain that extends between the mountains and the sea, it\\nfronts the northern extremity of a narrow winding creek. Viewed from\\nthe harbour, it is a long line of buildings, whose painful whiteness is\\nset off by a sky-like cobalt and a sea-like indigo; behind it lies the\\nflat, here of a bistre-brown, there of a lively tawny; whilst the\\nbackground is formed by dismal Radhwah,\\n</p><p>\"Barren and bare, unsightly, unadorned.\"\\n</p><p>Outside the walls are a few little domes and tombs, which by no means\\nmerit attention. Inside, the streets are wide; and each habitation is\\nplaced at an unsociable distance from its neighbour, except near the\\nport and the bazars, where ground is valuable. The houses are roughly\\nbuilt of limestone and coralline, and their walls full of fossils\\ncrumble like almond cake; they have huge\\n</p><p>[p.227] hanging windows, and look mean after those in the Moslem\\nquarters of Cairo. There is a \"Suk,\" or market-street of the usual\\nform, a long narrow lane darkened by a covering of palm leaves, with\\nlittle shops let into the walls of the houses on both sides. The cafes,\\nwhich abound here, have already been described in the last chapter;\\nthey are rendered dirty in the extreme by travellers, and it is\\nimpossible to sit in them without a fan to drive away the flies. The\\ncustom-house fronts the landing-place upon the harbour; it is managed\\nby Turkish officials,-men dressed in Tarbushes, who repose the livelong\\nday upon the Diwans near the windows. In the case of us travellers they\\nhad a very simple way of doing business, charging each person of the\\nparty three piastres for each large box, but by no means troubling\\nthemselves to meddle with the contents.[FN#4] Yambu\\' also boasts of a\\nHammam or hot bath, a mere date-leaf shed, tenanted by an old Turk,\\nwho, with his surly Albanian assistant, lives by \"cleaning\" pilgrims\\nand travellers. Some whitewashed Mosques and Minarets of exceedingly\\nsimple form, a Wakalah or two for the reception of merchants, and a\\nsaint\\'s tomb, complete the list of public buildings.\\n</p><p>In one point Yambu\\' claims superiority over most other towns in this\\npart of Al-Hijaz. Those who can afford the luxury drink sweet\\nrain-water, collected amongst the hills in tanks and cisterns, and\\nbrought on camelback to the town. Two sources are especially praised,\\nthe Ayn al-Birkat and the Ayn Ali, which suffice to supply the whole\\npopulation: the brackish water of the wells is confined to coarser\\npurposes. Some of the old people here, as at Suez, are said to prefer\\nthe drink to which\\n</p><p>[p.228] years of habit have accustomed them, and it is a standing joke\\nthat, arrived at Cairo, they salt the water of the Nile to make it\\npalatable.\\n</p><p>The population of Yambu\\'-one of the most bigoted and quarrelsome races\\nin Al-Hijaz-strikes the eye after arriving from Egypt, as decidedly a\\nnew feature. The Shaykh or gentleman is over-armed and over-dressed, as\\nFashion, the Tyrant of the Desert as well as of the Court, dictates to\\na person of his consequence. The civilised traveller from Al-Madinah\\nsticks in his waist-shawl a loaded pistol,[FN#5] garnished with crimson\\nsilk cord, but he partially conceals the butt-end under the flap of his\\njacket. The Irregular soldier struts down the street a small armoury of\\nweapons: one look at the man\\'s countenance suffices to tell you what he\\nis. Here and there stalk grim Badawin, wild as their native wastes, and\\nin all the dignity of pride and dirt; they also are armed to the teeth,\\nand even the presence of the policeman\\'s quarterstaff[FN#6] cannot keep\\ntheir swords in their scabbards. What we should call the peaceful part\\nof the population never leave the house without the \"Nabbut\" over the\\nright shoulder, and the larger, the longer, and the heavier the weapon\\nis, the more gallantry does the bearer claim. The people of Yambu\\'\\npractise the use of this implement diligently; they become expert in\\ndelivering\\n</p><p>[p.229] a head-blow so violent as to break through any guard, and with\\nit they always decide their trivial quarrels.[FN#7] The dress of the\\nwomen differs but little from that of the Egyptians, except in the face\\nveil,[FN#8] which is generally white. There is an independent bearing\\nabout the Yambu\\' men, strange in the East; they are proud without\\ninsolence, and they look manly without blustering. Their walk partakes\\nsomewhat of the nature of a swagger, owing, perhaps, to the shape of\\nthe sandals, not a little assisted by the self-esteem of the wearer,\\nbut there is nothing offensive in it: moreover, the population has a\\nhealthy appearance, and, fresh from Egypt, I could not help noticing\\ntheir freedom from ophthalmic disease. The children, too, appear\\nvigorous, nor are they here kept in that state of filth to which fear\\nof the Evil Eye devotes them in the Valley of the Nile.\\n</p>\\n<div class=\"floatright\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Burton_Shaykh.PNG\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Burton Shaykh.PNG\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/Burton_Shaykh.PNG/250px-Burton_Shaykh.PNG\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"250\" height=\"281\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/Burton_Shaykh.PNG 1.5x\" data-file-width=\"261\" data-file-height=\"293\" /></a></div>\\n<p>My companions found me in a coffee-house, where I had sat down to rest\\nfrom the fatigue of halting on my wounded foot through the town. They\\nhad passed their boxes through the custom-house, and were now inquiring\\nin all directions, \"Where\\'s the Effendi?\" After sitting for half an\\nhour, we rose to depart, when an old Arab merchant, whom I had met at\\nSuez, politely insisted upon paying for my coffee, still a mark of attention in Arabia\\nas it was whilome in France. We then went to a Wakalah, near the bazar,\\nin which my companions had secured an airy upper room on the terrace\\nopposite the sea, and tolerably free from Yambu\\'s plague, the flies. It\\nhad been tenanted by a party of travellers, who were introduced to me\\nas Omar Effendi\\'s brothers; he had by accident met them in the streets\\nthe day before their start for Constantinople, where they were\\ntravelling to receive the Ikram.[FN#9] The family was, as I have said\\nbefore, from Daghistan (Circassia), and the male members still showed\\nunequivocal signs of a northern origin, in light yellowish skins, grey\\neyes fringed with dark lashes, red lips, and a very scant beard. They\\nwere broad-shouldered, large-limbed men, distinguished only by a\\npeculiar surliness of countenance; perhaps their expression was the\\nresult of their suspecting me; for I observed them narrowly watching\\nevery movement during Wuzu and prayers. This was a good opportunity for\\ndisplaying the perfect nonchalance of a True Believer; and my efforts\\nwere, I believe, successful, for afterwards they seemed to treat me as\\na mere stranger, from whom they could expect nothing, and who therefore\\nwas hardly worth their notice.\\n</p><p>On the afternoon of the day of our arrival we sent for a\\nMukharrij,[FN#10] (hirer of conveyance) and began to treat for camels.\\nOne Amm Jamal, a respectable native of Al-Madinah who was on his way\\nhome, undertook to be the spokesman; after a long palaver (for\\n</p><p>[p.231] the Shaykh of the camels and his attendant Badawin were men\\nthat fought for farthings, and we were not far inferior to them), a\\nbargain was struck. We agreed to pay three dollars for each beast; half\\nin ready money, the other half after reaching our destination, and to\\nstart on the evening of the next day with a grain-caravan, guarded by\\nan escort of Irregular cavalry. I hired two animals, one for my luggage\\nand servant, the other for the boy Mohammed and myself, expressly\\nstipulating that we were to ride the better beast, and that if it broke\\ndown on the road, its place should be supplied by another as good. My\\nfriends could not dissemble their uneasiness, when informed by the\\nMukharrij that the Hazimi tribe was \"out,\" and that travellers had to\\nfight every day. The Daghistanis also contributed to their alarm. \"We\\nmet,\" said they, \"between 200 and 300 devils on a Razzia near\\nAl-Madinah; we gave them the Salam, but they would not reply, although\\nwe were all on dromedaries. Then they asked us if we were men of\\nAl-Madinah, and we replied \\xef\\xbf\\xbdYes;\\' and lastly, they wanted to know the\\nend of our journey; so we said Bir Abbas.[FN#11]\" The Badawin who had\\naccompanied the Daghistanis belonged to some tribe unconnected with the\\nHazimi: the spokesman rolled his head, as much as to say \"Allah has\\npreserved us!\" And a young Indian of the party-I shrewdly suspect him\\nof having stolen my pen-knife that night-displayed\\n</p><p>[p.232] the cowardice of a \"Miyan,[FN#12]\" by looking aghast at the\\nmemory of his imminent and deadly risk. \"Sir,\" said Shaykh Nur to me,\\n\"we must wait till all this is over.\" I told him to hold his tongue,\\nand sharply reproved the boy Mohammed, upon whose manner the effect of\\nfinding himself suddenly in a fresh country had wrought a change for\\nthe worse. \"Why, ye were lions at Cairo; and here, at Yambu\\', you are\\ncats-hens![FN#13]\" It was not long, however, before the youth\\'s\\nimpudence returned upon him with increased violence.\\n</p><p>We sat through the afternoon in the little room on the terrace, whose\\nreflected heat, together with the fiery winds from the Wilderness,\\nseemed to incommode even my companions. After sunset we dined in the\\nopen air, a body of twenty: master, servants, children and strangers.\\nAll the procurable rugs and pillows had been seized to make a Diwan,\\nand we squatted together round a large cauldron of boiled rice,\\ncontaining square masses of mutton, the whole covered with clarified\\nbutter. Sa\\'ad the Demon was now in his glory. With what anecdotes the\\noccasion supplied him! His tongue seemed to wag with a perpetual\\nmotion; for each man he had a boisterous greeting; and, to judge from\\nhis whisperings, he must have been in every one\\'s privacy and\\nconfidence. Conversation over pipes and coffee was prolonged to ten\\nP.M., a late hour in these lands; then we prayed the Isha[FN#14] (or vespers), and, spreading our mats upon the terrace, slept in the open air.\\n</p>\\n<div class=\"floatright\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Burton_minicamel.PNG\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Burton minicamel.PNG\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/Burton_minicamel.PNG/200px-Burton_minicamel.PNG\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"200\" height=\"237\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/Burton_minicamel.PNG/300px-Burton_minicamel.PNG 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dc/Burton_minicamel.PNG 2x\" data-file-width=\"331\" data-file-height=\"393\" /></a></div>\\n<p>The forenoon of the next day was occupied in making sundry small\\npurchases. We laid in seven days\\' provisions for the journey; repacked\\nour boxes, polished and loaded our arms, and attired ourselves\\nappropriately for the road. By the advice of Amm Jamal[FN#15] I dressed\\nas an Arab, in order to avoid paying the Jizyat, a capitation tax\\n[FN#16] which, upon this road, the settled tribes extort from stranger\\ntravellers; and he warned me not to speak any language but Arabic, even\\nto my \"slave,\" in the vicinity of a village. I bought for my own\\nconvenience a Shugduf or litter[FN#17] for which I paid two dollars. It\\nis a\\n</p><p>[p.234] vehicle appropriated to women and children, fathers of\\nfamilies, married men, \"Shelebis,[FN#18]\" and generally to those who\\nare too effeminate to ride. My reason for choosing a litter was that\\nnotes are more easily taken in it than on a dromedary\\'s back; the\\nexcuse of lameness prevented it detracting from my manhood, and I was\\ncareful when entering any populous place to borrow or hire a saddled\\nbeast.\\n</p><p>Our party dined early that day, for the camels had been sitting at the\\ngate since noon. We had the usual trouble in loading them: the owners\\nof the animals vociferating about the unconscionable weight, the owners\\nof the goods swearing that a child could carry such weight, while the\\nbeasts, taking part with their proprietors, moaned piteously, roared,\\nmade vicious attempts to bite, and started up with an agility that\\nthrew the half-secured boxes or sacks headlong to the ground. About 3\\nP.M. all was ready-the camels formed into Indian file were placed\\nstanding in the streets. But, as usual with Oriental travellers, all\\nthe men dispersed about the town: we did not mount before it was late\\nin the afternoon.\\n</p><p>I must now take the liberty of presenting to the reader an Arab Shaykh\\nfully equipped for travelling.[FN#19] Nothing can be more picturesque\\nthan the costume, and\\n</p><p>[p.235] it is with regret that we see it exchanged in the towns and\\nmore civilised parts for any other. The long locks or the shaven scalps\\nare surmounted by a white cotton skull-cap, over which is a Kufiyah-a\\nlarge square kerchief of silk and cotton mixed, and generally of a dull\\nred colour with a bright yellow border, from which depend crimson silk\\ntwists ending in little tassels that reach the wearer\\'s waist. Doubled\\ninto a triangle, and bound with an Aakal[FN#20] or fillet of rope, a\\nskein of yarn or a twist of wool, the kerchief fits the head close\\nbehind: it projects over the forehead, shading the eyes, and giving a\\nfierce look to the countenance. On certain occasions one end is brought\\nround the lower part of the face, and is fastened behind the head. This\\nveiling the features is technically called Lisam: the chiefs generally\\nfight so, and it is the usual disguise when a man fears the avenger of\\nblood, or a woman starts to take her Sar.[FN#21] In hot weather it is\\nsupposed to keep the Samun, in cold weather the catarrh, from the lungs.\\n</p>\\n<div class=\"floatleft\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Jambiyah_Burton.PNG\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Jambiyah Burton.PNG\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/Jambiyah_Burton.PNG/200px-Jambiyah_Burton.PNG\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"200\" height=\"65\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/Jambiyah_Burton.PNG/300px-Jambiyah_Burton.PNG 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/Jambiyah_Burton.PNG/400px-Jambiyah_Burton.PNG 2x\" data-file-width=\"420\" data-file-height=\"136\" /></a></div><p>The body dress is simply a Kamis or cotton shirt: tight sleeved, opening in front, and adorned round the waist and collar, and down the breast, with embroidery like net-work; it extends from neck to foot. Some wear wide trousers, but the Badawin consider such things\\n</p><p>effeminate, and they have not yet fallen into the folly of socks and stockings. Over the Kamis is thrown a long-skirted and short-sleeved cloak of camel\\'s hair, called an Aba. It is made in many patterns, and of all materials from pure silk to coarse sheep\\'s wool; some prefer it brown, others white, others striped: in Al-Hijaz the favourite hue is\\nwhite, embroidered with gold,[FN#22] tinsel, or yellow thread in two\\nlarge triangles, capped with broad bands and other figures running down\\nthe shoulders and sides of the back. It is lined inside the shoulders\\nand breast with handsome stuffs of silk and cotton mixed, and is tied\\nin front by elaborate strings, and tassels or acorns of silk and gold.\\nA sash confines the Kamis at the waist, and supports the silver-hilted\\nJambiyah[FN#23] or crooked dagger: the picturesque Arab sandal[FN#24]\\ncompletes the costume. Finally, the\\n</p><p>[p.237] Shaykh\\'s arms are a sword and a matchlock slung behind his\\nback; in his right hand he carries a short javelin[FN#25] or a light\\ncrooked stick, about two feet and a half long, called a Mas\\'hab,[FN#26]\\nused for guiding camels.\\n</p><p>The poorer clans of Arabs twist round their waist, [p.238] next to the\\nskin, a long plait of greasy leather, to support the back; and they\\ngird the shirt at the middle merely with a cord, or with a coarse sash.\\nThe dagger is stuck in this scarf, and a bandoleer slung over the\\nshoulders carries the cartridge-case, powder-flask, flint and steel,\\npriming-horn, and other necessaries. With the traveller, the waist is\\nan elaborate affair. Next to the skin is worn the money-pouch,\\nconcealed by the Kamis; the latter is girt with a waist shawl, over\\nwhich is strapped a leathern belt.[FN#27] The latter article should\\nalways be well garnished with a pair of long-barrelled and\\nsilver-mounted flint pistols,[FN#28] a large and a small dagger, and an\\n</p><p>[p.239] iron ramrod with pincers inside; a little leathern pouch\\nfastened to the waist-strap on the right side contains cartridge,\\nwadding, and flask of priming powder. The sword hangs over the shoulder\\nby crimson silk cords and huge tassels[FN#29]: well-dressed men apply\\nthe same showy ornaments to their pistols. In the hand may be borne a\\nbell-mouthed blunderbuss; or, better still, a long single-barrel gun\\nwith an ounce bore. All these weapons must shine like silver, if you\\nwish to be respected; for the knightly care of arms is here a sign of\\nmanliness.\\n</p><p>Pilgrims, especially those from Turkey, carry, I have said, a \"Hamail,\"\\nto denote their holy errand. This is a pocket Koran, in a handsome\\ngold-embroidered crimson velvet or red morocco case, slung by red silk\\ncords over the left shoulder. It must hang down by the right side, and\\nshould never depend below the waist-belt. For this I substituted a most\\nuseful article. To all appearance a \"Hamail,\" it had inside three\\ncompartments; one for my watch and compass, the second for ready money,\\nand the third contained penknife, pencils, and slips of paper, which I\\ncould hold concealed in the hollow of my hand. These were for writing\\nand drawing: opportunities of making a \"fair copy\" into the\\ndiary-book,[FN#30] are never wanting to the acute traveller. He\\n</p><p>[p.240] must, however, beware of sketching before the Badawin, who\\nwould certainly proceed to extreme measures, suspecting him to be a spy\\nor a sorcerer.[FN#31] Nothing so effectually puzzles these people as\\nthe Frankish habit of putting everything on paper; their imaginations\\nare set at work, and then the worst may be expected from them. The only\\nsafe way of writing in presence of a Badawi would be when drawing out a\\nhoroscope or preparing a charm; he also objects not, if you can warm\\nhis heart upon the subject, to seeing you take notes in a book of\\ngenealogies. You might begin with, \"And you, men of Harb, on what\\norigin do you pride yourselves?\" And while the listeners became fluent\\nupon the, to them, all-interesting\\n</p><p>[p.241] theme, you could put down whatever you please upon the margin.\\nThe townspeople are more liberal, and years ago the Holy Shrines have\\nbeen drawn, surveyed and even lithographed, by Eastern artists: still,\\nif you wish to avoid all suspicion, you must rarely be seen with pen or\\nwith pencil in hand.\\n</p><p>At 6 P.M., descending the stairs of our Wakalah, we found the camels\\nstanding loaded in the street, and shifting their ground in token of\\nimpatience.[FN#32] My Shugduf, perched upon the back of a tall strong\\nanimal, nodded and swayed about with his every motion, impressing me\\nwith the idea that the first step would throw it over the shoulders or\\nthe crupper. The camel-man told me I must climb up the animal\\'s neck,\\nand so creep into the vehicle. But my foot disabling me from such\\nexertion, I insisted upon their bringing the beast to squat, which they\\ndid grumblingly.[FN#33] We took leave of Omar Effendi\\'s brothers and\\ntheir dependents, who insisted upon paying us the compliment of\\naccompanying us to the gate. Then we mounted and started, which was a\\nsignal for all our party to disperse once more. Some heard the report\\nof a vessel having arrived from Suez, with Mohammed Shiklibha and other\\nfriends on board; these hurried down to the harbour for a parting word.\\nOthers, declaring they had forgotten some necessaries for the way, ran\\noff to spend one last hour in gossip at the coffee-house. Then the sun\\nset, and prayers must be said. The brief twilight had almost faded away\\nbefore all had mounted. With loud cries of \"Wassit, ya hu!-\\n</p><p>[p.242] Go in the middle of the road, O He!\" and \"Jannib, y\\'al\\nJammal[FN#34]!-Keep to the side, O camel-man!\" we threaded our way\\nthrough long, dusty, narrow streets, flanked with white-washed\\nhabitations at considerable intervals, and large heaps of rubbish,\\nsometimes higher than the houses. We were stopped at the gate to\\nascertain if we were strangers, in which case, the guard would have\\ndone his best to extract a few piastres before allowing our luggage to\\npass; but he soon perceived by my companions\\' accent, that they were\\nSons of the Holy City,-consequently, that the case was hopeless. While\\nstanding here, Shaykh Hamid vaunted the strong walls and turrets of\\nYambu\\', which he said were superior to those of Jeddah[FN#35]: they\\nkept Sa\\'ud, the Wahhabi, at bay in A.D. 1802, but would scarcely, I\\nshould say, resist a field battery in A.D. 1853. The moon rose fair and\\nclear, dazzling us with light as we emerged from the shadowy streets;\\nand when we launched into the Desert, the sweet air delightfully\\ncontrasted with the close offensive atmosphere of the town. My\\ncompanions, as Arabs will do on such occasions, began to sing.\\n</p><p>[FN#1] Yanbu\\'a in Arabic is \"a Fountain.\" Yanbu\\'a of the Sea is so\\ncalled to distinguish it from \"Yanbu\\'a of the Palm-Grounds,\" a village\\nat the foot of the mountains, about 18 or 20 miles distant from the\\nsea-port. Ali Bey places it one day\\'s journey E.1/4N.E. from Yanbu\\'a\\nal-Bahr, and describes it as a pleasant place in a fertile valley. It\\nis now known as Yambu\\'a al-Nakhil. See \"The Land of Midian (Revisited).\"\\n[FN#2] The first quarter of the Cairo caravan is Al-Akabah; the second\\nis the Manhal Salmah (Salmah\\'s place for watering camels); the third is\\nYambu\\'; and the fourth Meccah.\\n[FN#3] The Nizam, as Europeans now know, is the regular Turkish\\ninfantry. In Al-Hijaz, these troops are not stationed in small towns\\nlike Yambu\\'. At such places a party of Irregular horse, for the purpose\\nof escorting travellers, is deemed sufficient. The Yambu\\' police seems\\nto consist of the Sharif\\'s sturdy negroes. In Ali Bey\\'s time Yambu\\'\\nbelonged to the Sharif of Meccah, and was garrisoned by him.\\n[FN#4] This, as far as I could learn, is the only tax which the\\nSultan\\'s government derives from the northern Hijaz; the people declare\\nit to be, as one might expect at this distance from the capital, liable\\nto gross peculation. When the Wahhabis held Yambu\\', they assessed it,\\nlike all other places; for which reason their name is held in the\\nliveliest abhorrence.\\n[FN#5] Civilians usually stick one pistol in the belt; soldiers and\\nfighting men two, or more, with all the necessary concomitants of\\npouches, turnscrews, and long iron ramrods, which, opening with a\\nscrew, disclose a long thin pair of pincers, wherewith fire is put upon\\nthe chibuk.\\n[FN#6] The weapons with which nations are to be managed form a curious\\nconsideration. The Englishman tamely endures a staff, which would make\\na Frenchman mad with anger; and a Frenchman respects a sabre, which\\nwould fill an Englishman\\'s bosom with civilian spleen. You order the\\nEgyptian to strip and be flogged; he makes no objection to seeing his\\nblood flow in this way; but were a cutting weapon used, his friends\\nwould stop at nothing in their fury.\\n[FN#7] In Arabia, generally, the wound is less considered by justice\\nand revenge, than the instrument with which it was inflicted. Sticks\\nand stones are held to be venial weapons: guns and pistols, swords and\\ndaggers, are felonious.\\n[FN#8] Europeans inveigh against this article,-which represents the\\n\"loup\" of Louis XIV.\\'s time,-for its hideousness and jealous\\nconcealment of charms made to be admired. It is, on the contrary, the\\nmost coquettish article of woman\\'s attire, excepting, perhaps, the\\nLisam of Constantinople. It conceals coarse skins, fleshy noses, wide\\nmouths, and vanishing chins, whilst it sets off to best advantage what\\nin these lands is almost always lustrous and liquid-the eye. Who has\\nnot remarked this at a masquerade ball?\\n[FN#9] A certain stipend allowed by the Sultan to citizens of the\\nHaramayn (Meccah and Al-Madinah). It will be treated of at length in a\\nfuture chapter.\\n[FN#10] The Shaykh, or agent of the camels, without whose assistance it\\nwould be difficult to hire beasts. He brings the Badawin with him;\\ntalks them over to fair terms; sees the \"Arbun,\" or earnest-money,\\ndelivered to them; and is answerable for their not failing in their\\nengagement.\\n[FN#11] The not returning \"Salam\" was a sign on the part of the Badawin\\nthat they were out to fight, and not to make friends; and the dromedary\\nriders, who generally travel without much to rob, thought this\\nbehaviour a declaration of desperate designs. The Badawin asked if they\\nwere Al-Madinah men; because the former do not like, unless when\\nabsolutely necessary, to plunder the people of the Holy City. And the\\nDaghistanis said their destination was Bir Abbas, a neighbouring,\\ninstead of Yambu\\', a distant post, because those who travel on a long\\njourney, being supposed to have more funds with them, are more likely\\nto be molested.\\n[FN#12] \"Miyan,\" the Hindustani word for \"Sir,\" is known to the Badawin\\nall over Al-Hijaz; they always address Indian Moslems with this word,\\nwhich has become contemptuous, on account of the low esteem in which\\nthe race is held.\\n[FN#13] That is to say, sneaks and cowards. I was astonished to see our\\nMaghrabi fellow-passengers in the bazar at Yambu\\' cringing and bowing\\nto us, more like courtiers than Badawin. Such, however, is the effect\\nof a strange place upon Orientals generally. In the Persians such\\nhumility was excusable; in no part of Al-Hijaz are they for a moment\\nsafe from abuse and blows.\\n[FN#14] The night prayer.\\n[FN#15] \"Amm\" means literally a paternal uncle. In the Hijaz it is\\nprefixed to the names of respectable men, who may also be addressed \"Ya\\nAmm Jamal!\" (O Uncle Jamal!) To say \"Ya Ammi!\" (O my Uncle!) is more\\nfamiliar, and would generally be used by a superior addressing an\\ninferior.\\n[FN#16] Jizyat properly means the capitation tax levied on Infidels; in\\nthis land of intense pride, the Badawin, and even the town-chiefs,\\napply the opprobrious term to blackmail extorted from travellers, even\\nof their own creed.\\n[FN#17] The Shugduf of Al-Hijaz differs greatly from that used in Syria\\nand other countries. It is composed of two corded cots 5 feet long,\\nslung horizontally, about half-way down, and parallel with the camel\\'s\\nsides. These cots have short legs, and at the halt may be used as\\nbedsteads; the two are connected together by loose ropes, attached to\\nthe inner long sides of the framework, and these are thrown over the\\ncamel\\'s packsaddle. Thick twigs inserted in the ends and the outer long\\nsides of the framework, are bent over the top, bower-fashion, to\\nsupport matting, carpets, and any other protection against the sun.\\nThere is an opening in this kind of wicker-work in front (towards the\\ncamel\\'s head), through which you creep; and a similar one behind\\ncreates a draught of wind. Outside, towards the camel\\'s tail, are\\npockets containing gullehs, or earthenware bottles, of cooled water.\\nInside, attached to the wickerwork, are large provision pouches,\\nsimilar to those used in old-fashioned travelling chariots. At the\\nbottom are spread the two beds. The greatest disadvantage of the\\nShugduf is the difficulty of keeping balance. Two men ride in it, and\\ntheir weights must be made to tally. Moreover, it is liable to be\\ncaught and torn by thorn trees, to be blown off in a gale of wind; and\\nits awkwardness causes the camel repeated falls, which are most likely\\nto smash it. Yet it is not necessarily an uncomfortable machine. Those\\nfor sale in the bazar are, of course, worthless, being made of badly\\nseasoned wood. But private litters are sometimes pleasant vehicles,\\nwith turned and painted framework, silk cordage, and valuable carpets.\\nThe often described \"Mahmil\" is nothing but a Syrian Shugduf, royally\\nornamented.\\n[FN#18] \" Exquisites.\"\\n[FN#19] It is the same rule with the Arab, on the road as at home; the\\nmore he is dressed the greater is his respectability. For this reason,\\nyou see Sharifs and other men of high family, riding or walking in\\ntheir warm camel\\'s hair robes on the hottest days. Another superstition\\nof the Arabs is this, that thick clothes avert the evil effects of the\\nsun\\'s beams, by keeping out heat. To the kindness of a friend-Thomas\\nSeddon-I owe the admirable sketch of an \"Arab Shaykh in his Travelling\\nDress.\"\\n[FN#20] Sharifs and other great men sometimes bind a white turband or a\\nCashmere shawl round the kerchief, to keep it in its place. The Aakal\\nvaries in every part of the country. Here it is a twist of dyed wool,\\nthere a bit of common rope, three or four feet long. Some of the Arab\\ntribes use a circlet of wood, composed of little round pieces, the size\\nof a shilling, joined side by side, and inlaid with mother-of-pearl.\\nThe Eastern Arabs wear a large circle of brown wool, almost a turband\\nin itself. In Barbary, they twist brightcoloured cloth round a rope,\\nand adorn it with thick golden thread.\\n[FN#21] Generally written \"Thar,\" the blood-revenge right, acknowledged\\nby law and custom. (See Chapter xxiv. post.)\\n[FN#22] Gold, however, as well as silk, I may be excused for repeating,\\nis a forbidden article of ornament to the Moslem.\\n[FN#23] The silver-hilted dagger is a sign of dignity: \"I would silver\\nmy dagger,\" in idiomatic Hijazi, means, \"I would raise myself in the\\nworld.\"\\n[FN#24] Niebuhr has accurately described this article. It is still worn\\nin the Madras army, though long discarded from the other presidencies;\\nthe main difference between the Indian and the Arab sandal is, that the\\nformer has a ring, into which the big toe is inserted, and the latter a\\nthong, which is clasped between the big toe and its neighbour. Both of\\nthem are equally uncomfortable, and equally injurious to soldiers,\\nwhose legs fight as much as do their arms. They abrade the skin\\nwherever the straps touch, expose the feet to the sun, wind, and rain,\\nand admit thorns and flints to the toes and toe-nails. In Arabia, the\\ntraveller may wear, if he pleases, slippers, but they are considered\\ntownsman-like and effeminate. They must be of the usual colours, red or\\nyellow. Black shoes, though almost universally worn by the Turks at\\nCairo and Constantinople, would most probably excite suspicion in\\nAl-Hijaz.\\n[FN#25] The Mizrak, as it is called, is peculiar to certain tribes, as\\nthe Karashi and the Lahyami, and some, like the Hudayli near Meccah,\\nmake very pretty as well as very useful darts. The head is 15 or 16\\ninches long, nowhere broader than an inch, and tapering gradually to a\\nfine point; its shape is two shallow prisms joined at their bases, and\\nits socket, round like that of all lances, measures a little less than\\n2 inches. The lower third of the blade only is adorned with bars,\\nlozenges, and cones of brass let into the iron in zig-zag and other\\nfigures. The shaft is of hard pliant wood-I do not know of what\\ntree-well seasoned with grease and use; it is 23 inches long, and\\nstrengthened and adorned at distances of half an inch apart by bands of\\nfine brass wire, about one inch and a half long. The heel of the weapon\\nis a blunt spike 14 inches long, used to stick it in the ground, and\\nthis, as well as the lower third of the blade, is ornamented with brass\\nwork. Being well balanced, the Mizrak is a highly efficient weapon for\\nthrowing in hunting, and by its handsome appearance adds not a little\\nto the bearer\\'s dignity. But the stranger must be careful how he so\\narms himself. Unless he be undistinguishable from a Badawi, by carrying\\na weapon peculiar to certain clans, he will expose himself to\\nsuspicion, or to laughter. And to offend an Arab of Al-Hijaz mortally,\\nyou have only to say bluntly, \"Sell me thy spear.\" The proper style of\\naddress to the man whose necessities compel him to break through one of\\nhis \"points d\\'honneur,\" is to say, \"Give me that javelin, and I will\\nsatisfy thee;\" after which he will haggle for each copper piece as\\nthough you were cheapening a sheep.\\n[FN#26] The Mas\\'hab is of almond, generally brought from Syria; at the\\nthick end is a kind of crook, formed by cutting off a bit of the larger\\nbranch from which the stick grows. This crook is afterwards cut into\\nthe shape useful to seize a camel\\'s nose-ring, or a horse\\'s bridle.\\nArabs of all degrees are fond of carrying these sticks. [It is also\\ncalled Maghin.]\\n</p>\\n<pre>[FN#27] This article, the Silahlik of the Turks, is composed of\\n</pre>\\n<p>several oblong pieces of leather cut out to fit the front part of the\\nbody; between each fold there is room enough to stick a weapon; a\\nsubstantial strap fastens it round the waist, and it serves to defend\\nthe sash or the shirt from iron mould, and the stains of gunpowder. It\\nis made of all kinds of material, from plain Morocco leather to the\\nrichest velvet embroidered with gold.\\n[FN#28] It is as well to have a good pair of Turkish barrels and\\nstocks, fitted up with locks of European manufacture; those made by\\nnatives of these countries can never be depended upon. The same will\\napply to the gun or rifle. Upon the whole, it is more prudent to have\\nflint locks. Copper caps are now sold in the bazars of Meccah and\\nAl-Madinah, where a Colt\\'s \"six-shooter\" might excite attention for a\\nday; but were the owner in a position to despise notoriety, he might\\ndisplay it everywhere without danger. One of our guards, who was killed\\non the road, had a double-barrelled English fowling-piece. Still, when\\ndoubts must not be aroused, the traveller will do well to avoid, even\\nin the civilised Hijaz, suspicious appearances in his weapons. I\\ncarried in a secret pocket a small pistol with a spring dagger, upon\\nwhich dependence could be placed, and I was careful never to show it,\\ndischarging it and loading it always in the dark. Some men wear a\\nlittle dagger strapped round the leg, below the knee. Its use is this:\\nwhen the enemy gets you under, he can prevent you bringing your hand up\\nto the weapon in your waist-belt; but before he cuts your throat, you\\nmay slip your fingers down to the knee, and persuade him to stop by a\\nstab in the perineum. This knee dagger is required only in very\\ndangerous places. The article I chiefly accused myself of forgetting\\nwas a stout English clasp-knife, with a large handle, a blade like an\\n\"Arkansas toothpick,\" and possessing the other useful appliances of\\npicker, fleam, tweezers, lancet, and punch.\\n[FN#29] Called \"Habak\": these cords are made in great quantities at\\nCairo, which possesses a special bazar for them, and are exported to\\nall the neighbouring countries, where their price considerably\\nincreases. A handsome pistol-cord, with its tassels, costs about 12\\nshillings in Egypt; at Meccah, or Al-Madinah, the same would fetch\\nupwards of a pound sterling.\\n[FN#30] My diary-book was made up for me by a Cairene; it was a long\\nthin volume fitting into a breast-pocket, where it could be carried\\nwithout being seen. I began by writing notes in the Arabic character,\\nbut as no risk appeared, my journal was afterwards kept in English.\\nMore than once, by way of experiment, I showed the writing on a loose\\nslip of paper to my companions, and astonished them with the strange\\ncharacter derived from Solomon and Alexander, the Lord of the Two\\nHorns, which we Afghans still use. For a short trip a pencil suffices;\\non long journeys ink is necessary; the latter article should be\\nEnglish, not Eastern, which is washed out clean the first time your\\nluggage is thoroughly soaked with rain. The traveller may use either\\nthe Persian or the brass Egyptian inkstand; the latter, however, is\\npreferable, being stronger and less likely to break. But, unless he be\\ncapable of writing and reading a letter correctly, it would be\\nunadvisable to stick such an article in the waist-belt, as this gives\\nout publicly that he is a scribe. When sketching, the pencil is the\\nbest, because the simplest and shortest mode of operation is required.\\nImportant lines should afterwards be marked with ink, as \"fixing\" is\\nimpossible on such journeys. For prudence sake, when my sketches were\\nmade, I cut up the paper into square pieces, numbered them for future\\nreference, and hid them in the tin canisters that contained my\\nmedicines.\\n[FN#31] An accident of this kind happened not long ago, in Hazramaut,\\nto a German traveller who shall be nameless. He had the mortification\\nto see his sketch-book, the labour of months, summarily appropriated\\nand destroyed by the Arabs. I was told by a Hazramaut man at Cairo, and\\nby several at Aden, that the gentleman had at the time a narrow escape\\nwith his life; the Badawin wished to put him to death as a spy, sent by\\nthe Frank to ensorceler their country, but the Shaykhs forbade\\nbloodshed, and merely deported the offender. Travellers caught\\nsketching are not often treated with such forbearance.\\n[FN#32] All Arabs assert that it pains the loaded camel\\'s feet to stand\\nstill, and, certainly, the \"fidgettiness\" of the animal to start, looks\\nas if he had some reason to prefer walking.\\n[FN#33] It often strains the camel to rise with a full Shugduf on his\\nback, besides which the motion is certain to destroy the vehicle in a\\nfew days. Those who are unable to climb up the camel\\'s neck usually\\ncarry with them a short ladder.\\n[FN#34] Wassit means, \"go in the middle of the road\"; Jannib, \"keep\\nclear of the sides.\" These words are fair specimens of how much may be\\nsaid by two Arabic syllables. Ya hu (O, he) is an address common in\\nArabia as in Egypt, and Y\\'al Jammal (O camel-man) is perhaps a little\\nmore civil.\\n[FN#35] The rivalry between the Sons of the two Holy Cities extends\\neven to these parts: the Madanis contending for Yambu\\', the Meccans for\\nJeddah.\\n</p>\\n<h2><span id=\"Chapter_XIII._FROM_YAMBU.27_TO_BIR_ABBAS.\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Chapter_XIII._FROM_YAMBU\\'_TO_BIR_ABBAS.\">Chapter XIII.

Our route lay over the plain between\\nthe mountains of Radhwah on the left, and the sea on the right hand;\\nthe land was desert,-that is to say, a hard level plain, strewed with\\nrounded lumps of granite and greenstone schist, with here and there a\\ndwarf Acacia, and a tuft of rank camel grass. By the light of a\\nglorious moon, nearly at the full, I was able to see the country\\ntolerably well.\\n</p><p>Our party consisted of twelve camels, and we travelled in Indian file,\\nhead tied to tail, with but one outrider, Omar Effendi, whose rank\\nrequired him to mount a dromedary with showy trappings. Immediately in\\nfront of me was Amm Jamal, whom I had to reprove for asking the boy\\nMohammed, \"Where have you picked up that Hindi, (Indian)?\" \"Are we, the\\nAfghans, the Indian-slayers,[FN#1] become Indians?\" I vociferated with\\nindignation, and brought the thing home to his feelings, by asking him\\nhow he, an Arab, would like to be called an Egyptian,-a Fellah? The\\nrest of the party was behind, sitting or dozing upon the rough\\nplatforms made by the lids of the two huge boxes slung to the sides of\\ntheir camels. Only one old woman, Al-Sitt Maryam (the lady Mary),\\nreturning\\n</p><p>[p.244] to Al-Madinah, her adopted country, after a visit to a sister\\nat Cairo, allowed herself the luxury of a half-dollar Shibriyah or cot,\\nfastened crosswise over the animal\\'s load. Moreover, all the party,\\nexcept Omar Effendi, in token of poverty, were dressed in the coarsest\\nand dirtiest of clothes,-the general suit consisting of a shirt torn in\\ndivers places and a bit of rag wrapped round the head. They carried\\nshort chibuks without mouth-pieces, and tobacco-pouches of greasy\\nleather. Though the country hereabouts is perfectly safe, all had their\\narms in readiness, and the unusual silence that succeeded to the\\nsinging, even Sa\\'ad the Demon held his tongue,-was sufficient to show\\nhow much they feared for their property. After a slow march of two\\nhours facing the moon, we turned somewhat towards the North-East, and\\nbegan to pass over undulating ground, in which a steady rise was\\nperceptible. We arrived at the halting-place at three in the morning,\\nafter a short march of about eight hours, during which we could not\\nhave passed over more than sixteen miles.[FN#2] The camels were\\nnakh\\'d[FN#3]; the boxes were taken off and piled together as a\\nprecaution against invisible robbers; my little tent, the only one in\\nthe party, was pitched; we then spread our rugs upon the ground and lay\\ndown to sleep.\\n</p><p>We arose at about 9 A.M. (July 19), and after congratulating one\\nanother upon being once more in the \"dear Desert,\" we proceeded in\\nexhilarated mood to light the fire for pipes and breakfast. The meal-a\\nbiscuit, a little rice, and a cup of milkless tea-was soon dispatched,\\nafter which I proceeded to inspect our position.\\n</p><p>[p.245]About a mile to the westward lay the little village\\nAl-Musahhal,[FN#4] a group of miserable mud hovels. On the south was a\\nstrip of bright blue sea, and all around, an iron plain producing\\nnaught but stones and grasshoppers, and bounded northward by a grisly\\nwall of blackish rock. Here and there a shrub fit only for fuel, or a\\ntuft of coarse grass, crisp with heat, met the eye. All was\\nsun-parched; the furious heat from above was drying up the sap and\\njuice of the land, as the simmering and quivering atmosphere showed;\\nmoreover the heavy dews of these regions, forming in large drops upon\\nthe plants and stones, concentrate the morning rays upon them like a\\nsystem of burning-glasses. After making these few observations I\\nfollowed the example of my companions, and returned to sleep.\\n</p><p>At two P.M. we were roused to a dinner as simple as the breakfast had\\nbeen. Boiled rice with an abundance of the clarified butter[FN#5] in\\nwhich Easterns delight, some fragments of Kahk[FN#6] or soft biscuit,\\nand stale bread[FN#7] and a handful of stoned and pressed date-paste,\\ncalled \\'Ajwah, formed the menu. Our potations began before dinner with\\na vile-tasted but wholesome drink called Akit,[FN#8]\\n</p><p>[p.246] dried sour milk dissolved in water; at the meal we drank the\\nleather-flavoured element, and ended with a large cupful of scalding\\ntea. Enormous quantities of liquid were consumed, for the sun seemed to\\nhave got into our throats, and the perspiration trickled as after a\\nshower of rain. Whilst we were eating, a Badawi woman passed close by\\nthe tent, leading a flock of sheep and goats, seeing which I expressed\\na desire to drink milk. My companions sent by one of the camel-men a\\nbit of bread, and asked in exchange for a cupful of \"laban.[FN#9]\" Thus\\nI learned that the Arabs, even in this corrupt region, still adhere to\\nthe meaningless custom of their ancestors, who chose to make the term\\n\"Labban[FN#10]\" (milk-seller) an opprobrium and a disgrace. Possibly\\nthe origin of the prejudice\\n</p><p>[p.247] might be the recognising of a traveller\\'s guest-right to call\\nfor milk gratis. However this may be, no one will in the present day\\nsell this article of consumption, even at civilised Meccah, except\\nEgyptians, a people supposed to be utterly without honour. As a general\\nrule in the Hijaz, milk abounds in the spring, but at all other times\\nof the year it is difficult to be procured. The Badawi woman managed,\\nhowever, to send me back a cupful.\\n</p><p>At three P.M. we were ready to start, and all saw, with unspeakable\\ngratification, a huge black nimbus rise from the shoulder of Mount\\nRadhwah, and range itself, like a good genius, between us and our\\nterrible foe, the sun. We hoped that it contained rain, but presently a\\nblast of hot wind, like the breath of a volcano, blew over the plain,\\nand the air was filled with particles of sand. This is the \"dry storm\"\\nof Arabia; it appears to depend upon some electrical phenomena which it\\nwould be desirable to investigate.[FN#11] When we had loaded and\\nmounted, my camel-men, two in number, came up to the Shugduf and\\ndemanded \"Bakhshish,\" which, it appears, they are now in the habit of\\ndoing each time the traveller starts. I was at first surprised to find\\nthe word here, but after a few days of Badawi society, my wonder\\ndiminished. The men were Beni-Harb of the great Hijazi tribe, which has\\nkept its blood pure for the last thirteen centuries,-how much more we\\nknow not,-but they had been corrupted by intercourse with pilgrims,\\nretaining none of their ancestral qualities but greed of gain,\\nrevengefulness, pugnacity, and a frantic kind of bravery, displayed on\\nrare occasions. Their nobility, however, did not prevent my quoting the\\nProphet\\'s saying, \"Of a truth, the worst names among the Arabs are the\\nBeni-Kalb\\n</p><p>[p.248] Kalb and the Beni-Harb,[FN#12]\" whilst I taunted them severely\\nwith their resemblance to the Fellahs of Egypt. They would have\\nresented this with asperity, had it proceeded from their own people,\\nbut the Turkish pilgrim-the character in which they knew me, despite my\\nArab dress-is a privileged person. The outer man of these Fight-Sons\\nwas contemptible; small chocolate-coloured beings, stunted and thin,\\nwith mops of course bushy hair burned brown by the sun, straggling\\nbeards, vicious eyes, frowning brows, screaming voices, and well-made,\\nbut attenuated, limbs. On their heads were Kufiyahs in the last stage\\nof wear: a tattered shirt, indigo-dyed, and girt with a bit of common\\nrope, composed their clothing; and their feet were protected from the\\nstones by soles of thick leather, kept in place by narrow thongs tied\\nto the ankle. Both were armed, one with a matchlock, and a\\nShintiyan[FN#13] in a leathern scabbard, slung over the shoulder, the\\nother with a Nabbut, and both showed at the waist the Arab\\'s invariable\\ncompanion, the Jambiyah (dagger). These ragged fellows, however, had\\ntheir pride. They would eat with me, and not disdain, like certain\\nself-styled Caballeros, to ask for more; but of work they would do\\nnone. No promise of \"Bakhshish,\" potent as\\n</p><p>[p.249] the spell of that word is, would induce them to assist in\\npitching my tent: they even expected Shaykh Nur to cook for them, and I\\nhad almost to use violence, for even the just excuse of a sore foot was\\ninsufficient to procure the privilege of mounting my Shugduf while the\\ncamel was sitting. It was, they said, the custom of the country from\\ntime immemorial to use a ladder when legs would not act. I agreed with\\nthem, but objected that I had no ladder. At last, wearied with their\\nthick-headedness, I snatched the nose-string of the camel, and by main\\nforce made it kneel.\\n</p><p>Our party was now strong enough. We had about 200 beasts carrying\\ngrain, attended by their proprietors, truculent looking as the\\ncontrabandistas of the Pyrenees. The escort was composed of seven\\nIrregular Turkish cavalry, tolerably mounted, and supplied each with an\\narmoury in epitome. They were privily derided by our party, who, being\\nArabs, had a sneaking fondness for the Badawin, however loth they might\\nbe to see them amongst the boxes.\\n</p><p>For three hours we travelled in a south-easterly direction upon a hard\\nplain and a sandy flat, on which several waters from the highlands find\\na passage to the sea westward. Gradually we were siding towards the\\nmountains, and at sunset I observed that we had sensibly neared them.\\nWe dismounted for a short halt; and, strangers being present, my\\ncompanions, before sitting down to smoke, said their prayers-a pious\\nexercise in which they did not engage for three days afterwards, when\\nthey met certain acquaintances at Al-Hamra. As evening came on, we\\nemerged from a scrub of Acacia and Tamarisk and turned due East,\\ntraversing an open country with a perceptible rise. Scarcely was it\\ndark before the cry of \"Harami\" (thieves) rose loud in the rear,\\ncausing such confusion as one may see in a boat in the Bay of Naples\\nwhen suddenly neared by a water-spout\\n</p><p>[p.250] All the camel-men brandished their huge staves, and rushed back\\nvociferating in the direction of the robbers. They were followed by the\\nhorsemen; and truly, had the thieves possessed the usual acuteness of\\nthe profession, they might have driven off the camels in our van with\\nsafety and convenience.[FN#14] But these contemptible beings were only\\nhalf a dozen in number, and they had lighted their matchlocks, which\\ndrew a bullet or two in their direction. Whereupon they ran away. This\\nincident aroused no inconsiderable excitement, for it seemed ominous of\\nworse things about to happen to us when entangled in the hills, and the\\nfaces of my companions, perfect barometers of fair and foul tidings,\\nfell to zero. For nine hours we journeyed through a brilliant\\nmoonlight, and as the first grey streak appeared in the Eastern sky we\\nentered a scanty \"Misyal,[FN#15]\" or Fiumara, strewed with pebbles and\\nrounded stones, about half a mile in breadth, and flanked by almost\\nperpendicular hills of primitive formation. I began by asking the names\\nof peaks and other remarkable spots, when I found that a folio volume\\nwould not contain a three months\\' collection[FN#16]: every hill and\\ndale, flat, valley, and\\n</p><p>[p.251] water-course here has its proper name or rather names. The\\ningenuity shown by the Badawin in distinguishing between localities the\\nmost similar, is the result of a high organization of the perceptive\\nfaculties, perfected by the practice of observing a recurrence of\\nlandscape features few in number and varying but little amongst\\nthemselves. After travelling two hours up this torrent bed, winding in\\nan Easterly direction, and crossing some \"Harrah,\" or ridges of rock,\\n\"Ria,\" steep descents,[FN#17] \"Kitaah,\" patch of stony flat, and bits\\nof \"Sahil,\" dwarf plain, we found ourselves about eight A.M., after a\\nmarch of about thirty-four miles, at Bir Sa\\'id (Sa\\'id\\'s Well), our\\ndestination.\\n</p><p>I had been led to expect at the \"Well,\" a pastoral scene, wild flowers,\\nflocks and flowing waters; so I looked with a jaundiced eye upon a deep\\nhole full of slightly brackish water dug in a tamped hollow-a kind of\\npunch-bowl with granite walls, upon whose grim surface a few thorns of\\nexceeding hardihood braved the sun for a season. Not a house was in\\nsight-it was as barren and desolate a spot as the sun ever \"viewed in\\nhis wide career.\" But this is what the Arabian traveller must expect.\\nHe is to traverse, for instance, the Wady Al-Ward-the Vale of Flowers.\\nHe indulges in sweet recollections of Indian lakes beautiful with the\\nLotus, and Persian plains upon which Narcissus is the meanest of\\ngrasses. He sees a plain like swish-work, where knobs of granite act\\ndaisies; and where, at every fifty yards, some hapless bud or blossom\\nis dying of inanition among the stones.\\n</p><p>The sun scorched our feet as we planted the tent, and, after drinking\\nour breakfast, we passed the usual day of perspiration and\\nsemi-lethargy. In discomfort man naturally\\n</p><p>[p.252] hails a change, even though it be one from bad to worse. When\\nour enemy began slanting towards the West, we felt ready enough to\\nproceed on our journey. The camels were laden shortly after 3 P.M.,\\nJuly 20th, and we started, with water jars in our hands, through a\\nstorm of Samun.\\n</p><p>We travelled five hours in a North-Easterly course up a diagonal\\nvalley,[FN#18] through a country fantastic in its desolation-a mass of\\nhuge hills, barren plains, and desert vales. Even the sturdy Acacias\\nhere failed, and in some places the camel grass could not find earth\\nenough for its root. The road wound among mountains, rocks and hills of\\ngranite, and over broken ground, flanked by huge blocks and boulders\\npiled up as if man\\'s art had aided Nature to disfigure herself. Vast\\nclefts seamed like scars the hideous face of earth; here they widened\\ninto dark caves, there they were choked with glistening drift sand. Not\\na bird or a beast was to be seen or heard; their presence would have\\nargued the vicinity of water; and, though my companions opined that\\nBadawin were lurking among the rocks, I decided that these Badawin were\\nthe creatures of their fears. Above, a sky like polished blue steel,\\nwith a tremendous blaze of yellow light, glared upon us without the\\nthinnest veil of mist cloud. Below, the brass-coloured circle scorched\\nthe face and dazzled the eyes, mocking them the while with offers of\\nwater that was but air. The distant prospect was more attractive than\\nthe near view, because it borrowed a bright azure tinge from the\\nintervening atmosphere; but the jagged peaks and the perpendicular\\nstreaks of shadow down the flanks of the mountainous background\\n</p><p>[p.253] showed that yet in store for us was no change for the better.\\n</p><p>Between 10 and 11 P.M., we reached human habitations-a phenomenon\\nunseen since we left Al-Musahhal-in the shape of a long straggling\\nvillage. It is called Al-Hamra, from the redness of the sands near\\nwhich it is built, or Al-Wasitah, the \"half-way,\" because it is the\\nmiddle station between Yambu\\' and Al-Madinah. It is therefore\\nconsiderably out of place in Burckhardt\\'s map; and those who copy from\\nhim make it much nearer the sea-port than it really is. We wandered\\nnearly an hour in search of an encamping station, for the surly\\nvillagers ordered us off every flatter bit of ground, without, however,\\ndeigning to show us where our jaded beasts might rest. At last, after\\nlong wrangling, we found the usual spot; the camels were unloaded, the\\nboxes and baggage were disposed in a circle for greater security\\nagainst the petty pilferers in which this part of the road abounds, and\\nmy companions spread their rugs so as to sleep upon their valuables. I\\nwas invited to follow the general example; but I absolutely declined\\nthe vicinity of so many steaming and snoring fellow-travellers. Some\\nwonder was excited by the Afghan Haji\\'s obstinacy and recklessness; but\\nresistance to these people is sometimes bien place, and a man from\\nKabul is allowed to say and to do strange things. In answer to their\\nwarnings of nightly peril, I placed a drawn sword by my side[FN#19] and\\na cocked pistol under my pillow, the saddle-bag: a carpet spread upon\\nthe cool loose sand formed by no means an uncomfortable couch, and upon\\nit I enjoyed a sound sleep till day-break.\\n</p><p>Rising at dawn (July 21), I proceeded to visit the village. It is built\\nupon a narrow shelf at the top of a precipitous hill to the North, and\\non the South runs a sandy\\n</p><p>[p.254] Fiumara about half a mile broad. On all sides are rocks and\\nmountains rough and stony; so you find yourself in another of those\\npunch-bowls which the Arabs seem to consider choice sites for\\nsettlements.[FN#20] The Fiumara, hereabouts very winding, threads the\\nhigh grounds all the way down from the plateau of Al-Madinah: during\\nthe rainy season it becomes a raging torrent, carrying westwards to the\\nRed Sea the drainage of a hundred hills. Water of good quality is\\nreadily found in it by digging a few feet below the surface at the\\nangles where the stream forms the deepest hollows, and in some places\\nthe stony sides give out bubbling springs.[FN#21]\\n</p><p>Al-Hamra itself is a collection of stunted houses or rather hovels,\\nmade of unbaked brick and mud, roofed over with palm leaves, and\\npierced with air-holes, which occasionally boast a bit of plank for a\\nshutter. It appears thickly populated in the parts where the walls are\\nstanding, but, like all settlements in the Holy Land, Al-Hijaz,[FN#23]\\nit abounds in ruins. It is well supplied with provisions, which are\\nhere cheaper than at Al-Madinah,-a circumstance that induced Sa\\'ad the\\nDemon to overload his hapless camel with a sack of wheat. In the\\nvillage are a few shops where grain, huge plantains, ready-made bread,\\nrice,\\n</p><p>[p.255] clarified butter, and other edibles are to be purchased. Palm\\norchards of considerable extent supply it with dates. The bazar is,\\nlike the generality of such places in the villages of Eastern Arabia, a\\nlong lane, here covered with matting, there open to the sun, and the\\nnarrow streets-if they may be so called-are full of dust and glare.\\nNear the encamping ground of caravans is a fort for the officer\\ncommanding a troop of Albanian cavalry, whose duty it is to defend the\\nvillage,[FN#24] to hold the country, and to escort merchant travellers.\\nThe building consists of an outer wall of hewn stone, loopholed for\\nmusketry, and surmounted by \"Shararif,\" \"remparts coquets,\" about as\\nuseful against artillery as the sugar gallery round a Twelfth-cake.\\nNothing would be easier than to take the place: a false attack would\\ndraw off the attention of the defenders, who in these latitudes know\\nnothing of sentry-duty, whilst scaling-ladders or a bag full of powder\\nwould command a ready entrance into the other side. Around the Al-Hamra\\nfort are clusters of palm-leaf huts, where the soldiery lounge and\\nsmoke, and near it is the usual coffee-house, a shed kept by an\\nAlbanian. These places are frequented probably on account of the\\nintense heat inside the fort. We passed a comfortless day at the \"Red\\nVillage.\" Large flocks of sheep and goats were being driven in and out\\nof the place, but their surly shepherds would give no milk, even in\\nexchange for bread and meat. The morning was spent in watching certain\\nBadawin, who, matchlock in hand, had climbed the hills in pursuit of a\\ntroop of cranes: not one bird was hit of the many fired at-a\\ncircumstance which did not say much for their vaunted marksmanship.\\nBefore breakfast I bought a moderately sized sheep for a dollar.\\n</p><p>[p.256] Shaykh Hamid \"halaled[FN#25]\" (butchered) it, according to\\nrule, and my companions soon prepared a feast of boiled mutton. But\\nthat sheep proved a \"bone of contention.\" The boy Mohammed had, in a\\nfit of economy, sold its head to a Badawi for three piastres, and the\\nothers, disappointed in their anticipations of \"haggis,\" lost temper.\\nWith the \"Demon\\'s\" voluble tongue and impudent countenance in the van,\\nthey opened such a volley of raillery and sarcasm upon the young\\n\"tripe-seller,\" that he in his turn became excited-furious. I had some\\ndifficulty to keep the peace, for it did not suit my interests that\\nthey should quarrel. But to do the Arabs justice, nothing is easier for\\na man who knows them than to work upon their good feelings. \"He is a\\nstranger in your country-a guest!\" acted as a charm; they listened\\npatiently to Mohammed\\'s gross abuse, only promising to answer him when\\nin his land, that is to say, near Meccah. But what especially soured\\nour day was the report that Sa\\'ad, the great robber-chief, and his\\nbrother were in the field; consequently that our march would be delayed\\nfor some time: every half-hour some fresh tattle from the camp or the\\ncoffee-house added fuel to the fire of our impatience.\\n</p><p>A few particulars about this Schinderhans of Al-Hijaz[FN#26] may not be\\nunacceptable. He is the chief of the Sumaydah and the Mahamid, two\\ninfluential sub-families of the Hamidah, the principal family of the\\nBeni-Harb tribe of Badawin. He therefore aspired to rule all the\\nHamidah, and through them the Beni-Harb, in which case he would have\\nbeen, de facto, monarch of the Holy Land. But the Sharif of Meccah, and\\nAhmad Pasha,\\n</p><p>[p.257] the Turkish governor of the chief city, for some political\\nreason degraded him, and raised up a rival in the person of Shaykh\\nFahd, another ruffian of a similar stamp, who calls himself chief of\\nthe Beni-Amr, the third sub-family of the Hamidah family. Hence all\\nkinds of confusion. Sa\\'ad\\'s people, who number it is said 5000, resent,\\nwith Arab asperity, the insult offered to their chief, and beat Fahd\\'s,\\nwho do not amount to 800. Fahd, supported by the government, cuts off\\nSa\\'ad\\'s supplies. Both are equally wild and reckless, and-nowhere doth\\nthe glorious goddess, Liberty, show a more brazen face than in this\\nEastern\\n</p><p>\"Inviolate land of the brave and the free;\"\\n</p><p>both seize the opportunity of shooting troopers, of plundering\\ntravellers, and of closing the roads. This state of things continued\\ntill I left the Hijaz, when the Sharif of Meccah proposed, it was said,\\nto take the field in person against the arch-robber. And, as will\\nafterwards be seen in these pages, Sa\\'ad, had the audacity to turn back\\nthe Sultan\\'s Mahmil or litter-the ensign of Imperial power-and to shut\\nthe road against its cortege, because the Pashas of Al-Madinah and of\\nthe Damascus caravan would not guarantee his restitution to his former\\ndignity. That such vermin is allowed to exist proves the imbecility of\\nthe Turkish government. The Sultan pays pensions in corn and cloth to\\nthe very chiefs who arm their varlets against him; and the Pashas,\\nafter purloining all they can, hand over to their enemies the means of\\nresistance. It is more than probable, that Abd al-Majid has never heard\\na word of truth concerning Al-Hijaz, and that fulsome courtiers\\npersuade him that men there tremble at his name. His government,\\nhowever, is desirous, if report speaks truth, of thrusting Al-Hijaz\\nupon the Egyptian, who on his side would willingly pay a large sum to\\navert such calamity. The Holy Land drains off Turkish gold and blood in\\nabundance, and the\\n</p><p>[p.258] lords of the country hold in it a contemptible position. If\\nthey catch a thief, they dare not hang him. They must pay black-mail,\\nand yet be shot at in every pass. They affect superiority over the\\nArabs, hate them, and are despised by them. Such in Al-Hijaz are the\\neffects of the charter of Gulkhanah, a panacea, like Holloway\\'s Pills,\\nfor all the evils to which Turkish, Arab, Syrian, Greek, Egyptian,\\nPersian, Armenian, Kurd, and Albanian flesh is heir to. Such the\\nresults of the Tanzimat, the silliest copy of Europe\\'s\\nfolly-bureaucracy and centralisation-that the pen of empirical\\nstatecraft ever traced.[FN#27] Under a strong-handed and strong-hearted\\ndespotism, like Mohammed Ali\\'s, Al-Hijaz, in one generation, might be\\npurged of its pests. By a proper use of the blood feud; by vigorously\\nsupporting the weaker against the stronger classes; by regularly\\ndefeating every Badawi who earns a name for himself; and, above all, by\\nthe exercise of unsparing, unflinching justice,[FN#28] the few\\nthousands of half-naked bandits, who now make the land a fighting\\nfield, would soon sink into utter insignificance.\\n</p><p>[p.259] But to effect such end, the Turks require the old stratocracy,\\nwhich, bloody as it was, worked with far less misery than the charter\\nand the new code. What Milton calls\\n</p><p>\"The solid rule of civil government\"\\n</p><p>has done wonders for the race that nurtured and brought to perfection\\nan idea spontaneous to their organisation. The world has yet to learn\\nthat the admirable exotic will thrive amongst the country gentlemen of\\nMonomotapa or the ragged nobility of Al-Hijaz.[FN#29] And it requires\\nno prophetic eye to foresee the day when the Wahhabis or the Badawin,\\nrising en masse, will rid the land of its feeble conquerors.[FN#30]\\n</p><p>Sa\\'ad, the Old Man of the Mountains, was described to me as a little\\nbrown Badawi; contemptible in appearance, but remarkable for courage\\nand ready wit. He has for treachery a keen scent, which he requires to\\nkeep in exercise. A blood feud with Abd al-Muttalib, the present Sharif\\nof Meccah, who slew his nephew, and the hostility of several Sultans,\\nhas rendered his life eventful. He lost all his teeth by poison, which\\nwould have killed him, had he not, after swallowing the potion,\\ncorrected it by drinking off a large potfull of clarified butter. Since\\nthat time he has lived entirely upon fruits, which he gathers for\\nhimself, and\\n</p><p>[p.260] coffee which he prepares with his own hands. In Sultan Mahmud\\'s\\ntime he received from Constantinople a gorgeous purse, which he was\\ntold to open, as it contained something for his private inspection.\\nSuspecting treachery, he gave it for this purpose to a slave, bidding\\nhim carry it to some distance; the bearer was shot by a pistol\\ncunningly fixed, like Rob Roy\\'s, in the folds of the bag. Whether this\\nfar-known story be \"true or only well found,\" it is certain that Shaykh\\nSa\\'ad now fears the Turks, even \"when they bring gifts.\" The Sultan\\nsends, or is supposed to send him, presents of fine horses, robes of\\nhonour, and a large quantity of grain. But the Shaykh, trusting to his\\nhills rather than to steeds, sells them; he gives away the dresses to\\nhis slaves, and he distributes the grain amongst his clansmen. Of his\\ncharacter, men, as usual, tell two tales: some praise his charity, and\\ncall him the friend of the poor, as certainly as he is a foe to the\\nrich. Others, on the contrary, describe him as cruel, cold-blooded, and\\nnotably, even among Arabs, revengeful and avaricious. The truth\\nprobably lies between these two extremes, but I observed that those of\\nmy companions who spoke most highly of the robber chief when at a\\ndistance seemed to be in the sudori freddi whilst under the shadow of\\nhis hills.\\n</p><p>Al-Hamra is the third station from Al-Madinah in the Darb Sultani, the\\n\"Sultan\\'s\" or \"High Road,\" the Westerly line leading to Meccah along\\nthe sea-coast. When the robbers permit, the pilgrims prefer this route\\non account of its superior climate, the facility of procuring water and\\nsupplies, the vicinity of the sea, and the circumstance of its passing\\nthrough \"Badr,\" the scene of the Prophet\\'s principal military exploits\\n(A.H. 2). After mid-day, on the 21st July, when we had made up our\\nminds that Fate had determined we should halt at Al-Hamra, a caravan\\narrived from Meccah; and the new travellers had interest to procure an\\nescort, and permission\\n</p><p>[p.261] to proceed without delay towards Al-Madinah. The good news\\nfilled us with joy. A little after four P.M. we urged our panting\\ncamels over the fiery sands to join the Meccans, who were standing\\nready for the march, on the other side of the torrent bed. An hour\\nafterwards we started in an Easterly direction.\\n</p><p>My companions having found friends and relations in the Meccan\\ncaravan,-the boy Mohammed\\'s elder brother, about whom more anon, was of\\nthe number,-were full of news and excitement. At sunset they prayed\\nwith unction: even Sa\\'ad and Hamid had not the face to sit their camels\\nduring the halt, when all around were washing, sanding\\nthemselves,[FN#31] and busy with their devotions. We then ate our\\nsuppers, remounted, and started once more. Shortly after night set in,\\nwe came to a sudden halt. A dozen different reports rose to account for\\nthis circumstance, which was occasioned by a band of Badawin, who had\\nmanned a gorge, and sent forward a \"parliamentary,\" ordering us\\nforthwith to stop. They at first demanded money to let us pass; but at\\nlast, hearing that we were Sons of the Holy Cities, they granted us\\ntransit on the sole condition that the military,-whom they, like Irish\\npeasants, hate and fear,-should return to whence they came. Upon this,\\nour escort, 200 men, wheeled their horses round and galloped back to\\ntheir barracks. We moved onwards, without, however, seeing any robbers;\\nmy camel-man pointed out their haunts, and showed me a small bird\\nhovering over a place where he supposed water trickled from the rock.\\nThe fellow had attempted a sneer at my expense when the fray was\\nimpending. \"Why don\\'t you load your pistols, Effendi,\"\\n</p><p>[p.262] he cried, \"and get out of your litter, and show fight?\"\\n\"Because,\" I replied as loudly, \"in my country, when dogs run at us, we\\nthrash them with sticks.\" This stopped Mansur\\'s mouth for a time, but\\nhe and I were never friends. Like the lowest orders of Orientals, he\\nrequired to be ill-treated; gentleness and condescension he seemed to\\nconsider a proof of cowardice or of imbecility. I began with kindness,\\nbut was soon compelled to use hard words at first, and then threats,\\nwhich, though he heard them with frowns and mutterings, produced\\nmanifest symptoms of improvement.\\n</p><p>\"Oignez vilain, il vous poindra!\\nPoignez vilain, il vous oindra!\"\\n</p><p>says the old French proverb, and the axiom is more valuable in the East\\neven than in the West.\\n</p><p>Our night\\'s journey had no other incident. We travelled over rising\\nground with the moon full in our faces; and, about midnight, we passed\\nthrough another long straggling line of villages, called\\nJadaydah,[FN#32] or Al-Khayf.[FN#33] The principal part of it lies on\\nthe left of the road going to Al-Madinah; it has a fort like that of\\nAl-Hamra, springs of tolerable drinking water, a Nakhil or date-ground,\\nand a celebrated (dead) saint, Abd al-Rahim al-Burai. A little beyond\\nit lies the Bughaz[FN#34] or defile, where in A.D. 1811 Tussun Bey and\\nhis 8000 Turks were totally defeated by 25,000 Harbi Badawin and\\nWahhabis.[FN#35]\\n</p><p>[p.263] This is a famous attacking-point of the Beni-Harb. In former\\ntimes both Jazzar Pasha, the celebrated \"butcher\" of Syria, and\\nAbdullah Pasha of Damascus, were baffled at the gorge of\\nJadaydah[FN#36]; and this year the commander of the Syrian caravan,\\nafraid of risking an attack at a place so ill-omened, avoided it by\\nmarching upon Meccah via the Desert road of Nijd. At four A.M., having\\ntravelled about twenty-four miles due East, we encamped at Bir Abbas.\\n</p><p>[FN#1] Alluding to the celebrated mountain, the \"Hindu-kush,\" whence\\nthe Afghans sallied forth to lay waste India.\\n[FN#2] Throughout this work I have estimated the pace of a Hijazi\\ncamel, laden and walking in caravan line, under ordinary circumstances,\\nat two geographical miles an hour. A sandy plain or a rocky pass might\\nmake a difference of half a mile each way, but not more.\\n[FN#3] See Chap. VIII., page 152, note 1, ante.\\n[FN#4] The reader must be warned that these little villages in Arabia,\\nas in Sind and Baluchistan, are continually changing their names,\\nwhilst the larger settlements always retain the same. The traveller,\\ntoo, must beware of writing down the first answer he receives; in one\\nof our maps a village on the Euphrates is gravely named \"M\\'adri,\"\\n(\"Don\\'t know\").\\n[FN#5] Here called Samn, the Indian ghee.\\n[FN#6] The \"Kahk\" in this country is a light and pleasant bread made of\\nground wheat, kneaded with milk, leavened with sour bean flour, and\\nfinally baked in an oven, not, as usual, in the East, upon an iron\\nplate. The Kahk of Egypt is a kind of cake.\\n[FN#7] Stale unleavened bread is much relished by Easterns, who say\\nthat keeping it on journeys makes it sweet. To prevent its becoming\\nmouldy, they cut it up into little bits, and, at the risk of hardening\\nit to the consistence of wood, they dry it by exposure to the air.\\n[FN#8] This Akit has different names in all parts of Arabia; even in\\nAl-Hijaz it is known by the name of Mazir, as well as, \"Igt,\" (the\\ncorruption of Akit). When very sour, it is called \"Saribah,\" and when\\ndried, without boiling, \"Jamidah.\" The Arabs make it by evaporating the\\nserous part of the milk; the remainder is then formed into cakes or\\nlumps with the hand, and spread upon hair cloth to dry. They eat it\\nwith clarified butter, and drink it melted in water. It is considered a\\ncooling and refreshing beverage, but boasts few attractions to the\\nstranger. The Baluchis and wild tribes of Sindians call this\\npreparation of milk \"Krut,\" and make it in the same way as the Badawin\\ndo.\\n[FN#9] In Arabic and Hebrew, milk; the Maltese give the word a very\\ndifferent signification, and the Egyptians, like the Syrians, confine\\ntheir use of it to sour milk or curds-calling sweet milk \"laban halib,\"\\nor simply \"halib.\"\\n[FN#10] In a previous work (History of Sind), I have remarked that\\nthere exists some curious similarity in language and customs between\\nthe Arabs and the various races occupying the broad ranges of hills\\nthat separate India from Persia. Amongst these must be numbered the\\nprejudice alluded to above. The lamented Dr. Stocks, of Bombay, who\\ntravelled amongst and observed the Brahui and the Baluchi nomads in the\\nPashin valley, informed me that, though they will give milk in exchange\\nfor other commodities, yet they consider it a disgrace to make money by\\nit. This, methinks, is too conventional a point of honour to have\\nsprung up spontaneously in two countries so distant, and apparently so\\nunconnected.\\n[FN#11] At Aden, as well as in Sind, these dry storms abound, and there\\nthe work of meteorological investigation would be easier than in\\nAl-Hijaz.\\n[FN#12] \"Beni-Kalb,\" (or Juhaynah, Chap. X.), would mean the\\n\"Dogs\\'-Sons\"-\"Beni-Harb,\" the \"Sons of Fight.\"\\n[FN#13] The Shintiyan is the common sword-blade of the Badawin; in\\nWestern Arabia, it is called Majar (from the Magyars?), and is said to\\nbe of German manufacture. Good old weapons of the proper curve, marked\\nlike Andrew Ferraras with a certain number of lines down their length,\\nwill fetch, even in Arabia, from L7 to L8. The modern and cheap ones\\ncost about 10s. Excellent weapons abound in this country, the reason\\nbeing that there is a perpetual demand for them, and when once\\npurchased, they become heir-looms in the family. I have heard that when\\nthe Beni Bu Ali tribe, near Ras al-Khaymah, was defeated with slaughter\\nby Sir Lionel Smith\\'s expedition, the victors found many valuable old\\nEuropean blades in the hands of the slain.\\n[FN#14] The way of carrying off a camel in this country is to loosen\\nhim, and then to hang on heavily to his tail, which causes him to start\\nat full gallop.\\n[FN#15] The Arabic Misyal, Masyal, Masil, or Masilah, is the Indian\\nNullah and the Sicilian \"Fiumara,\" a hill water-course, which rolls a\\ntorrent during and after rain, and is either partially or wholly dry at\\nother seasons,-the stream flowing slowly underground. In England we\\nwant the feature, and therefore there is no single word to express it.\\nOur \"River\" is an imperfect way of conveying the idea.\\n[FN#16] Generalisation is not the forte of the Arabic language.\\n\"Al-Kulzum\" (the Red Sea), for instance, will be unintelligible to the\\nnative of Jeddah; call it the Sea of Jeddah, and you at once explain\\nyourself; so the Badawin will have names for each separate part, but no\\nsingle one to express the whole. This might be explained by their\\nignorance of anything but details. The same thing is observable,\\nhowever, in the writings of the Arabian geographers when they come to\\ntreat of the objects near home.\\n</p><p>[FN#17] About the classic \"Harrah,\" I shall have more to say at a\\nfuture time. The word \"Ria\" in literary and in vulgar Arabic is almost\\nsynonymous with Akabah, a steep descent, a path between hills or a\\nmountain road.\\n[FN#18] Valleys may be divided into three kinds. 1. Longitudinal, i.e.\\nparallel to the axis of their ridges; 2. Transversal or perpendicular\\nto the same; and, 3. Diagonal, which form an acute or an obtuse angle\\nwith the main chain of mountains.\\n[FN#19] This act, by the bye, I afterwards learned to be a greater act\\nof imprudence than the sleeping alone. Nothing renders the Arab thief\\nso active as the chance of stealing a good weapon.\\n[FN#20] Probably, because water is usually found in such places. In the\\nwild parts of the country, wells are generally protected by some\\nfortified building, for men consider themselves safe from an enemy\\nuntil their supply of water is cut off.\\n[FN#22] Near Al-Hamra, at the base of the Southern hills, within fire\\nof the forts, there is a fine spring of sweet water. All such fountains\\nare much prized by the people, who call them \"Rock-water,\" and\\nattribute to them tonic and digestive virtues.\\n[FN#23] As far as I could discover, the reason of the ruinous state of\\nthe country at present is the effect of the old Wahhabi and Egyptian\\nwars in the early part of the present century, and the misrule of the\\nTurks. In Arabia the depopulation of a village or a district is not to\\nbe remedied, as in other countries, by an influx of strangers; the land\\nstill belongs to the survivors of the tribe, and trespass would be\\nvisited with a bloody revenge.\\n[FN#24] Without these forts the Turks, at least so said my companions,\\ncould never hold the country against the Badawin. There is a little\\namour propre in the assertion, but upon the whole it is true. There are\\nno Mohammed Alis, Jazzars, and Ibrahim Pachas in these days.\\n[FN#25] To \"halal\" is to kill an animal according to Moslem rites: a\\nword is wanted to express the act, and we cannot do better than to\\nborrow it from the people to whom the practice belongs.\\n[FN#26] He is now dead, and has been succeeded by a son worse than\\nhimself.\\n[FN#27] The greatest of all its errors was that of appointing to the\\nprovinces, instead of the single Pasha of the olden time, three\\ndifferent governors, civil, military, and fiscal, all depending upon\\nthe supreme council at Constantinople. Thus each province has three\\nplunderers instead of one, and its affairs are referred to a body that\\ncan take no interest in it.\\n[FN#28] Ziyad bin Abihi was sent by Al-Mu\\'awiyah, the Caliph, to reform\\nAl-Basrah, a den of thieves; he made a speech, noticed that he meant to\\nrule with the sword, and advised all offenders to leave the city. The\\ninhabitants were forbidden under pain of death to appear in the streets\\nafter evening prayers, and dispositions were made to secure the\\nexecution of the penalty. Two hundred persons were put to death by the\\npatrol during the first night, only five during the second, and not a\\ndrop of blood was shed afterwards.

FROM BIR ABBAS TO AL-MADINAH.\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\\n<p>THE 22nd July was a grand trial of temper to our little party. The\\nposition of Bir Abbas exactly resembles that of Al-Hamra, except that\\nthe bulge of the hill-girt Fiumara is at this place about two miles\\nwide. There are the usual stone-forts and palm-leaved hovels for the\\ntroopers, stationed here to hold the place and to escort travellers,\\nwith a coffee-shed, and a hut or two, called a bazar, but no village.\\nOur encamping ground was a bed of loose sand, with which the violent\\nSamum filled the air; not a tree or a bush was in sight; a species of\\nhardy locust and swarms of flies were the only remnants of animal life:\\nthe scene was a caricature of Sind. Although we were now some hundred\\nfeet, to judge by the water-shed, above the level of the sea, the\\nmid-day sun scorched even through the tent; our frail tenement was more\\nthan once blown down, and the heat of the sand made the work of\\nrepitching it painful. Again my companions, after breakfasting, hurried\\nto the coffee-house, and returned one after the other with dispiriting\\nreports. Then they either quarrelled desperately about nothing, or they\\nthrew themselves on their rugs, pretending to sleep in very sulkiness.\\nThe lady Maryam soundly rated her surly son for refusing to fill her\\nchibuk for the twelfth time that morning, with the usual religious\\nphrases, \"Allah direct thee into the right way, O my son!\"-meaning that\\nhe was going to the bad, and \"O my calamity, thy mother is a lone\\nwoman, O Allah!\"-equivalent to the\\n</p><p>[p.265] European parental plaint about grey hairs being brought down in\\nsorrow to the grave. Before noon a small caravan which followed us came\\nin with two dead bodies,-a trooper shot by the Badawin, and an Albanian\\nkilled by sun-stroke, or the fiery wind.[FN#1] Shortly after mid-day a\\nCaravan, travelling in an opposite direction, passed by us; it was\\ncomposed chiefly of Indian pilgrims, habited in correct costume, and\\nhurrying towards Meccah in hot haste. They had been allowed to pass\\nunmolested, because probably a pound sterling could not have been\\ncollected from a hundred pockets, and Sa\\'ad the Robber sometimes does a\\ncheap good deed. But our party,\\n</p><p>[p.266] having valuables with them, did not seem to gather heart from\\nthis event. In the evening we all went out to see some Arab Shaykhs who\\nwere travelling to Bir Abbas in order to receive their salaries.\\nWithout such douceurs, it is popularly said and believed, no stone\\nwalls could enable a Turk to hold Al-Hijaz against the hill-men. Such\\nwas our system in Afghanistan-most unwise, teaching in limine the\\nsubject to despise rulers subject to blackmail. Besides which, these\\nhighly paid Shaykhs do no good. When a fight takes place or a road is\\nshut, they profess inability to restrain their clansmen; and the richer\\nthey are, of course the more formidable they become. The party looked\\nwell; they were Harb, dignified old men in the picturesque Arab\\ncostume, with erect forms, fierce thin features, and white beards, well\\narmed, and mounted upon high-bred and handsomely equipped dromedaries\\nfrom Al-Shark.[FN#2] Preceded by their half-naked clansmen, carrying\\nspears twelve or thirteen feet long, garnished with single or double\\ntufts of black ostrich feathers, and ponderous matchlocks, which were\\ndischarged on approaching the fort, they were not without a kind of\\nbarbaric pomp.\\n</p><p>Immediately after the reception of these Shaykhs, there was a parade of\\nthe Arnaut Irregular horse. About 500 of them rode out to the sound of\\nthe Nakus or little kettle-drum, whose puny notes strikingly contrasted\\nwith this really martial sight. The men, it is true, were mounted on\\nlean Arab and Egyptian nags, ragged-looking as their clothes; and each\\ntrooper was armed\\n</p><p>[p.267] in his own way, though all had swords, pistols and matchlocks,\\nor firelocks of some kind. But they rode hard as Galway \"buckeens,\" and\\nthere was a gallant reckless look about the fellows which prepossessed\\nme strongly in their favour. Their animals, too, though notable\\n\"screws,\" were well trained, and their accoutrements were intended for\\nuse, not show. I watched their manoeuvres with curiosity. They left\\ntheir cantonments one by one, and, at the sound of the tom-tom, by\\ndegrees formed a \"plump\" or \"herse\"-column[FN#3] it could not be\\ncalled-all huddled together in confusion. Presently the little\\nkettle-drum changed its note and the parade its aspect. All the serried\\nbody dispersed as would Light Infantry, now continuing their advance,\\nthen hanging back, then making a rush, and all the time keeping up a\\nhot fire upon the enemy. At another signal they suddenly put their\\nhorses to full speed, and, closing upon the centre, again advanced in a\\ndense mass. After three-quarters of an hour parading, sometimes\\ncharging singly, often in bodies, to the right, to the left, and\\nstraight in front, halting when requisite, and occasionally retreating,\\nParthian-like, the Arnauts turned en masse towards their lines. As they\\nneared them, all broke off and galloped in, ventre a terre, discharging\\ntheir shotted guns with much recklessness against objects assumed to\\ndenote the enemy. But ball-cartridge seemed to be plentiful hereabouts;\\nduring the whole of this and the next day, I remarked that bullets,\\nnotched for noise, were fired away in mere fun.[FN#4]\\n</p><p>[p.268] Barbarous as these movements may appear to the Cavalry Martinet\\nof the \"good old school,\" yet to something of the kind will the tactics\\nof that arm of the service, I humbly opine, return, when the perfect\\nuse of the rifle, the revolver, and field artillery shall have made the\\npresent necessarily slow system fatal. Also, if we adopt the common\\nsense opinion of a modern writer,[FN#5] and determine that \"individual\\nprowess, skill in single combats, good horsemanship, and sharp swords\\nrender cavalry formidable,\" these semi-barbarians are wiser in their\\ngeneration than the civilised, who never practise arms (properly so\\ncalled), whose riding-drill never made a good rider, whose horses are\\nover-weighted, and whose swords are worthless. They have yet another\\npoint of superiority over us; they cultivate the individuality of the\\nsoldier, whilst we strive to make him a mere automaton. In the days of\\nEuropean chivalry, battles were a system of well-fought duels. This was\\nsucceeded by the age of discipline, when, to use the language of\\nRabelais, \"men seemed rather a consort of organ-pipes, or mutual\\nconcord of the wheels of a clock, than an infantry and cavalry, or army\\nof soldiers.\" Our aim should now be to combine the merits of both\\nsystems; to make men individually\\n</p><p>[p.269] excellent in the use of weapons, and still train them to act\\nnaturally and habitually in concert. The French have given a model to\\nEurope in the Chasseurs de Vincennes,-a body capable of most perfect\\ncombination, yet never more truly excellent than when each man is\\nfighting alone. We, I suppose, shall imitate them at some future\\ntime.[FN#6]\\n</p><p>A distant dropping of fire-arms ushered in the evening of our first\\nmelancholy day at Bir Abbas. This, said my companions, was a sign that\\nthe troops and the hill-men were fighting. They communicated the\\nintelligence, as if it ought to be an effectual check upon my\\nimpatience to proceed; it acted, however, in the contrary way. I\\nsupposed that the Badawin, after battling out the night, would be less\\nwarlike the next day; the others, however, by no means agreed in\\nopinion with me. At Yambu\\' the whole party had boasted loudly that the\\npeople of Al-Madinah could keep their Badawin in order, and had twitted\\nthe boy Mohammed with their superiority in this respect to his\\ntownsmen, the Meccans. But now that a trial was impending, I saw none\\nof the fearlessness so conspicuous when peril was only possible. The\\nchange was charitably to be explained by the presence of their\\nvaluables; the \"Sahharahs,\" like conscience, making cowards of them\\nall. But the young Meccan, who, having sent on his box by sea from\\nYambu\\'\\n</p><p>[p.270] to Jeddah, felt merry, like the empty traveller, would not lose\\nthe opportunity to pay off old scores. He taunted the Madinites till\\nthey stamped and raved with fury. At last, fearing some violence, and\\nfeeling answerable for the boy\\'s safety to his family, I seized him by\\nthe nape of his neck and the upper posterior portion of his nether\\ngarments, and drove him before me into the tent.\\n</p><p>When the hubbub had subsided, and all sat after supper smoking the pipe\\nof peace in the cool night air, I rejoined my companions, and found\\nthem talking, as usual, about old Shaykh Sa\\'ad. The scene was\\nappropriate for the subject. In the distance rose the blue peak said to\\nbe his eyrie, and the place was pointed out with fearful meaning. As it\\nis inaccessible to strangers, report has converted it into another\\ngarden of Iram. A glance, however, at its position and formation\\nsatisfied me that the bubbling springs, the deep forests, and the\\norchards of apple-trees, quinces and pomegranates, with which my\\ncompanions furnished it, were a \"myth,\" whilst some experience of Arab\\nignorance of the art of defence suggested to me strong doubts about the\\nexistence of an impregnable fortress on the hill-top. The mountains,\\nhowever, looked beautiful in the moonlight, and distance gave them a\\nsemblance of mystery well suited to the themes which they inspired.\\n</p><p>That night I slept within my Shugduf, for it would have been mere\\nmadness to sleep on the open plain in a place so infested by banditti.\\nThe being armed is but a poor precaution near this robbers\\' den. If you\\nwound a man in the very act of plundering, an exorbitant sum must be\\npaid for blood-money. If you kill him, even to save your life, then\\nadieu to any chance of escaping destruction. Roused three or four times\\nduring the night by jackals and dogs prowling about our little camp, I\\nobserved that my companions, who had agreed amongst themselves to keep\\nwatch by turns, had all\\n</p><p>[p.271] fallen into a sound sleep. However, when we awoke in the\\nmorning, the usual inspection of goods and chattels showed that nothing\\nwas gone.\\n</p><p>The next day (July 23rd) was a forced halt, a sore stimulant to the\\ntraveller\\'s ill-humour; and the sun, the sand, the dust, the furious\\nSamum, and the want of certain small supplies, aggravated our\\ngrievance. My sore foot had been inflamed by a dressing of onion skin\\nwhich the lady Maryam had insisted upon applying to it.[FN#7] Still\\nbeing resolved to push forward by any conveyance that could be\\nprocured, I offered ten dollars for a fresh dromedary to take me on to\\nAl- Madinah. Shaykh Hamid also declared he would leave his box in\\ncharge of a friend and accompany me. Sa\\'ad the Demon flew into a\\npassion at the idea of any member of the party escaping the general\\nevil; and he privily threatened Mohammed to cut off the legs of any\\ncamel that ventured into camp. This, the boy-who, like a boy of the\\nworld as he was, never lost an opportunity of making mischief-instantly\\ncommunicated to me, and it brought on a furious dispute. Sa\\'ad was\\nreproved and apologised for by the rest of the party; and presently he\\nhimself was pacified, principally, I believe, by the intelligence that\\nno camel was to be hired at Bir Abbas. One of the Arnaut garrison, who\\nhad obtained leave to go to Al-Madinah, came to ask us if we could\\nmount him, as otherwise he should be obliged to walk the whole way.\\nWith him we debated the propriety of attempting a passage through the\\nhills by one of the many by-paths that traverse them: the project was\\namply discussed, and duly rejected.\\n</p><p>We passed the day in the usual manner; all crowded\\n</p><p>[p.272] together for shelter under the tent. Even Maryam joined us,\\nloudly informing Ali, her son, that his mother was no longer a woman\\nbut a man; whilst our party generally, cowering away from the fierce\\nglances of the sun, were either eating or occasionally smoking, or were\\noccupied in cooling and drinking water. About sunset-time came a report\\nthat we were to start that night. None could believe that such good was\\nin store for us; before sleeping, however, we placed each camel\\'s pack\\napart, so as to be ready for loading at a moment\\'s notice; and we took\\ncare to watch that our Badawin did not drive their animals away to any\\ndistance. At last, about 11 P.M., as the moon was beginning to peep\\nover the Eastern wall of rock, was heard the glad sound of the little\\nkettle-drum calling the Albanian troopers to mount and march. In the\\nshortest possible time all made ready; and, hurriedly crossing the\\nsandy flat, we found ourselves in company with three or four Caravans,\\nforming one large body for better defence against the dreaded\\nHawamid.[FN#8] By dint of much manoeuvring, arms in hand,-Shaykh Hamid\\nand the \"Demon\" took the prominent parts,-we, though the last comers,\\nmanaged to secure places about the middle of the line. On such\\noccasions all push forward recklessly, as an English mob in the strife\\nof sight-seeing; the rear, being left unguarded, is the place of\\ndanger, and none seeks the honour of occupying it.\\n</p><p>We travelled that night up the Fiumara in an Easterly direction, and at\\nearly dawn (July 24th) found ourselves in an ill-famed gorge called\\nShuab al-Hajj,[FN#9] the \"Pilgrimage Pass.\" The loudest talkers became\\nsilent as we neared it, and their countenances showed apprehension\\nwritten in legible characters. Presently from the high precipitous\\n</p><p>[p.273] cliff on our left, thin blue curls of smoke-somehow or other\\nthey caught every eye-rose in the air; and instantly afterwards rang\\nthe sharp cracks of the hillmen\\'s matchlocks, echoed by the rocks on\\nthe right. My Shugduf had been broken by the camel\\'s falling during the\\nnight, so I called out to Mansur that we had better splice the\\nframework with a bit of rope: he looked up, saw me laughing, and with\\nan ejaculation of disgust disappeared. A number of Badawin were to be\\nseen swarming like hornets over the crests of the hills, boys as well\\nas men carrying huge weapons, and climbing with the agility of cats.\\nThey took up comfortable places on the cut-throat eminence, and began\\nfiring upon us with perfect convenience to themselves. The height of\\nthe hills and the glare of the rising sun prevented my seeing objects\\nvery distinctly, but my companions pointed out to me places where the\\nrock had been scarped, and where a kind of rough stone breastwork-the\\nSangah of Afghanistan-had been piled up as a defence, and a rest for\\nthe long barrel of the matchlock. It was useless to challenge the\\nBadawin to come down and fight us like men upon the plain; they will do\\nthis on the Eastern coast of Arabia, but rarely, if ever, in Al-Hijaz.\\nAnd it was equally unprofitable for our escort to fire upon a foe\\nensconced behind stones. Besides which, had a robber been killed, the\\nwhole country would have risen to a man; with a force of 3,000 or\\n4,000, they might have gained courage to overpower a Caravan, and in\\nsuch a case not a soul would have escaped. As it was, the Badawin\\ndirected their fire principally against the Albanians. Some of these\\ncalled for assistance to the party of Shaykhs that accompanied us from\\nBir Abbas; but the dignified old men, dismounting and squatting in\\ncouncil round their pipes, came to the conclusion that, as the robbers\\nwould probably turn a deaf ear to their words, they had better spare\\nthemselves the trouble of speaking.\\n</p><p>[p.274] We had therefore nothing to do but to blaze away as much\\npowder, and to veil ourselves in as much smoke, as possible; the result\\nof the affair was that we lost twelve men, besides camels and other\\nbeasts of burden. Though the bandits showed no symptoms of bravery, and\\nconfined themselves to slaughtering the enemy from their hill-top, my\\ncompanions seemed to consider this questionable affair a most gallant\\nexploit.\\n</p><p>After another hour\\'s hurried ride through the Wady Sayyalah, appeared\\nShuhada, to which we pushed on,\\n</p><p><br />\\n\"Like nighted swain on lonely road,\\nWhen close behind fierce goblins tread.\"\\n</p><p>Shuhada is a place which derives its name, \"The Martyrs,\" because here\\nare supposed to be buried forty braves that fell in one of Mohammed\\'s\\nmany skirmishes. Some authorities consider it the cemetery of the\\npeople of Wady Sayyalah.[FN#10] The once populous valley is now barren,\\nand one might easily pass by the consecrated spot without observing a\\nfew ruined walls and a cluster of rude Badawin graves, each an oval of\\nrough stones lying beneath the thorn trees on the left of and a little\\noff the road. Another half hour took us to a favourite halting-place,\\nBir al-Hindi,[FN#11] so called from some forgotten Indian\\n</p><p>[p.275] who dug a well there. But we left it behind, wishing to put as\\nmuch space as we could between our tents and the nests of the Hamidah.\\nThen quitting the Fiumara, we struck Northwards into a well-trodden\\nroad running over stony rising ground. The heat became sickening; here,\\nand in the East generally, at no time is the sun more dangerous than\\nbetween eight and nine A.M. Still we hurried on. It was not before\\neleven A.M. that we reached our destination, a rugged plain covered\\nwith stones, coarse gravel, and thorn trees in abundance; and\\nsurrounded by inhospitable rocks, pinnacle-shaped, of granite below,\\nand in the upper parts fine limestone. The well was at least two miles\\ndistant, and not a hovel was in sight; a few Badawi children belonging\\nto an outcast tribe fed their starveling goats upon the hills. This\\nplace is called \"Suwaykah\"; it is, I was told, that celebrated in the\\nhistory of the Arabs.[FN#12] Yet not for this reason did my comrades\\nlook lovingly upon its horrors: their boxes were safe and with the eye\\nof imagination they could now behold their homes. That night we must\\nhave travelled about twenty-two miles; the direction of the road was\\ndue East, and the only remarkable feature in the ground was its steady\\nrise.\\n</p><p>[p.276] We pitched the tent under a villainous Mimosa, the tree whose\\nshade is compared by poetic Badawin to the false friend who deserts you\\nin your utmost need. I enlivened the hot dull day by a final affair\\nwith Sa\\'ad the Demon. His alacrity at Yambu\\' obtained for him the loan\\nof a couple of dollars: he had bought grain at Al-Hamra, and now we\\nwere near Al-Madinah: still there was not a word about repayment. And\\nknowing that an Oriental debtor discharges his debt as he pays his\\nrent, namely, with the greatest unwillingness,-and that, on the other\\nhand, an Oriental creditor will devote the labour of a year to\\nrecovering a sixpence, I resolved to act as a native of the country,\\nplaced in my position, would; and by dint of sheer dunning and\\ndemanding pledges, to recover my property. About noon Sa\\'ad the Demon,\\nafter a furious rush, bare-headed, through the burning sun, flung the\\ntwo dollars down upon my carpet: however, he presently recovered\\ntemper, and, as subsequent events showed, I had chosen the right part.\\nHad he not been forced to repay his debt, he would have despised me as\\na \"freshman,\" and would have coveted more. As it was, the boy Mohammed\\nbore the brunt of unpopular feeling, my want of liberality being traced\\nto his secret and perfidious admonitions. He supported his burden the\\nmore philosophically, because, as he notably calculated, every dollar\\nsaved at Al-Madinah would be spent under his stewardship at Meccah.\\n</p><p>At four P.M. (July 24th) we left Suwaykah, all of us in the crossest of\\nhumours, and travelled in a N.E. direction. So \"out of temper\" were my\\ncompanions, that at sunset, of the whole party, Omar Effendi was the\\nonly one who would eat supper. The rest sat upon the ground, pouting,\\ngrumbling, and-they had been allowed to exhaust my stock of\\nLatakia-smoking Syrian tobacco as if it were a grievance. Such a game\\nat naughty children, I have seldom seen played even by Oriental men.\\nThe boy Mohammed\\n</p><p>[p.277] privily remarked to me that the camel-men\\'s beards were now in\\nhis fist,-meaning that we were out of their kinsmen, the Harb\\'s, reach.\\nHe soon found an opportunity to quarrel with them; and, because one of\\nhis questions was not answered in the shortest possible time, he\\nproceeded to abuse them in language which sent their hands flying in\\nthe direction of their swords. Despite, however, this threatening\\ndemeanour, the youth, knowing that he now could safely go to any\\nlengths, continued his ill words, and Mansur\\'s face was so comically\\nfurious, that I felt too much amused to interfere. At last the\\ncamel-men disappeared, thereby punishing us most effectually for our\\nsport. The road lay up rocky hill and down stony vale; a tripping and\\nstumbling dromedary had been substituted for the usual monture: the\\nconsequence was that we had either a totter or a tumble once per mile\\nduring the whole of that long night. In vain the now fiery Mohammed\\ncalled for the assistance of the camel-men with the full force of his\\nlungs: \"Where be those owls, those oxen of the oxen, those beggars,\\nthose cut-off ones, those foreigners, those Sons of Flight[FN#13]?\\nwithered be their hands! palsied be their fingers! the foul mustachioed\\nfellows, basest of the Arabs that ever hammered tent-peg, sneaking\\ncats, goats of Al-Akhfash![FN#14] Truly I will torture them the torture\\nof the oil,[FN#15] the mines of infamy! the cold of\\ncountenance![FN#16]\" The Badawi brotherhood of the camel-men looked at\\nhim wickedly, muttering the while,-\"By Allah! and by Allah!\\n</p><p>[p.278] and by Allah! O boy, we will flog thee like a hound when we\\ncatch thee in the Desert!\" All our party called upon him to desist, but\\nhis temper had got completely the upper hand over his discretion, and\\nhe expressed himself in such classic and idiomatic Hijazi, that I had\\nnot the heart to stop him. Some days after our arrival at Al-Madinah,\\nShaykh Hamid warned him seriously never again to go such perilous\\nlengths, as the Beni Harb were celebrated for shooting or poniarding\\nthe man who ventured to use to them even the mild epithet \"O jackass!\"\\nAnd in the quiet of the city the boy Mohammed, like a sobered man\\nshuddering at dangers braved when drunk, hearkened with discomposure\\nand penitence to his friend\\'s words. The only immediate consequence of\\nhis abuse was that my broken Shugduf became a mere ruin, and we passed\\nthe dark hours perched like two birds upon the only entire bits of\\nframework the cots contained.\\n</p><p>The sun had nearly risen (July 25th) before I shook off the lethargic\\neffects of such a night. All around me were hurrying their camels,\\nregardless of rough ground, and not a soul spoke a word to his\\nneighbour. \"Are there robbers in sight?\" was the natural question.\\n\"No!\" replied Mohammed; \"they are walking with their eyes,[FN#17] they\\nwill presently see their homes!\" Rapidly we passed the Wady\\nal-Akik,[FN#18] of which,\\n</p><p>\"O my friend, this is Akik, then stand by it,\\n</p><p>Endeavouring to be distracted by love, if not really a lover,\"[FN#19]\\n</p><p>[p.279] and a thousand other such pretty things, have been said by the\\nArab poets. It was as \"dry as summer\\'s dust,\" and its \"beautiful trees\"\\nappeared in the shape of vegetable mummies. Half an hour after leaving\\nthe \"Blessed Valley\" we came to a huge flight of steps roughly cut in a\\nlong broad line of black scoriaceous basalt.\\tThis is termed the\\nMudarraj or flight of steps over the western ridge of the so-called\\nAl-Harratayn.[FN#20] It is holy ground; for the Apostle spoke well of\\nit. Arrived at the top, we passed through a lane of dark lava, with\\nsteep banks on both sides, and after a few minutes a full view of the\\ncity suddenly opened upon us.[FN#21]\\n</p><p>We halted our beasts as if by word of command. All of us descended, in\\nimitation of the pious of old, and sat down, jaded and hungry as we\\nwere, to feast our eyes with a view of the Holy City.\\n</p><p>\"O Allah! this is the Harim (sanctuary) of Thy Apostle; make it to us a\\nProtection from Hell Fire, and a Refuge from Eternal Punishment! O open\\nthe Gates of Thy Mercy, and let us pass through them to the Land of\\nJoy!\" and \"O Allah, bless the last of Prophets, the Seal of Prophecy,\\nwith Blessings in number\\n</p><p>[p.280] as the Stars of Heaven, and the Waves of the Sea, and the Sands\\nof the Waste-bless him, O Lord of Might and Majesty, as long as the\\nCorn-field and the Date-grove continue to feed Mankind[FN#22]!\" And\\nagain, \"Live for ever, O Most Excellent of Prophets!-live in the Shadow\\nof Happiness during the Hours of Night and the Times of Day, whilst the\\nBird of the Tamarisk (the dove) moaneth like the childless Mother,\\nwhilst the West-wind bloweth gently over the Hills of Nijd, and the\\nLightning flasheth bright in the Firmament of Al-Hijaz!\"\\n</p><p>Such were the poetical exclamations that rose all around me, showing\\nhow deeply tinged with imagination becomes the language of the Arab\\nunder the influence of strong passion or religious enthusiasm. I now\\nunderstood the full value of a phrase in the Moslem ritual, \"And when\\nhis\" (the pilgrim\\'s) \"eyes shall fall upon the Trees of Al-Madinah, let\\nhim raise his Voice and bless the Apostle with the choicest of\\nBlessings.\" In al[l] the fair view before us nothing was more striking,\\nafter the desolation through which we had passed, than the gardens and\\norchards about the town. It was impossible not to enter into the spirit\\nof my companions, and truly I believe that for some minutes my\\nenthusiasm rose as high as theirs. But presently when we\\nremounted,[FN#23] the traveller returned strong upon me: I made a rough\\nsketch of the town, put questions about the principal buildings, and in\\nfact collected materials for the next chapter.\\n</p><p>[p.281] The distance traversed that night was about twenty-two miles in\\na direction varying from easterly to north-easterly. We reached\\nAl-Madinah on the 25th July, thus taking nearly eight days to travel\\nover little more than 130 miles. This journey is performed with camels\\nin four days, and a good dromedary will do it without difficulty in\\nhalf that time.[FN#24]\\n</p><p>[FN#1] The natives of Al-Hijaz assured me that in their Allah-favoured\\nland, the Samum never kills a man. I \"doubt the fact.\" This Arnaut\\'s\\nbody was swollen and decomposing rapidly, the true diagnostic of death\\nby the poison-wind. (See Ibn Batuta\\'s voyage, \"Kabul.\") However, as\\ntroopers drink hard, the Arabs may still be right, the Samum doing half\\nthe work, arrack the rest. I travelled during the months of July,\\nAugust, and September, and yet never found myself inconvenienced by the\\n\"poison-wind\" sufficiently to make me tie my Kufiyah, Badawi-fashion,\\nacross my mouth. At the same time I can believe that to an invalid it\\nwould be trying, and that a man almost worn out by hunger and fatigue\\nwould receive from it a coup de grace. Niebuhr attributes the\\nextraordinary mortality of his companions, amongst other causes, to a\\nwant of stimulants. Though these might doubtless be useful in the cold\\nweather, or in the mountains of Al-Yaman, for men habituated to them\\nfrom early youth, yet nothing, I believe, would be more fatal than\\nstrong drink when travelling through the Desert in summer heat. The\\ncommon beverage should be water or lemonade; the strongest stimulants\\ncoffee or tea. It is what the natives of the country do, and doubtless\\nit is wise to take their example. The Duke of Wellington\\'s dictum about\\nthe healthiness  of India to an abstemious man does not require to be\\nquoted. Were it more generally followed, we should have less of\\nsun-stroke and sudden death in our Indian armies, when soldiers, fed\\nwith beef and brandy, are called out to face the violent heat. At the\\nsame time it must be remembered, that foul and stagnant water,\\nabounding in organic matter, is the cause of half the diarrhoea and\\ndysentry which prove so fatal to travellers in these regions. To the\\nwater-drinker, therefore, a pocket-filter is indispensable.\\n[FN#2] Al-Shark, \"the East,\" is the popular name in the Hijaz for the\\nWestern region as far as Baghdad and Bassorah, especially Nijd. The\\nlatter province supplies the Holy Land with its choicest horses and\\ncamels. The great heats of the parts near the Red Sea appear\\nprejudicial to animal generation; whereas the lofty table-lands and the\\nbroad pastures of Nijd, combined with the attention paid by the people\\nto purity of blood, have rendered it the greatest breeding country in\\nArabia.\\n</p><p>[FN#3] I mean a civilised column. \"Herse\" is the old military name for\\na column opposed to \"Haye,\" a line. So we read that at far-famed Cressy\\nthe French fought en battaille a haye, the English drawn up en herse.\\nThis appears to have been the national predilection of that day. In\\nlater times, we and our neighbours changed style, the French preferring\\nheavy columns, the English extending themselves into lines.\\n[FN#4] The Albanians, delighting in the noise of musketry, notch the\\nball in order to make it sing the louder. When fighting, they often\\nadopt the excellent plan-excellent, when rifles are not procurable-of\\ndriving a long iron nail through the bullet, and fixing its head into\\nthe cartridge. Thus the cartridge is strengthened, the bullet is\\nrifled, and the wound which it inflicts is death. Round balls are apt\\nto pass into and out of savages without killing them, and many an\\nAfghan, after being shot or run through the body, has mortally wounded\\nhis English adversary before falling. It is false philanthropy, also,\\nto suppose that in battle, especially when a campaign is commencing, it\\nis sufficient to maim, not to kill, the enemy. Nothing encourages men\\nto fight so much, as a good chance of escaping with a wound-especially\\na flesh wound. I venture to hope that the reader will not charge these\\nsentiments with cruelty. He who renders warfare fatal to all engaged in\\nit will be the greatest benefactor the world has yet known.\\n[FN#5] The late Captain Nolan.\\n[FN#6] The first symptom of improvement will be a general training to\\nthe Bayonet exercise. The British is, and for years has been, the only\\narmy in Europe that does not learn the use of this weapon: how long\\ndoes it intend to be the sole authority on the side of ignorance? We\\nlaughed at the Calabrese levies, who in the French war threw away their\\nmuskets and drew their stilettos; and we cannot understand why the\\nIndian would always prefer a sabre to a rifle. Yet we read without\\ndisgust of our men being compelled, by want of proper training, to\\n\"club their muskets\" in hand-to-hand fights,-when they have in the\\nbayonet the most formidable of offensive weapons,-and of the Kafirs and\\nother savages wresting the piece, after drawing off its fire, from its\\nunhappy possessor\\'s grasp.\\n[FN#7] I began to treat it hydropathically with a cooling bandage, but\\nmy companions declared that the water was poisoning the wound, and\\ntruly it seemed to get worse every day. This idea is prevalent\\nthroughout Al-Hijaz; even the Badawin, after once washing a cut or a\\nsore, never allow air or water to touch it.\\n[FN#8] Hawamid is the plural of Hamidah, Shaykh Sa\\'ad\\'s tribe.\\n[FN#9] Shuab properly means a path through mountains, or a watercourse\\nbetween hills. It is generally used in Arabia for a \"Valley,\" and\\nsometimes instead of Nakb, or the Turkish Bughaz, a \"Pass.\"\\n</p>\\n<pre>[FN#10] Others attribute these graves to the Beni Salim, or Salmah, an\\n</pre>\\n<p>extinct race of Hijazi Badawin. Near Shuhada is Jabal Warkan, one of\\nthe mountains of Paradise, also called Irk al-Zabyat, or Thread of the\\nWinding Torrent. The Prophet named it \"Hamt,\" (sultriness), when he\\npassed through it on his way to the Battle of Badr. He also called the\\nvalley \"Sajasaj,\" (plural of Sajsaj, a temperate situation), declared\\nit was a valley of heaven, that 70 prophets had prayed there before\\nhimself, that Moses with 70,000 Israelites had traversed it on his way\\nto Meccah, and that, before the Resurrection day, Isa bin Maryam should\\npass through it with the intention of performing the Greater and the\\nLesser Pilgrimages. Such are the past and such the future honours of\\nthe place.\\n[FN#11] The Indians sink wells in Arabia for the same reason which\\nimpels them to dig tanks at home,-\"nam ke waste,\"-\"for the purpose of\\nname\"; thereby denoting, together with a laudable desire for posthumous\\nfame, a notable lack of ingenuity in securing it. For it generally\\nhappens that before the third generation has fallen, the well and the\\ntank have either lost their original names, or have exchanged them for\\nothers newer and better known.\\n[FN#12] Suwaykah derives its name from the circumstance that in the\\nsecond, or third, year of the Hijrah (Hegira), Mohammed here attacked\\nAbu Sufiyan, who was out on a foray with 200 men. The Infidels, in\\ntheir headlong fight, lightened their beasts by emptying their bags of\\n\"Sawik.\" This is the old and modern Arabic name for a dish of green\\ngrain, toasted, pounded, mixed with dates or sugar, and eaten on\\njourneys when it is found difficult to cook. Such is the present\\nsignification of the word: M.C. de Perceval (vol. iii., p. 84) gives it\\na different and a now unknown meaning. And our popular authors\\nerroneously call the affair the \"War of the Meal-sacks.\"\\n[FN#13] A popular but not a bad pun-\"Harb\" (Fight), becomes, by the\\nalteration of the H, \"Harb\" (Flight).\\n[FN#14] The old Arabic proverb is \"A greater wiseacre than the goat of\\nAkhfash\"; it is seldom intelligible to the vulgar.\\n[FN#15] That is to say, \"I will burn them (metaphorically) as the fiery\\nwick consumes the oil,\"-a most idiomatic Hijazi threat.\\n[FN#16] A \"cold-of-countenance\" is a fool. Arabs use the word \"cold\" in\\na peculiar way. \"May Allah refrigerate thy countenance!\" i.e. may it\\nshow misery and want. \"By Allah, a cold speech!\" that is to say, a\\nsilly or an abusive tirade.\\n[FN#17] That is to say, they would use, if necessary, the dearest and\\nnoblest parts of their bodies (their eyes) to do the duty of the basest\\n(i.e. their feet).\\n[FN#18] Writers mention two Al-Akik. The superior comprises the whole\\nsite of Al-Madinah, extending from the Western Ridge, mentioned below,\\nto the cemetery Al-Bakia. The inferior is the Fiumara here alluded to;\\nit is on the Meccan road, about four miles S.W. of Al-Madinah, and its\\nwaters fall into the Al-Hamra torrent. It is called the \"Blessed\\nValley\" because the Prophet was ordered by an angel to pray in it.\\n[FN#19] The esoteric meaning of this couplet is, \"Man! this is a lovely\\nportion of God\\'s creation: then stand by it, and here learn to love the\\nperfections of thy Supreme Friend.\"\\n[FN#20] Al-Harratayn for Al-Harratani, the oblique case of the dual and\\nplural noun being universally used for the nominative in colloquial\\nArabic. The other one of the Two Ridges will be described in a future\\npart of this Book.\\n[FN#21] The city is first seen from the top of the valley called Nakb,\\nor Shuab Ali, close to the Wady al-Akik, a long narrow pass, about five\\nmiles from Al-Madinah. Here, according to some, was the Mosque Zu\\'l\\nHalifah, where the Prophet put on the Pilgrim\\'s garb when travelling to\\nMeccah. It is also called \"The Mosque of the Tree,\" because near it\\ngrew a fruit tree under which the Prophet twice sat. Ibn Jubayr\\nconsiders that the Harim (or sacred precincts of Al-Madinah) is the\\nspace enclosed by three points, Zu\\'l Halifah, Mount Ohod, and the\\nMosque of Kuba. To the present day pilgrims doff their worldly garments\\nat Zu\\'l Halifah.\\n[FN#22] That is to say, \"throughout all ages and all nations.\" The\\nArabs divide the world into two great bodies: first themselves, and,\\nsecondly, \"\\'Ajami,\" i.e. all that are not Arabs. Similar bi-partitions\\nare the Hindus and Mlenchhas, the Jews and Gentiles, the Greeks and\\nBarbarians, &amp;c., &amp;c.\\n[FN#23] Robust religious men, especially those belonging to the school\\nof Al-Malik, enter into Al-Madinah, after the example of Ali, on foot,\\nreverently, as the pilgrims approach Meccah.\\n[FN#24] Barbosa makes three days\\' journey from Yambu\\' to Al-Madinah,\\nD\\'Herbelot eight, and Ovington six. The usual time is from four to five\\ndays. A fertile source of error to home geographers, computing\\ndistances in Arabia, is their neglecting the difference between the\\nslow camel travelling and the fast dromedary riding.\\n\\tThe following is a synopsis of our stations:-\\n</p><p><br />\\n</p>\\n<hr /><p>Miles.\\n</p><p>1.

Before us lay a spacious plain, bounded in front by the\\nundulating ground of Nijd: on the left was a grim pile of rocks, the\\ncelebrated Mount Ohod, with a clump of verdure and a white dome or two\\nnestling at its base. Rightwards, broad streaks of lilac-coloured\\nmists, here thick with gathered dew, there pierced and thinned by the\\nmorning rays, stretched over the date groves and the gardens of Kuba,\\nwhich stood out in emerald green from the dull tawny surface of the\\nplain. Below, distant about two miles, lay Al-Madinah; at first sight\\nit appeared a large place, but a closer inspection proved the\\nimpression to be erroneous. A tortuous road from the Harrah to the city\\nwound across the plain, and led to a tall rectangular gateway, pierced\\nin the ruinous mud-wall which surrounds the suburb. This is the\\n\"Ambari\" entrance. It is flanked on the left (speaking as a sketcher)\\nby the domes and minarets of a pretty Turkish building, a \"Takiyah,\"\\nerected by the late Mohammed Ali for the reception of Darwaysh\\ntravellers; on the right by a long low line of white-washed buildings\\ngarnished\\n</p><p>[p.286] with ugly square windows, an imitation of civilised barracks.\\nBeginning from the left hand, as we sat upon the ridge, the remarkable\\nfeatures of the town thus presented themselves in succession. Outside,\\namong the palm trees to the north of the city, were the picturesque\\nruins of a large old Sabil, or public fountain; and, between this and\\nthe enceinte, stood a conspicuous building, in the Turkish pavilion\\nstyle-the Governor\\'s palace. On the north-west angle of the town-wall\\nis a tall white-washed fort, partly built upon an outcropping mass of\\nrock: its ramparts and embrasures give it a modern and European\\nappearance, which contrasts strangely with its truly Oriental\\nhistory.[FN#1] In the suburb \"Al-Manakhah,\" the \"kneeling-place of\\ncamels,\" the bran-new domes and minarets of the Five Mosques stand\\nbrightly out from the dull grey mass of house and ground. And behind,\\nin the most Easterly part of the city, remarkable from afar, is the gem\\nof Al-Madinah,-the four tall substantial towers, and the flashing green\\nDome under which the Apostle\\'s remains rest.[FN#2] Half concealed by\\nthis mass of buildings and by the houses of the town, are certain white\\nspecks upon a green surface, the tombs that adorn the venerable\\ncemetery, Al-Bakia. From that point southwards begins the mass of palm\\ngroves celebrated in Al-Islam as the \"Trees of Al-Madinah.\"\\n</p><p>[p.287] The foreground is well fitted to set off such a view; fields of\\nblack basaltic scoriae showing clear signs of a volcanic origin, are\\nbroken up into huge blocks and boulders, through which a descent,\\ntolerably steep for camels, winds down into the plain.\\n</p><p>After a few minutes\\' rest I remounted, and slowly rode on towards the\\ngate. Even at this early hour the way was crowded with an eager\\nmultitude coming out to meet the Caravan. My companions preferred\\nwalking, apparently for the better convenience of kissing, embracing,\\nand s[h]aking hands with relations and friends. Truly the Arabs show\\nmore heart on these occasions than any Oriental people I know; they are\\nof a more affectionate nature than the Persians, and their manners are\\nfar more demonstrative than those of the Indians. The respectable\\nMaryam\\'s younger son, a pleasant contrast to her surly elder, was\\nweeping aloud for joy as he ran round his mother\\'s camel, he standing\\non tiptoe, she bending double in vain attempts to exchange a kiss; and,\\ngenerally, when near relatives or intimates, or school companions, met,\\nthe fountains of their eyes were opened. Friends and comrades greeted\\none another, regardless of rank or fortune, with affectionate embraces,\\nand an abundance of queries, which neither party seemed to think of\\nanswering. The general mode of saluting was to throw one arm over the\\nshoulder and the other round the side, placing the chin first upon the\\nleft and then upon the right collar-bone, and rapidly shifting till a\\n\"jam satis\" suggested itself to both parties. Inferiors recognized\\ntheir superiors by attempting to kiss hands, which were violently\\nsnatched away; whilst mere acquaintances gave each other a cordial\\n\"poignee de mains,\" and then raising the finger tips to their lips,\\nkissed them with apparent relish.\\n</p><p>Passing through the Bab Ambari we defiled slowly down a broad dusty\\nstreet, and traversed the Harat\\n</p><p>[p.288] (Quarter), Al-Ambariyah, the principal in the Manakhah suburb.\\nThe thoroughfare is by no means remarkable after Cairo; only it is\\nrather wider and more regular than the traveller is accustomed to in\\nAsiatic cities. I was astonished to see on both sides of the way, in so\\nsmall a place, so large a number of houses too ruinous to be occupied.\\nThen we crossed a bridge, a single little round arch of roughly hewn\\nstone, built over the bed of a torrent, Al-Sayh,[FN#3] which in some\\nparts appeared about fifty feet broad, with banks showing a high and\\ndeeply indented water-mark. Here the road abuts upon an open space\\ncalled the \"Barr al-Manakhah.[FN#4] or more concisely Al-Barr, \"the\\nPlain.\" Straightforward a line leads directly into the Bab al-Misri,\\nthe Egyptian gate of the city. But we turned off to the right; and,\\nafter advancing a few yards, we found ourselves at the entrance of our\\nfriend Hamid\\'s house.\\n</p><p>The Shaykh had preceded us early that morning, in order to prepare an\\napartment for his guests, and to receive the first loud congratulations\\nand embraces of his mother and the \"daughter of his uncle.[FN#5]\"\\nApparently he had not concluded this pleasing duty when we arrived, for\\nthe camels were kneeling at least five minutes at his door, before he\\ncame out to offer the usual hospitable salutation. I stared to see the\\ndifference of his appearance this morning. The razor had passed over\\nhis head\\n</p><p>[p.289] and face[FN#6]; the former was now surmounted by a muslin\\nturband of goodly size, wound round a new embroidered cap; and the\\nlatter, besides being clean, boasted of neat little moustaches turned\\nup like two commas, whilst a well-trimmed goat\\'s beard narrowed until\\nit resembled what our grammars call an \"exclamation point.\" The dirty,\\ntorn shirt, with the bits of rope round the loins, had been exchanged\\nfor a Jubbah or outer cloak of light pink merinos, a long-sleeved\\nCaftan of rich flowered stuff, a fine shirt of Halaili,[FN#7] silk and\\ncotton, and a sash of plaid pattern, elaborately fringed at both ends,\\nand, for better display, wound round two-thirds of his body. His\\npantaloons were also of Halaili, with tasteful edgings about the ankles\\nlike a \"pantilette\\'s,\" while his bare and sun-burnt feet had undergone\\na thorough purification before being encased in new Mizz[FN#8] (inner\\nslippers), and Papush (outer slippers), of bright lemon-coloured\\nleather of the newest and most fashionable Constantinopolitan cut. In\\none of his now delicate hands the Shaykh bore a mother-of-pearl rosary,\\ntoken of piety; in the other a handsome pipe with a jasmine stick, and\\nan expensive amber mouth-piece; his tobacco pouch, dangling from his\\nwaist, like the little purse in the bosom pocket of his coat, was of\\nbroadcloth richly embroidered with gold. In course of time I saw that\\nall\\n</p><p>[p.290] my companions had metamorphosed themselves in an equally\\nremarkable manner. As men of sense they appeared in tatters where they\\nwere, or when they wished to be, unknown, and in fine linen where and\\nwhen the world judged their prosperity by their attire. Their grand\\nsuits of clothes, therefore, were worn only for a few days after\\nreturning from the journey, by way of proof that the wearer had\\nwandered to some purpose; they were afterwards laid up in lavender, and\\nreserved for choice occasions, as old ladies in Europe store up their\\nstate dresses.\\n</p><p>The Shaykh, whose manners had changed with his garments, from the\\nvulgar and boisterous to a certain staid courtesy, took my hand, and\\nled me up to the Majlis\\n[FN#9] (parlour), which was swept and garnished, with all due\\napparatus, for the forthcoming reception-ceremony. And behind us\\nfollowed the boy Mohammed, looking more downcast and ashamed of himself\\nthan I can possibly describe; he was still in his rags, and he felt\\nkeenly that every visitor staring at him would mentally inquire,-\\n</p><p>\"Who may that snob be?\"\\n</p><p>With the deepest dejectedness he squeezed himself into a corner, and\\nShaykh Nur, who was foully dirty, as an Indian en voyage always is,\\nwould have joined him in his shame, had I not ordered the \"slave\" to\\nmake himself generally useful.\\n</p><p>It is customary for all relations and friends to call upon the\\ntraveller the very day he returns, that is to say, if amity is to\\nendure. The pipes therefore stood ready filled, the Diwans were duly\\nspread, and the coffee[FN#10] was being boiled upon a brazier in the\\npassage.\\n</p><p>[p.291] Scarcely had I taken my place at the cool windowsill,-it was\\nthe best in the room,-when the visitors began to pour in, and the\\nShaykh rose to welcome and embrace them. They sat down, smoked, chatted\\npolitics, asked all manner of questions about the other wayfarers and\\nabsent friends; drank coffee; and, after half an hour\\'s visit, rose\\nabruptly, and, exchanging embraces, took leave. The little men entered\\nthe assembly, after an accolade at the door, noiselessly, squatted upon\\nthe worst seats with polite conges to the rest of the assembly; smoked,\\ntook their coffee, as it were, under protest, and glided out of the\\nroom as quietly as they crept in.\\n</p><p>The great people, generally busy and consequential individuals, upon\\nwhose countenances were writ large the words \"well to do in the world,\"\\nappeared with a noise that made each person in the room rise\\nreverentially upon his feet; sat down with importance, monopolised the\\nconversation; and, departing in a dignified manner, expected all to\\nstand on the occasion.\\n</p><p>The Jihad (Holy War), as usual, was the grand topic of conversation.\\nThe Sultan had ordered the Czar to become a Moslem. The Czar had sued\\nfor peace, and offered tribute and fealty. But the Sultan had exclaimed-\\n</p><p>\"No, by Allah! Al-Islam!\"\\n</p><p>[p.292] The Czar could not be expected to take such a step without a\\nlittle hesitation, but \"Allah smites the faces of the Infidels!\" Abd\\nal-Majid would dispose of the \"Moskow[FN#11]\" in a short time; after\\nwhich he would turn his victorious army against all the idolaters of\\nFeringistan, beginning with the English, the French, and the Arwam or\\nGreeks.[FN#12] Amongst much of this nonsense,-when applied to for my\\nopinion, I was careful to make it popular,-I heard news foreboding no\\ngood to my journey towards Maskat. The Badawin had decided that there\\nwas to be an \"Arab contingent,\" and had been looking forward to the\\nspoils of Europe: this caused quarrels, as all the men wanted to go,\\nand not a ten-year-old would be left behind. The consequence was, that\\nthis amiable people was fighting in all directions. At least so said\\nthe visitors, and I afterwards found out that they were not far wrong.\\n</p><p>The Samman is a great family, in numbers as in dignity; from 8 A.M.\\ntill mid-day therefore the Majlis was crowded with people, and\\npoliteness delayed our breakfasts until an unconscionable hour.\\n</p><p>To the plague of strangers succeeded that of children. No sooner did\\nthe parlour become, comparatively speaking, vacant than they rushed in\\nen masse, treading upon our toes, making the noise of a nursery of\\nmadlings, pulling to pieces everything they could lay their hands upon,\\nand using language that would have alarmed an old\\nman-o\\'war\\'s-man.[FN#13] In fact, no one can conceive the plague but\\n</p><p>[p.293] those who have studied the \"enfan[t]s terribles\" which India\\nsends home in cargoes.\\n</p><p>One urchin, scarcely three years old, told me, because I objected to\\nhis perching upon my wounded foot, that his father had a sword at home\\nwith which he would cut my throat from ear to ear, suiting the action\\nto the word. By a few taunts, I made the little wretch furious with\\nrage; he shook his infant fist at me, and then opening his enormous\\nround black eyes to their utmost stretch, he looked at me, and licked\\nhis knee with portentous meaning. Shaykh Hamid, happening to come in at\\nthe moment, stood aghast at the doorway, chin in hand, to see the\\nEffendi subject to such indignity; and it was not without trouble that\\nI saved the offender from summary nursery discipline. Another scamp\\ncaught up one of my loaded pistols before I could snatch it out of his\\nhand, and clapped it to his neighbour\\'s head; fortunately, it was on\\nhalf-cock, and the trigger was stiff. Then a serious and majestic boy\\nabout six years old, with an inkstand in his belt, in token of his\\nreceiving a literary education, seized my pipe and began to smoke it\\nwith huge puffs. I ventured laughingly to institute a comparison\\nbetween the length of his person and the pipe-stick, when he threw it\\nupon the ground, and stared at me fixedly with flaming eyes and\\nfeatures distorted by anger. The cause of this \"bouldness\" soon\\nappeared. The boys, instead of being well beaten, were scolded with\\nfierce faces, a mode of punishment which only made them laugh.\\n</p><p>They had their redeeming points, however; they were manly angry boys,\\nwho punched one another like Anglo-Saxons in the house, whilst abroad\\nthey were always\\n</p><p>[p.294] fighting with sticks and stones. And they examined our\\nweapons,-before deigning to look at anything else,-as if eighteen\\ninstead of five had been the general age.\\n</p><p>At last I so far broke through the laws of Arab politeness as to inform\\nmy host in plain words-how inconceivably wretched the boy Mohammed was\\nthereby rendered!-that I was hungry, thirsty, and sleepy, and that I\\nwanted to be alone before visiting the Harim. The good-natured Shaykh,\\nwho was preparing to go out at once in order to pray before his\\nfather\\'s grave, immediately brought me breakfast; lighted a pipe,\\nspread a bed, darkened the room, turned out the children, and left me\\nto the society I most desired-my own. I then overheard him summon his\\nmother, wife, and other female relatives into the store-room, where his\\ntreasures had been carefully stowed away. During the forenoon, in the\\npresence of the visitors, one of Hamid\\'s uncles had urged him, half\\njocularly, to bring out the Sahharah. The Shaykh did not care to do\\nanything of the kind. Every time a new box is opened in this part of\\nthe world, the owner\\'s generosity is appealed to by those whom a\\nrefusal offends, and he must allow himself to be plundered with the\\nbest possible grace. Hamid therefore prudently suffered all to depart\\nbefore exhibiting his spoils; which, to judge by the exclamations of\\ndelight which they elicited from feminine lips, proved highly\\nsatisfactory to those most concerned.\\n</p><p>After sleeping, we all set out in a body to the Harim, as this is a\\nduty which must not be delayed by the pious. The boy Mohammed was in\\nbetter spirits, the effect of having borrowed from Hamid, amongst other\\narticles of clothing, an exceedingly gaudy embroidered coat. As for\\nShaykh Nur, he had brushed up his Tarbush, and, by means of some\\ncast-off dresses of mine, had made himself look like a respectable\\nAbyssinian slave, in a nondescript toilette, half Turkish, half Indian.\\nI propose to reserve\\n</p><p>[p.295] the ceremony of Ziyarat, or Visitation, for another chapter,\\nand to conclude this with a short account of our style of living at the\\nShaykh\\'s hospitable house.\\n</p><p>Hamid\\'s abode is a small corner building, open on the North and East to\\nthe Barr al-Manakhah: the ground floor shows only a kind of vestibule,\\nin which coarse articles, like old Shugdufs, mats and bits of sacking,\\nare lying about; the rest are devoted to purposes of sewerage.\\nAscending dark winding steps of ragged stone covered with hard black\\nearth, you come to the first floor, where the men live. It consists of\\ntwo rooms to the front of the house, one a Majlis, and another\\nconverted into a store. Behind them is a dark passage, into which the\\ndoors open; and the back part of the first story is a long windowless\\nroom, containing a Hanafiyah,[FN#14] or large copper water-pot, and\\nother conveniences for purification. On the second floor is the\\nkitchen, which I did not inspect, it being as usual occupied by the\\n\"Harim.\"\\n</p><p>The Majlis has dwarf windows, or rather apertures in the northern and\\neastern walls, with rude wooden shutters and reed blinds; the\\nembrasures being garnished with cushions, where you sit, morning and\\nevening, to enjoy the cool air. The ceiling is of date-sticks laid\\nacross palm-rafters stained red, and the walls are of rough scoriae,\\nburnt bricks, and wood-work cemented with lime. The only signs of\\nfurniture in the sitting-room are a Diwan[FN#15] round the sides and a\\ncarpet in the centre. A\\n</p><p>[p.296] huge wooden box, like a seaman\\'s chest, occupies one of the\\ncorners. In the southern wall there is a Suffah, or little shelf of\\ncommon stone, sunk under a single arch; upon this are placed articles\\nin hourly use, perfume-bottles, coffee-cups, a stray book or two, and\\nsometimes a turband, to be out of the children\\'s way. Two hooks on the\\nwestern wall, hung jealously high up, hold a pair of pistols with\\nhandsome crimson cords and tassels, and half a dozen cherry-stick\\npipes. The centre of the room is never without one or more\\nShishas[FN#16] (water pipes), and in the corner is a large copper\\nbrazier containing fire, with all the utensils for making coffee either\\ndisposed upon its broad brim or lying about the floor. The passage,\\nlike the stairs, is spread over with hard black earth, and is regularly\\nwatered twice a day during the hot weather.\\n</p><p>The household consisted of Hamid\\'s mother, wife, some nephews and\\nnieces, small children who ran about in a half-wild and more than\\nhalf-nude state, and two African slave girls. When the Damascus Caravan\\ncame\\n</p><p>[p.297] in, it was further reinforced by the arrival of his three\\nyounger brothers.\\n</p><p>Though the house was not grand, it was made lively by the varied views\\nout of the Majlis\\' windows. From the East, you looked upon the square\\nAl-Barr, the town walls and houses beyond it, the Egyptian gate, the\\nlofty minarets of the Harim, and the distant outlines of Jabal\\nOhod.[FN#17] The north commanded a prospect of Mohammed\\'s Mosque, one\\nof the Khamsah Masajid,[FN#18] or the five suburban Mosques[FN#19]; of\\npart of the fort-wall; and, when the Damascus Caravan came in, of the\\ngay scene of the \"Prado\" beneath. The Majlis was tolerably cool during\\nthe early part of the day: in the afternoon the sun shone fiercely upon\\nit. I have described the establishment at some length as a specimen of\\nhow the middle classes are lodged at Al-Madinah. The upper ranks affect\\nTurkish and Egyptian luxuries in their homes, as I had an opportunity\\nof seeing at Omar Effendi\\'s house in the \"Barr;\" and in these countries\\nthe abodes of the poor are everywhere very similar.\\n</p><p>Our life in Shaykh Hamid\\'s house was quiet, but not disagreeable. I\\nnever once set eyes upon the face of woman, unless the African slave\\ngirls be allowed the title. Even these at first attempted to draw their\\nragged veils over their sable charms, and would not answer the simplest\\nquestion; by degrees they allowed me to see them, and they ventured\\ntheir voices to reply to me; still they never threw off a certain\\nappearance of shame.[FN#20]\\n</p><p>[p.298] I never saw, nor even heard, the youthful mistress of the\\nhousehold, who stayed all day in the upper rooms. The old lady, Hamid\\'s\\nmother, would stand upon the stairs, and converse aloud with her son,\\nand, when few people were about the house, with me. She never, however,\\nas afterwards happened to an ancient dame at Meccah, came and sat by my\\nside.\\n</p><p>When lying during mid-day in the gallery, I often saw parties of women\\nmount the stairs to the Gynaeconitis, and sometimes an individual would\\nstand to shake a muffled hand[FN#21] with Hamid, to gossip awhile, and\\nto put some questions concerning absent friends; but they were most\\ndecorously wrapped up, nor did they ever deign to deroger, even by\\nexposing an inch of cheek.\\n</p><p>At dawn we arose, washed, prayed, and broke our fast[FN#22] upon a\\ncrust of stale bread, before smoking a pipe, and drinking a cup of\\ncoffee.[FN#23] Then it was time to dress, to mount, and to visit the\\nHarim or one of the Holy Places outside the city. Returning before the\\nsun became intolerable, we sat together, and with conversation, Shishas\\nand Chibuks,[FN#24] coffee, and cold water perfumed with\\nmastich-smoke,[FN#25] we whiled away the time till our\\n</p><p>[p.299] \"Ariston,\" a dinner which appeared at the primitive hour of 11\\nA.M. The meal, here called Al-Ghada, was served in the Majlis on a\\nlarge copper tray, sent from the upper apartments. Ejaculating\\n\"Bismillah\"-the Moslem \"grace\"-we all sat round it, and dipped equal\\nhands in the dishes set before us. We had usually unleavened bread,\\ndifferent kinds of meat and vegetable stews; and, at the end of the\\nfirst course, plain boiled rice eaten with spoons; then came the\\nfruits, fresh dates, grapes, and pomegranates.\\n</p><p>After dinner I used invariably to find some excuse-such as the habit of\\na \"Kaylulah[FN#26]\" (mid-day siesta) or the being a \"Saudawi[FN#27]\"-a\\nperson of melancholy temperament-to have a rug spread in the dark\\npassage behind\\n</p><p>[p.300] the Majlis; and there to lie reading, dozing, smoking, or\\nwriting, en cachette, in complete deshabille, all through the worst\\npart of the day, from noon to sunset.\\n</p><p>Then came the hour for receiving or paying visits. We still kept up an\\nintimacy with Omar Effendi and Sa\\'ad the Demon, although Salih Skakkar\\nand Amm Jamal, either disliking our society, or perhaps thinking our\\nsphere of life too humble for their dignity, did not appear once in\\nHamid\\'s house. The evening prayers ensued, either at home, or in the\\nHarim, followed by our Asha or \"deipnon,\" another substantial meal like\\nthe dinner, but more plentiful, of bread, meat, vegetables, plain rice\\nand fruits, concluding with the invariable pipes and coffee.\\n</p><p>To pass our soiree, we occasionally dressed in common clothes,\\nshouldered a Nabbut,[FN#28] and went to the cafe; sometimes on festive\\noccasions we indulged in a Taatumah (or Itmiyah), a late supper of\\nsweetmeats, pomegranates, and dried fruits. Usually we sat upon\\nmattresses spread upon the ground in the open air at the Shaykh\\'s door;\\nreceiving evening visits, chatting, telling stories, and making merry,\\ntill each, as he felt the approach of the drowsy god, sank down into\\nhis proper place, and fell asleep.\\n</p><p>Whatever may be the heat of the day, the night at Al-Madinah, owing, I\\nsuppose, to its elevated position, is cool and pleasant. In order to\\nallay the dust, the ground before the Shaykh\\'s door was watered every\\nevening, and the evaporation was almost too great to be safe,-the boy\\nMohammed suffered from a smart attack of lumbago,\\n</p><p>[p.301] which, however, yielded readily to frictions of olive oil in\\nwhich ginger had been boiled.\\n</p><p>Our greatest inconvenience at night-time was the pugnacity of the\\nanimal creation. The horses of the troopers tethered in the Barr were\\nsure to break loose once in twelve hours. Some hobbled old nag, having\\nslipped the headstall, would advance with kangaroo-leaps towards a\\nneighbour against whom it had a private grudge. Their heads would touch\\nfor a moment; then came a snort and a whinny, a furious kick, and,\\nlastly, a second horse loose and dashing about with head and tail\\nviciously cocked. This was the signal for a general breaking of halters\\nand heel-ropes; after which, a \"stampede\" scoured the plain, galloping,\\nrearing, kicking, biting, snorting, pawing, and screaming, with the\\ndogs barking sympathetically, and the horse-keepers shouting in hot\\npursuit.\\n</p><p>It was a strange sight to see by moonlight the forms of these \"demon\\nsteeds\" exaggerated by the shades; and, on more than one occasion, we\\nhad all to start up precipitately from our beds, and yield them to a\\ncouple of combatants who were determined to fight out their quarrel a\\nl\\'outrance, wherever the battle-field might be.\\n</p><p>The dogs at Al-Madinah are not less pugnacious than the horses.[FN#29]\\nThey are stronger and braver than those that haunt the streets at\\nCairo; like the Egyptians, they have amongst themselves a system of\\npolice regulations, which brings down all the posse comitatus upon the\\nunhappy straggler who ventures into a strange quarter of the town. They\\ncertainly met in Al-Barr upon common\\n</p><p>[p.302] ground, to decide the differences which must arise in so\\nartificial a state of canine society.\\n</p><p>Having had many opportunities of watching them, I can positively assert\\nthat they were divided into two parties, which fought with a skill and\\nan acharnement that astounded me. Sometimes when one side gave way, and\\nas the retreat was degenerating into a sauve qui peut, some proud\\nwarrior, a dog-hero, would sacrifice himself for the public weal, and\\nwith gnashing teeth and howls of rage encounter the assaults of the\\ninsolent victors until his flying friends had time to recover heart.\\nSuch an one my companions called \"Mubariz.[FN#30]\" At other times, some\\nhuge animal, an Ajax of his kind, would plunge into the ring with\\nfrantic yells, roll over one dog, snap at a second, worry a third for a\\nminute or two, and then dash off to a distant part, where a thicker\\nfield required his presence. This uncommon sagacity has been remarked\\nby the Arabs, who look on amused at their battles. Current in Al-Hijaz\\nare also certain superstitions about the dog resembling ours; only, as\\nusual, more poetical and less grotesque. Most people believe that when\\nthe animal howls without apparent cause in the neighbourhood of a\\nhouse, it forbodes death to one of the inmates; for the dog they say\\ncan distinguish the awful form of Azrail, the Angel of Death, hovering\\nover the doomed abode, whereas man\\'s spiritual sight is dull and dim by\\nreason of his sins.\\n</p><p>When the Damascus Caravan entered Al-Madinah, our day became a little\\nmore amusing. From the windows of Shaykh Hamid\\'s house there was a\\nperpetual succession of strange scenes. A Persian nobleman, also, had\\npitched his tents so near the door, that the whole course of his\\nprivate life became public and patent to the boy Mohammed,\\n</p><p>[p.303] who amused his companions by reporting all manner of ludicrous\\nscenes. The Persian\\'s wife was rather a pretty woman, and she excited\\nthe youth\\'s fierce indignation, by not veiling her face when he gazed\\nat her,-thereby showing that, as his beard was not grown, she\\nconsidered him a mere boy.\\n</p><p>\"I will ask her to marry me,\" said Mohammed, \"and thereby rouse her\\nshame!\"\\n</p><p>He did so, but, unhappy youth! the fair Persian never even ceased\\nfanning herself.\\n</p><p>The boy Mohammed was for once confounded.\\n</p><p>[FN#1] In the East, wherever there is a compound of fort and city, that\\nplace has certainly been in the habit of being divided against itself.\\nSurat in Western India is a well-known instance. I must refer the\\nreader to Burckhardt (Travels in Arabia, vol. ii., page 281, and\\nonwards) for a detailed account of the feuds and affrays between the\\n\"Agha of the Castle\" and the \"Agha of the Town.\" Their day has now gone\\nby,-for the moment.\\n[FN#2] Sir John Mandeville, writing in the 14th century, informed\\nEurope that \"Machomet lyeth in the Cytee of Methone.\" In the 19th\\ncentury, Mr. Halliwell, his editor, teaches us in a foot-note that\\n\"Methone\" is Meccah! It is strange how often this gross mistake is\\nstill made by respectable authors in France as well as in England.\\n[FN#3] This torrent is called Al-Sayh,-\"the Running Water,\"-which,\\nproperly speaking, is the name of a well-wooded Wady outside the town,\\nin the direction of Kuba.\\n[FN#4] \"Manakhah\" is a place where camels kneel down; it is a\\nderivation from the better known root to \"Nakh,\" or cause the animal to\\nkneel.\\n[FN#5] Arabs, and, indeed, most Orientals, are generally received after\\nreturning from a journey, with shrill cries of joy by all the fair part\\nof the household, and they do not like strangers to hear this\\ndemonstration.\\n[FN#6] An Eastern Barber is not content to pass the razor over hairy\\nspots: he must scrape the forehead, trim the eyebrows, clean the\\ncheeks, run the blade rapidly over the nose, correct the upper and\\nunder lines of the mustaches, parting them in the centre, and so on.\\n[FN#7] Halaili is a cotton stuff, with long stripes of white silk, a\\nfavourite material amongst the city Arabs. At Constantinople, where the\\nbest is sold, the piece, which will cut into two shirts, costs about\\nthirty shillings.\\n[FN#8] The \"Mizz\" (in colloquial Arabic Misd) are the tight-fitting\\ninner slippers of soft Cordovan leather, worn as stockings inside the\\nslipper; they are always clean, so they may be retained in the Mosque\\nor on the Diwan (divan or sofa).\\n[FN#9] The Majlis (\"the Place of Sitting\") is the drawing or reception\\nroom; it is usually in the first story of the house, below the\\napartments of the women.\\n[FN#10] The coffee drank at Al-Madinah is generally of a good quality.\\nIn Egypt that beverage in the common coffee-shops is,-as required to be\\nby the people who frequent those places,-\"bitter as death, black as\\nSatan, and hot as Jahannam.\" To effect this desideratum, therefore,\\nthey toast the grain to blackness, boil it to bitterness, and then\\ndrink scalding stuff of the consistency of water-gruel. At Al-Madinah,\\non the contrary,-as indeed in the houses of the better classes even in\\nEgypt,-the grain is carefully picked, and that the flavour may be\\npreserved, it is never put upon the fire until required. It is toasted\\ntoo till it becomes yellow, not black; and afterwards is bruised, not\\npounded to powder. The water into which it is thrown is allowed to boil\\nup three times, after which a cold sprinkling is administered to clear\\nit, and then the fine light-dun infusion is poured off into another\\npot. Those who admire the \"Kaimak,\" or froth, do not use a second\\nvessel. The Arabs seldom drink more than one cup of coffee at a time,\\nbut with many the time is every half-hour of the day. The coffee-husk\\nor \"Kishr\" of Al-Yaman is here unknown.\\n[FN#11] The common name for the Russians in Egypt and Al-Hijaz.\\n[FN#12] The Greeks are well known at Al-Madinah, and several of the\\nhistorians complain that some of the minor holy places had fallen into\\nthe hands of this race, (Moslems, or pretended Moslems, I presume), who\\nprevented people visiting them. It is curious that the impostor\\nCagliostro should have hit upon the truth when he located Greeks at\\nAl-Madinah\\n[FN#13] Parents and full-grown men amuse themselves with grossly\\nabusing children, almost as soon as they can speak, in order to excite\\ntheir rage, and to judge of their dispositions. This supplies the\\ninfant population with a large stock-in-trade of ribaldry. They\\nliterally lisp in bad language.\\n[FN#14] The Hanafiyah is a large vessel of copper, sometimes tinned,\\nwith a cock in the lower part, and, generally, an ewer, or a basin, to\\nreceive the water.\\n[FN#15] It is wonderful that this most comfortable, inexpensive, and\\nornamental style of furnishing a room, has not been oftener imitated in\\nIndia and the hot countries of Europe. The Diwan-it must not be\\nconfounded with the leathern perversion which obtains that name in our\\nclub smoking-rooms-is a line of flat cushions ranged round the room,\\neither placed upon the ground, or on wooden benches, or on a step of\\nmasonry; varying in height according to the fashion of the day. When\\nsuch foundation is used, it should be about a yard in breadth, and\\nslope very gently from the outer edge towards the wall, for the greater\\nconvenience of reclining. Cotton-stuffed pillows, covered with chintz\\nfor summer, and silk for winter, are placed against the wall, and can\\nbe moved to make a luxurious heap; their covers are generally all of\\nthe same colour, except those at the end. The seat of honour is denoted\\nby a small square cotton-stuffed silk coverlet, placed in one of the\\ncorners, which the position of the windows determines, the place of\\ndistinction being on the left of the host. Thus in Egypt you have a\\nneatly-furnished room for L5 or L6.\\n[FN#16] The Madinah Shisha is a large cocoa-nut, with a tall wooden\\nstem, both garnished with brass ornaments; some trifling differences in\\nthe latter distinguish it from the Meccah pipe. Both are inconveniently\\nmounted upon small brass tripods, and are easily overturned, scattering\\nfire and water over the carpets. The \"lay,\" or snakes, are the\\nsubstantial manufacture of Al-Yaman. Some grandees at Al-Madinah have\\nglass Turkish Shishas and Constantinople snakes, which are of admirable\\nelegance, compared with the clumsy and unsightly Arab inventions. (See\\npage 80, ante.)\\n[FN#17] From this window I sketched the walls and the Egyptian gate of\\nAl-Madinah.\\n[FN#18] \"Five mosques.\"\\n[FN#19] This Mosque must not be confounded with the Harim. It is\\ndescribed in Chapter XV.\\n[FN#20] Their voices are strangely soft and delicate, considering the\\nappearance of the organs from which they proceed. Possibly this may be\\na characteristic of the African races; it is remarkable amongst the\\nSomali women.\\n[FN#21] After touching the skin of a strange woman, it is not lawful in\\nAl-Islam to pray without ablution. For this reason, when a fair dame\\nshakes hands with you, she wraps up her fingers in a kerchief, or in\\nthe end of her veil.\\n[FN#22] Nafukku\\'r rik, literally, \"Let us open the saliva,\" is most\\nidiomatic Hijazi for the first morsel eaten in the morning. Hence it is\\ncalled Fakkur\\' rik, also Gura and Tasbih: the Egyptians call it\\n\"Al-Fatur.\"\\n[FN#23] Orientals invariably begin by eating an \"akratisma\" in the\\nmorning before they will smoke a pipe, or drink a cup of coffee; they\\nhave also an insuperable prejudice against the internal use of cold\\nwater at this hour.\\n[FN#24] The tobacco generally smoked here is Syrian, which is brought\\ndown in large quantities by the Damascus caravan. Latakia is more\\nexpensive, and generally too dry to retain its flavour.\\n[FN#25] The interior of the water jar is here perfumed with the smoke\\nof mastich, exactly as described by Lane, (Mod. Egyptians, vol i. ch.\\n5). I found at Al-Madinah the prejudice alluded to by Sonnini, namely,\\nthat the fumes of the gum are prejudicial, and sometimes fatal to\\ninvalids.\\n[FN#26] Kaylulah is the half hour\\'s siesta about noon. It is a Sunnat,\\nand the Prophet said of it, \"Kilu, fa inna \\'sh\\' Shayatina la\\nTakil,\"-\"Take the mid-day siesta, for, verily, the demons sleep not at\\nthis hour.\" \"Aylulah\" is slumbering after morning prayers (our \"beauty\\nsleep\"), which causes heaviness and inability to work. Ghaylulah is the\\nsleeping about 9 A.M., the effect of which is poverty and wretchedness.\\nKaylulah (with the guttural kaf) is sleeping before evening prayers, a\\npractice reprobated in every part of the East. And, finally, Faylulah\\nis sleeping immediately after sunset,-also considered highly\\ndetrimental.\\n[FN#27] The Arabs, who suffer greatly from melancholia, are kind to\\npeople afflicted with this complaint; it is supposed to cause a\\ndistaste for society, and a longing for solitude, an unsettled habit of\\nmind, and a neglect of worldly affairs. Probably it is the effect of\\noverworking the brain, in a hot dry atmosphere. I have remarked, that\\nin Arabia students are subject to it, and that amongst their\\nphilosophers and literary men, there is scarcely an individual who was\\nnot spoken of as a \"Saudawi.\" My friend Omar Effendi used to complain,\\nthat at times his temperament drove him out of the house,-so much did\\nhe dislike the sound of the human voice,-to pass the day seated upon\\nsome eminence in the vicinity of the city.\\n[FN#28] This habit of going out at night in common clothes, with a\\nNabbut upon one\\'s shoulders, is, as far as I could discover, popular at\\nAl-Madinah, but confined to the lowest classes at Meccah. The boy\\nMohammed always spoke of it with undisguised disapprobation. During my\\nstay at Meccah, I saw no such costume amongst respectable people there;\\nthough oftentimes there was a suspicion of a disguise.\\n[FN#29] Burckhardt (Travels in Arabia, vol. ii., p. 268) remarks that\\nAl-Madinah is the only town in the East from which dogs are excluded.\\nThis was probably as much a relic of Wahhabi-ism, (that sect hating\\neven to look at a dog), as arising from apprehension of the Mosque\\nbeing polluted by canine intrusion. I have seen one or two of these\\nanimals in the town, but I was told, that when they enter it in any\\nnumbers, the police-magistrate issues orders to have them ejected.\\n[FN#30] The \"Mubariz\" is the single combatant, the champion of the\\nArabian classical and chivalrous times.\\n</p>\\n<h2><span id=\"Chapter_XVI._A_VISIT_TO_THE_PROPHET.27S_TOMB.\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Chapter_XVI._A_VISIT_TO_THE_PROPHET\\'S_TOMB.\">Chapter XVI.

As my foot still\\ngave me great pain, Shaykh Hamid sent for a donkey. A wretched animal\\nappeared, raw-backed, lame of one leg, and wanting an ear, with\\naccoutrements to match, a pack-saddle without stirrups, and a halter\\ninstead of a bridle. Such as the brute was, however, I had to mount it,\\nand to ride through the Misri gate, to the wonder of certain Badawin,\\nwho, like the Indians, despise the ass.\\n</p><p>\"Honourable is the riding of a horse to the rider,\\nBut the mule is a dishonour, and the donkey a disgrace,\"\\n</p><p>says their song. The Turkish pilgrims, however, who appear to take a\\npride in ignoring all Arab points of prejudice, generally mount donkeys\\nwhen they cannot walk. The Badawin therefore settled among themselves,\\naudibly enough, that I was an Osmanli, who of course could not\\nunderstand Arabic, and they put the question generally,\\n</p><p>\"By what curse of Allah had they been subjected to ass-riders?\"\\n</p><p>But Shaykh Hamid is lecturing me upon the subject of the Mosque.\\nThe Masjid Al-Nabawi, or the Prophet\\'s Mosque, is one of the Haramayn,\\nor the \"two sanctuaries\" of Al-Islam,\\n</p><p>[p.305] and is the second of the three[FN#1] most venerable places of\\nworship in the world; the other two being the Masjid al-Harim at Meccah\\n(connected with Abraham) and the Masjid al-Aksa of Jerusalem (the\\npeculiar place of Solomon). A Hadis or traditional saying of Mohammed\\nasserts, \"One prayer in this my Mosque is more efficacious than a\\nthousand in other places, save only the Masjid al-Harim.[FN#2]\" It is\\ntherefore the visitor\\'s duty, as long as he stays at Al-Madinah, to\\npray there the five times per diem, to pass the day in it reading the\\nKoran, and the night, if possible, in watching and devotion.\\n</p><p>A visit to the Masjid al-Nabawi, and the holy spots within it, is\\ntechnically called \"Ziyarat\" or Visitation.[FN#3] An essential\\ndifference is made between this rite and Hajj or pilgrimage. The latter\\nis obligatory by Koranic order upon every Moslem once in his life: the\\nformer is only a meritorious action. \"Tawaf,\" or circumambulation of\\nthe House of Allah at Meccah, must never be performed at the Apostle\\'s\\ntomb. This should not be visited in the Ihram or pilgrim dress; men\\nshould not kiss it, touch it with the hand, or press the bosom against\\nit, as at the Ka\\'abah; or rub the face with dust collected near the\\nsepulchre; and those who prostrate themselves before it, like certain\\nignorant Indians, are held to be\\n</p><p>[p.306] guilty of deadly sin. On the other hand, to spit upon any part\\nof the Mosque, or to treat it with contempt, is held to be the act of\\nan Infidel.\\n</p><p>Thus the learned and religious have settled, one would have thought,\\naccurately enough the spiritual rank and dignity of the Masjid\\nal-Nabawi. But mankind, especially in the East, must always be in\\nextremes. The orthodox school of Al-Malik holds Al-Madinah, on account\\nof the sanctity of, and the religious benefits to be derived from,\\nMohammed\\'s tomb, more honourable than Meccah. Some declare that the\\nApostle preferred his place of refuge, blessing it as Abraham did\\nMeccah. Moreover, as a tradition declares that every man\\'s body is\\ndrawn from the ground in which he is buried, Al-Madinah evidently had\\nthe honour of supplying materials for the Apostle\\'s person. Others,\\nlike Omar, were uncertain which to prefer. The Wahhabis, on the other\\nhand, rejecting the Intercession of the Apostle on the Day of Judgment,\\nconsidering the grave of a mere mortal unworthy of notice, and highly\\ndisgusted by the idolatrous respect paid to it by certain foolish\\nMoslems, plundered the sacred building with sacrilegious violence, and\\nforbade visitors from distant countries to enter Al-Madinah.[FN#4]\\n</p><p>The general consensus of Al-Islam admits the superiority of the Bayt\\nAllah (\"House of God\") at Meccah to the whole world; and declares\\nAl-Madinah to be more venerable than every part of Meccah, and\\nconsequently all the earth, except only the Bayt Allah. This last is a\\njuste milieu view by no means in favour with the inhabitants of either\\nplace. In the meanwhile the Meccans claim unlimited superiority over\\nthe Madani: the Madani over the Meccans.\\n</p><p>[p.307]Passing through muddy streets,-they had been freshly watered\\nbefore evening time,-I came suddenly upon the Mosque. Like that at\\nMeccah, the approach is choked up by ignoble buildings, some actually\\ntouching the holy \"enceinte,\" others separated by a lane compared with\\nwhich the road round St. Paul\\'s is a Vatican Square.[FN#5] There is no\\nouter front, no general prospect of the Prophet\\'s Mosque; consequently,\\nas a building, it has neither beauty nor dignity.\\n</p><p>And entering the Bab al-Rahmah[FN#6]-the Gate of Pity,-by a diminutive\\nflight of steps, I was astonished at the mean and tawdry appearance of\\na place so universally venerated in the Moslem world. It is not, like\\nthe Meccan Temple, grand and simple, the expression of a single sublime\\nidea: the longer I looked at it, the more it suggested the resemblance\\nof a museum of second-rate art, an old Curiosity-shop, full of\\nornaments that are not accessories, and decorated with pauper splendour.\\n</p><p>The Masjid al-Nabi is a parallelogram about four hundred and twenty\\nfeet in length by three hundred and forty broad, the direction of the\\nlong walls being nearly north and south. As usual in Al-Islam, it is a\\nhypaethral building with a spacious central area, called Al-Sahn,\\nAl-Hosh, Al-Haswah, or Al-Ramlah,[FN#7] surrounded by a peristyle with\\nnumerous rows of pillars like the colonnades of an Italian cloister.\\nThe arcades or porticoes are flat-ceilinged, domed above with the small\\nMedia\\n</p><p>[p.308] Naranja, or half-orange cupola of Spain, and divided into four\\nparts by narrow passages, three or four steps below the level of the\\npavement. Along the whole inner length of the Northern short wall runs\\nthe Majidi Riwak, so called from the then reigning Sultan.[FN#8] The\\nWestern long wall is occupied by the Riwak of the Rahmah Gate; the\\nEastern by that of the Bab al-Nisa, the \"Women\\'s Entrance.[FN#9]\"\\n</p><p>Embracing the inner length of the Southern short wall, and deeper by\\nnearly treble the amount of columns than the other porticoes, is the\\nmain colonnade, called Al-Rauzah[FN#10] (the Garden), the adytum\\ncontaining all that is venerable in the building. These four Riwaks,\\narched externally, are supported internally by pillars of different\\nshape and material, varying from fine porphyry to dirty plaster. The\\nSouthern, where the sepulchre or cenotaph stands, is paved with\\nhandsome slabs of white marble and marquetry work, here and there\\ncovered with coarse matting, and above this by unclean carpets, well\\nworn by faithful feet.[FN#11]\\n</p><p>But this is not the time for Tafarruj or lionising.\\n</p><p>[p.309] Shaykh Hamid warns me, with a nudge, that other things are\\nexpected of a Zair (visitor). He leads me to the Bab al-Salam, fighting\\nhis way through a troop of beggars, and inquires markedly if I am\\nreligiously pure.[FN#12] Then, placing our hands a little below and on\\nthe left of the waist, the palm of the right covering the back of the\\nleft, in the position of prayer, and beginning with the dexter\\nfeet,[FN#13] we pace slowly forwards down the line called the Muwajihat\\nal-Sharifah, or \"the Illustrous Fronting,\" which, divided off like an\\naisle, runs parallel with the Southern wall of the Mosque. On my right\\nhand walks the Shaykh, who recites aloud the following prayer, making\\nme repeat it after him.[FN#14] It is literally rendered, as, indeed,\\nare all the formulae, and the reader is requested to excuse the\\nbarbarous fidelity of the translation.\\n</p><p>\"In the Name of Allah and in the faith of Allah\\'s Apostle! O Lord,\\ncause me to enter the Entering of Truth, and cause me to issue forth\\nthe Issuing of Truth, and permit me to draw near to Thee, and make me a\\nSultan Victorious[FN#15]!\" Then follow blessings upon the Apostle, and\\nafterwards: \"O Allah! open to me the Doors of Thy Mercy, and grant me\\nEntrance into it, and protect me from the Stoned Devil!\"\\n</p><p>During this preliminary prayer we had passed down two-thirds of the\\nMuwajihat al-Sharifah. On the left hand is a dwarf wall, about the\\nheight of a man, painted with arabesques, and pierced with four small\\ndoors which\\n</p><p>[p.310] open into the Muwajihat. In this barrier are sundry small\\nerections, the niche called the Mihrab Sulaymani,[FN#16] the Mambar, or\\npulpit, and the Mihrab al-Nabawi.[FN#17]\\n</p><p>The two niches are of beautiful mosaic, richly worked with various\\ncoloured marbles, and the pulpit is a graceful collection of slender\\ncolumns, elegant tracery, and inscriptions admirably carved. Arrived at\\nthe Western small door in the dwarf wall, we entered the celebrated\\nspot called Al-Rauzah, after a saying of the Apostle\\'s, \"Between my\\nTomb and my Pulpit is a Garden of the Gardens of Paradise.[FN#18]\" On\\nthe North and West sides it is\\n</p><p>[p.311] not divided from the rest of the portico; on the South runs the\\ndwarf wall, and on the East it is limited by the west end of the\\nlattice-work containing the tomb.\\n</p><p>Accompanied by my Muzawwir I entered the Rauzah, and was placed by him\\nwith the Mukabbariyah[FN#19] behind me, fronting Meccah, with my right\\nshoulder opposite to, and about twenty feet distant from, the dexter\\npillar of the Apostle\\'s Pulpit.[FN#20] There, after saying the\\nafternoon prayers,[FN#21] I performed the usual two bows in honour of\\nthe temple,[FN#22] and at the end of them recited the hundred and ninth\\nand the hundred and twelfth chapters of the Koran-the \"Kul, ya\\nayyuha\\'l-Kafiruna,\" and the \"Surat al-Ikhlas,\" called also the \"Kul,\\nHuw\\' Allah,\" or the Declaration of Unity; and may be thus translated:\\n</p><p>\"Say, He is the one God!\\n\"The eternal God!\\n\"He begets not, nor is He begot!\\n</p><p>[p.312] \"And unto Him the like is not.\"\\n</p><p>After which was performed a single Sujdah (Prostration) of\\nThanks,[FN#23] in gratitude to Allah for making it my fate to visit so\\nholy a spot.\\n</p><p>This being the recognised time to give alms, I was besieged by beggars,\\nwho spread their napkins before us on the ground, sprinkled with a few\\ncoppers to excite generosity. But not wishing to be distracted by them,\\nbefore leaving Hamid\\'s house I had changed two dollars, and had given\\nthe coin to the boy Mohammed, who accompanied me, strictly charging him\\nto make that sum last through the Mosque.\\n</p><p>My answer to the beggars was a reference to my attendant, backed by the\\nsimple action of turning my pockets inside out; and, whilst he was\\nbattling with the beggars, I proceeded to cast my first coup-d\\'oeil\\nupon the Rauzah.\\n</p><p>The \"Garden\" is the most elaborate part of the Mosque. Little can be\\nsaid in its praise by day, when it bears the same relation to a\\nsecond-rate church in Rome as an English chapel-of-ease to Westminster\\nAbbey. It is a space of about eighty feet in length, tawdrily decorated\\nso as to resemble a garden. The carpets are flowered, and the pediments\\nof the columns are cased with bright green tiles, and adorned to the\\nheight of a man with gaudy and unnatural vegetation in arabesque. It is\\ndisfigured by handsome branched candelabras of cut crystal, the work, I\\nbelieve, of a London house, and presented to the shrine by the late\\nAbbas Pasha of Egypt.[FN#24]\\n</p><p>The only admirable feature of the view is the light\\n</p><p>[p.313] cast by the windows of stained glass[FN#25] in the Southern\\nwall. Its peculiar background, the railing of the tomb, a splendid\\nfiligree-work of green and polished brass, gilt or made to resemble\\ngold, looks more picturesque near than at a distance, when it suggests\\nthe idea of a gigantic bird-cage. But at night the eye, dazzled by\\noil-lamps[FN#26] suspended from the roof, by huge wax candles, and by\\nsmaller illuminations falling upon crowds of visitors in handsome\\nattire, with the richest and the noblest of the city sitting in\\ncongregation when service is performed,[FN#27] becomes less critical.\\nStill the scene must be viewed with Moslem bias, and until a man is\\nthoroughly imbued with the spirit of the East, the last place the\\nRauzah will remind him of, is that which the architect primarily\\nintended it to resemble-a garden.\\n</p><p>Then with Hamid, professionally solemn, I reassumed the position of\\nprayer, and retraced my steps. After passing through another small door\\nin the dwarf wall that bounds the Muwajihah, we did not turn to the\\nright, which would have led us to the Bab al-Salam; our course was in\\nan opposite direction, towards the Eastern wall of the temple.\\nMeanwhile we repeated, \"Verily Allah and His Angels[FN#28] bless the\\nApostle! O ye who believe, bless him,\\n</p><p>[p.314] and salute Him with Honour!\" At the end of this prayer, we\\narrived at the Mausoleum, which requires some description before the\\nreader can understand the nature of our proceedings there.\\n</p><p>The Hujrah[FN#29] or \"Chamber\" as it is called, from the circumstance\\nof its having been Ayishah\\'s room, is an irregular square of from fifty\\nto fifty-five feet in the South-East corner of the building, and\\nseparated on all sides from the walls of the Mosque by a passage about\\ntwenty-six feet broad on the South side, and twenty on the East. The\\nreason of this isolation has been before explained, and there is a\\nsaying of Mohammed\\'s, \"O Allah, cause not my Tomb to become an Object\\nof Idolatrous Adoration! May Allah\\'s Wrath fall heavy upon the People\\nwho make the Tombs of their Prophets Places of Prayer[FN#30]!\"\\n</p><p>[p.315] Inside there are, or are supposed to be, three tombs facing the\\nSouth, surrounded by stone walls without any aperture, or, as others\\nsay, by strong planking.[FN#31] Whatever this material may be, it is\\nhung outside with a curtain, somewhat like a large four-post bed. The\\nexternal railing is separated by a dark narrow passage from the inner,\\nwhich it surrounds; and is of iron filigree painted of a vivid grass\\ngreen,-with a view to the garden. Here carefully inserted in the\\nverdure, and doubly bright by contrast, is the gilt or burnished brass\\nwork forming the long and graceful letters of the Suls character, and\\ndisposed into the Moslem creed, the Profession of Unity, and similar\\nreligious sentences.\\n</p><p>On the South side, for greater honour, the railing is plated over with\\nsilver, and silver letters are interlaced with it. This fence, which\\nconnects the columns and forbids passage to all men, may be compared to\\nthe baldacchino of Roman churches. It has four gates: that to the South\\nis the Bab al-Muwajihah; Eastward is the gate of our Lady Fatimah;\\nwestward the Bab al-Taubah (of Repentance), opening into the Rauzah or\\ngarden; and to the North, the Bab al-Shami or Syrian gate. They are\\nconstantly kept closed, except the fourth, which admits, into the dark\\nnarrow passage above alluded to, the officers who have charge of the\\ntreasures there deposited; and the eunuchs who sweep the floor, light\\n[p.316] the lamps, and carry away the presents sometimes thrown in here\\nby devotees.[FN#32]\\n</p>\\n<div class=\"floatleft\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Burton_Tomb_Hierarchy.PNG\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Burton Tomb Hierarchy.PNG\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a1/Burton_Tomb_Hierarchy.PNG/250px-Burton_Tomb_Hierarchy.PNG\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"250\" height=\"357\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a1/Burton_Tomb_Hierarchy.PNG 1.5x\" data-file-width=\"260\" data-file-height=\"371\" /></a></div><p>In the Southern side of the fence are three windows, holes about half a\\nfoot square, and placed from four to five feet above the ground; they\\nare said to be between three and four cubits distant from the Apostle\\'s\\nhead. The most Westerly of these is supposed to front Mohammed\\'s tomb,\\nwherefore it is called the Shubak al-Nabi, or the Prophet\\'s window. The\\nnext, on the right as you front it, is Abu Bakr\\'s, and the most\\nEasterly of the three is Omar\\'s.\\n</p><p>Above the Hujrah is the Green Dome, surmounted outside by a large gilt\\ncrescent springing from a series of globes. The glowing imaginations of\\nthe Moslems crown this gem of the building with a pillar of heavenly\\nlight, which directs from three days\\' distance the pilgrims\\' steps\\ntowards Al-Madinah. But alas! none save holy men (and perhaps, odylic\\nsensitives), whose material organs are piercing as their spiritual\\nvision, may be allowed the privilege of beholding this poetic splendour.\\n</p><p>Arrived at the Shubak al-Nabi, Hamid took his stand about six feet or\\nso out of reach of the railing, and at that respectful distance from,\\nand facing[FN#33] the Hazirah (or presence),\\n</p><p>[p.317] with hands raised as in prayer, he recited the following\\nsupplication in a low voice, telling me in a stage whisper to repeat it\\nafter him with awe, and fear, and love:-\\n</p><p>\"Peace be upon Thee, O Apostle of Allah, and the Mercy of Allah and his\\nBlessings!

I bear Witness that there is no god but the\\nGod (Allah), and I testify that Thou art His Servant, and His Apostle,\\nand His Faithful Follower, and Best Creature. And I bear Witness, O\\nApostle of Allah! that Thou hast delivered thy Message, and discharged\\nThy Trust, and advised Thy Faith, and opened Grief, and published\\nProofs, and fought valiantly for Thy Lord, and worshipped Thy God till\\nCertainty came to Thee (i.e. to the hour of death). And we Thy Friends,\\nO Apostle of Allah! appear before Thee, Travellers from distant lands\\nand far Countries, through Dangers and Difficulties, in the Times of\\nDarkness, and in the Hours of Day, longing to give Thee Thy Rights\\n(i.e. to honour Thee by benediction and visitation), and to obtain the\\nBlessings of Thine Intercession, for our Sins have broken our Backs,\\nand Thou intercedest with the Healer. And Allah said,[FN#34] \\xef\\xbf\\xbdAnd\\nthough they have injured themselves, they came to Thee, and begged Thee\\nto secure their Pardon, and they found God an Acceptor of Penitence,\\nand full of Compassion.\\' O Apostle of Allah, Intercession!\\nIntercession! Intercession[FN#35]! O Allah, bless Mohammed and\\nMohammed\\'s Family, and give Him Superiority and high Rank, even as Thou\\ndidst promise Him, and graciously allow us to conclude this Visitation.\\nI deposit on this spot, and near Thee, O Apostle of God, my everlasting\\nProfession (of faith) from this our Day, to the Day of Judgment, that\\nthere is no god but Allah, and that our Lord Mohammed is His Servant\\nand His Apostle.[FN#36] Amen! O Lord of the (three) Worlds![FN#37]\"\\n</p><p>[p.319] After which, performing Ziyarat[FN#38] for ourselves, we\\nrepeated the Fatihah or \"opening\" chapter of the Koran.\\n</p><p>\"In the name of Allah, the Merciful, the Compassionate!\\n\"Praise be to Allah, who the (three) Worlds made.\\n\"The Merciful, the Compassionate.\\n\"The King of the Day of Faith.\\n\"Thee (alone) do we worship, and of Thee (alone) do we ask Aid.\\n\"Guide us to the Path that is straight-\\n\"The Path of those for whom thy Love is great, not those on whom is\\nHate, nor they that deviate.\\n\"Amen! O Lord of Angels, Jinnis, and Men![FN#39]\"\\n</p><p>After reciting this mentally with upraised hands, the forefinger of the\\nright hand being extended to its full length, we drew our palms down\\nour faces and did alms-deeds, a vital part of the ceremony. Thus\\nconcludes the first part of the ceremony of visitation at the Apostle\\'s\\ntomb.\\n</p><p>[p.320] Hamid then stepped about a foot and half to the right, and I\\nfollowed his example, so as to place myself exactly opposite the second\\naperture in the grating called Abu Bakr\\'s window. There, making a sign\\ntowards the mausoleum, we addressed its inmate, as follows:-\\n</p><p>\"Peace be upon Thee, O Abu Bakr, O Thou Truthful One! Peace be upon\\nThee, O Caliph of Allah\\'s Apostle over his People! Peace be upon Thee,\\nO Companion of the Cave, and Friend in Travel! Peace be upon Thee, O\\nThou Banner of the Fugitives and the Auxiliaries! I testify Thou didst\\never stand firm in the right Way, and wast a Smiter of the Infidel, and\\na Benefactor to Thine own people. Allah grant Thee through His Apostle\\nWeal! We pray Almighty God to cause us to die in Thy Friendship, and to\\nraise us up in Company with His Apostle and Thyself, even as He hath\\nmercifully vouchsafed to us this Visitation.[FN#40]\"\\n</p><p>After which we closed one more step to the right, and standing opposite\\nOmar\\'s window, the most easterly of the three, after making a sign with\\nour hands, we addressed the just Caliph in these words:-\\n</p><p>\"Peace be upon Thee, O Omar! O Thou Just One! Thou Prince of True\\nBelievers! Peace be upon Thee, who spakest with Truth, and who madest\\nThy Word agree with the Strong Book! (the Koran): O Thou Faruk! (the\\nSeparator).[FN#41] O Thou Faithful One! who girdedst thy Loins with the\\nApostle, and the First Believers, and with them didst make up the full\\nNumber forty,[FN#42] and thus causedst to be accomplished the Apostle\\'s\\nPrayer,[FN#43] and\\n</p><p>[p.321] then didst return to Thy God a Martyr leaving the World with\\nPraise! Allah grant Thee, through his Apostle and his Caliph and his\\nFollowers, the best of Good, and may Allah feel in Thee plenary\\nSatisfaction!\"\\n</p><p>Shaykh Hamid, after wrenching a beggar or two from my shoulders, then\\npermitted me to draw near to the little window, called the Apostle\\'s,\\nand to look in. Here my proceedings were watched with suspicious eyes.\\nThe Persians have sometimes managed to pollute the part near Abu Bakr\\'s\\nand Omar\\'s graves by tossing through the aperture what is externally a\\nhandsome shawl intended as a present for the tomb.[FN#44] After\\nstraining my eyes for a time, I saw a curtain,[FN#45] or rather\\nhangings, with\\n</p><p>[p.322] three inscriptions in long gold letters, informing readers that\\nbehind them lie Allah\\'s Apostle and the first two Caliphs.\\n</p><p>The exact place of Mohammed\\'s tomb is moreover distinguished by a large\\npearl rosary, and a peculiar ornament, the celebrated Kaukab-al-Durri,\\nor constellation of pearls, suspended to the curtain\\nbreast-high.[FN#46] This is described to be a \"brilliant star set in\\ndiamonds and pearls,\" placed in the dark that man\\'s eye may be able to\\nbear its splendours: the vulgar believe it to be a \"jewel of the jewels\\nof Paradise.\" To me it greatly resembled the round glass stoppers used\\nfor the humbler sort of decanters; but I thought the same of the\\nKoh-i-Nur. Moreover I never saw it quite near enough to judge fairly,\\nand I did not think fit to pay an exorbitant sum for the privilege of\\nentering the inner passage of the baldaquin.[FN#47]\\n</p><p>[p.323] Altogether the coup-d\\'oeil had nothing to recommend it by day.\\nAt night, when the lamps, hung in this passage, shed a dim light upon\\nthe mosaic-work of the marble floors, upon the glittering inscriptions,\\nand the massive hangings, the scene is more impressive.\\n</p><p>Never having seen the Tomb,[FN#48] I must depict it from books,-by no\\nmeans an easy task. Most of the historians are silent after describing\\nthe inner walls of the Hujrah. Al-Kalkashandi declares in eo lapidem\\nnobilem continere sepulchra Apostoli, Abubecr et Omar, circumcinctum\\nperibole in modum conclavis fere usque ad tectum assurgente, quae velo\\nserico nigro obligatur. This author, then, agrees with my Persian\\nfriends, who declare the sepulchre to be a marble slab. Ibn Jubayr, who\\ntravelled in A.H. 580, relates that the Apostle\\'s coffin is a box of\\nebony (abnus) covered with sandal-wood, and plated with silver; it is\\nplaced, he says, behind a curtain, and surrounded by an iron grating.\\nAl-Samanhudi,[FN#49] quoted by Burckhardt, declares that the curtain\\ncovers a square building of black stones, in the interior of which are\\nthe tombs of Mohammed and of his two immediate successors. He adds that\\nthe tombs are\\n</p><p>[p.324] deep holes; and that the coffin which contains the Apostle is\\ncased with silver, and has on the top a marble slab inscribed\\n\"Bismillah! Allahumma salli alayh!\" (\"In the name of Allah! Allah have\\nMercy upon Him[FN#50]!\")\\n</p><p>The Apostle\\'s body, it should be remembered, lies, or is supposed to\\nlie, stretched at full length on the right side, with the right palm\\nsupporting the right cheek, the face fronting Meccah, as Moslems are\\nalways buried, and consequently the body lies with the head almost due\\nWest and the feet due East. Close behind him is placed Abu Bakr, whose\\nface fronts the Apostle\\'s shoulder[FN#51]; and, lastly, Omar holds the\\nsame position with respect to his predecessor.\\n</p><p>The places they are usually supposed to occupy, then, would be thus\\ndisposed. But Moslem historians are not agreed even upon so simple a\\npoint as this. [p.325] Many prefer this position, in line [figure]\\n-some thus, in unicorn [figure] -and others the right angle.[FN#52]\\n[figure]\\n</p><p>It is popularly asserted that in the Hujrah there is now spare place\\nfor only a single grave, reserved for Isa bin Maryam after his second\\ncoming. The historians of Al-Islam are full of tales proving that\\nthough many of their earlier saints, as Osman the Caliph and Hasan the\\nImam, were desirous of being buried there; and that although Ayishah,\\nto whom the room belonged, willingly acceded to their wishes, son of\\nman has as yet been unable to occupy it.\\n</p><p>After the Fatihah pronounced at Omar\\'s tomb, and the short inspection\\nof the Hujrah, Shaykh Hamid led me round the south-east corner of the\\nbaldaquin.[FN#53] Turning\\n</p><p>[p.326] towards the north, we stopped at what is commonly called the\\nMahbat Jibrail (\"Place of the Archangel Gabriel\\'s Descent with the\\nHeavenly Revelations\"), or simply Al-Malaikah-the Angels. It is a small\\nwindow in the Eastern wall of the Mosque; we turned our backs upon it,\\nand fronting the Hujrah, recited the following prayer:-\\n</p><p>\"Peace be upon You, O Angels of Allah, the Mukarrabin (cherubs), and\\nthe Musharrifin (seraphs), the pure, the holy, honored by the Dwellers\\nin Heaven, and by those who abide upon the Earth. O beneficent Lord! O\\nLong-suffering! O Almighty! O Pitier! O thou Compassionate One! perfect\\nour Light, and pardon our Sins, and accept Penitence for our Offences,\\nand cause us to die among the Holy! Peace be upon Ye, Angels of the\\nMerciful, one and all! And the Mercy of God and His Blessings be upon\\nYou!\" After which I was shown the spot in the Hujrah where Sayyidna Isa\\nshall be buried[FN#54] by Mohammed\\'s side.\\n</p><p>[p.327] Then turning towards the West, at a point where there is a\\nbreak in the symmetry of the Hujrah, we arrived at the sixth station,\\nthe sepulchre or cenotaph of the Lady Fatimah. Her grave is outside the\\nenceinte and the curtain which surrounds her father\\'s remains; so\\nstrict is Moslem decorum, and so exalted its opinion of the\\n\"Virgin\\'s\"[FN#55] delicacy. The Eastern side of the Hujrah, here\\nturning a little Westward, interrupts the shape of the square, in order\\nto give this spot the appearance of disconnection with the rest of the\\nbuilding. The tomb, seen through a square aperture like those above\\ndescribed, is a long catafalque, covered with a black pall. Though\\nthere is great doubt whether the Lady be not buried with her son Hassan\\nin the Bakia cemetery, this place is always visited by the pious\\nMoslem. The following is the prayer opposite the grave of the amiable\\nFatimah:-\\n</p><p>\"Peace be upon Thee, Daughter of the Apostle of Allah! Peace be upon\\nThee, Daughter of the Prophet of Allah! Peace be upon Thee, thou\\nDaughter of Mustafa! Peace be upon Thee, thou Mother of the\\nShurafa![FN#56] (seed of Mohammed.) Peace be upon Thee, O Lady amongst\\nWomen! Peace be upon Thee, O fifth of the Ahl al-Kisa![FN#57] Peace be\\nupon Thee, O Zahra and Batul![FN#58] (Pure and Virgin).\\n</p><p>[p.328] Peace be upon Thee, O Daughter of the Apostle! Peace be upon\\nThee, O Spouse of our Lord Ali al-Murtaza! Peace be upon Thee, O Mother\\nof Hasan and Husayn, the two Moons, the two Lights, the two Pearls, the\\ntwo Princes of the Youth of Heaven, and Coolness of the Eyes[FN#59]\\n(i.e. joy and gladness) of true Believers! Peace be upon Thee, and upon\\nThy Sire, Al-Mustafa, and Thy Husband, our Lord Ali! Allah honour his\\nFace, and Thy Face, and Thy Father\\'s Face in Paradise, and Thy two\\nSons, the Hasanayn! And the Mercy of Allah and His Blessings!\"\\n</p><p>We then broke away as we best could from the crowd of female \"askers,\"\\nwho have established their Lares and Penates under the shadow of the\\nLady\\'s wing; and, advancing a few paces, we fronted to the North, and\\nrecited a prayer in honour of Hamzah, and of the martyrs who lie buried\\nat the foot of Mount Ohod.[FN#60] We then turned to the right, and,\\nfronting the Easterly wall, prayed for the souls of the blessed whose\\nmortal spirits repose within Al-Bakia\\'s hallowed circuit.[FN#61]\\n</p><p>After this we returned to the Southern wall of the Mosque, and, facing\\ntowards Meccah, we recited the following supplication:-\"O Allah! (three\\ntimes repeated) O Compassionate! O Beneficent! O Requiter (of good and\\n</p><p>[p.329] evil)! O Prince! O Ruler! O ancient of Benefits! O Omniscient!\\nO Thou who givest when asked, and who aidest when Aid is required,\\naccept this our Visitation, and preserve us from Dangers, and make easy\\nour Affairs, and broaden our Breasts, (gladden our hearts), and receive\\nour Prostration, and requite us according to our good Deeds, and turn\\nnot against us our evil Deeds, and place not over us one who feareth\\nnot Thee, and one who pitieth not us, and write Safety and Health upon\\nus and upon Thy Slaves, the Hujjaj (pilgrims), and the Ghuzzat\\n(fighters for the faith), and the Zawwar[FN#62] (visitors to the tomb),\\nand the Home-dwellers and the Wayfarers of the Moslems, by Land and by\\nSea, and pardon those of the Faith of our Lord Mohammed One and All!\"\\n</p><p>&gt;From the Southern wall we returned to the \"Apostle\\'s Window,\" where we\\nrecited the following tetrastich and prayer:-\\n</p><p>\"O Mustafa! verily, I stand at Thy door,\\nA man, weak and fearful, by reason of my sins:\\nIf Thou aid me not, O Apostle of Allah!\\nI die-for, in the world there is none generous as Thou art!\"\\n</p><p>\"Of a Truth, Allah and His Angels bless the Apostle! O Ye who believe,\\nbless Him and salute Him with salutation![FN#63] O Allah! verily I\\nimplore Thy Pardon and supplicate Thine Aid in this World as in the\\nnext! O Allah! O Allah! abandon us not in this Holy Place to the\\nconsequences of our Sins without pardoning them, or to our Griefs\\nwithout consoling them, or to our Fears, O Allah! without removing\\nthem. And Blessings and Salutation to Thee, O Prince of Apostles,\\nCommissioned (to preach the word), and laud be to Allah, the Lord of\\nthe (three) Worlds!\"\\n</p><p>We turned away from the Hujrah, and after gratifying\\n</p><p>[p.330] a meek-looking but exceedingly importunate Hindi beggar, who\\ninsisted on stunning me with the Chapter Y, S.,[FN#64] we fronted\\nSouthwards, and taking care that our backs should not be in a line with\\nthe Apostle\\'s face, stood opposite the niche called Mihrab Osman. There\\nHamid proceeded with another supplication. \"O Allah! (three times\\nrepeated), O Safeguard of the Fearful, and Defender of those who trust\\nin Thee, and Pitier of the Weak, the Poor, and the Destitute! accept\\nus, O Beneficent! and pardon us, O Merciful! and receive our Penitence,\\nO Compassionate! and have Mercy upon us, O Forgiver!-for verily none\\nbut Thou canst remit Sin! Of a Truth Thou alone knowest the hidden, and\\nveilest Man\\'s Transgressions: veil, then, our Offences, and pardon our\\nSins, and broaden our Breasts, and cause our last Words at the Supreme\\nHour of Life to be the Words, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdThere is no god but Allah,[FN#65] and\\nour Lord Mohammed is the Apostle of Allah!\\' O Allah! cause us to live\\naccording to this Saying, O thou Giver of life; and make us to die in\\nthis Faith, O thou Ruler of Death! And the best of Blessings and the\\ncompletest of Salutations upon the sole Lord of Intercession, our Lord\\nMohammed and His Family, and His Companions One and All!\"\\n</p><p>Lastly, we returned to the Garden,[FN#66] and prayed another two-bow\\nprayer, ending, as we began, with the worship of the Creator.\\n</p><p>[p.331] Unfortunately for me, the boy Mohammed had donned that grand\\nembroidered coat. At the end of the ceremony the Aghas, or eunuchs of\\nthe Mosque, a race of men considered respectable by their office, and\\nprone to make themselves respected by the freest administration of\\nclub-law, assembled in Al-Rauzah to offer me the congratulation\\nZiyaratak Mubarak-\"Blessed be thy Visitation,\"-and to demand fees. Then\\ncame the Sakka, or water-carrier of the Mosque well, Zemzem,[FN#67]\\noffering a tinned saucer filled from the holy source. And lastly I was\\nbeset by beggars.\\n</p><p>Some were mild beggars and picturesque, who sat upon the ground\\nimmersed in the contemplation of their napkins; others, angry beggars\\nwho cursed if they were not gratified; and others noisy and petulant\\nbeggars, especially the feminine party near the Lady\\'s tomb, who\\ncaptured me by the skirt of my garment, compelling me to ransom myself.\\nThere were, besides, pretty beggars, boys who held out the right hand\\non the score of good looks; ugly beggars, emaciated rascals whose long\\nhair, dirt, and leanness entitled them to charity; and lastly, the\\nblind, the halt, and the diseased, who, as Sons of the Holy City,\\ndemanded from the Faithful that support with which they could not\\nprovide themselves. Having been compelled by my companions, highly\\nagainst my inclination, to become a man of rank, I was obliged to pay\\nin proportion, and my almoner in the handsome coat, as usual, took a\\nkind of pride in being profuse. This first visit cost me double what I\\nhad intended-four dollars-nearly one pound sterling, and never\\nafterwards could I pay less than half that sum.[FN#68]\\n</p><p>[p.332] Having now performed all the duties of a good Zair, I was\\npermitted by Shaykh Hamid to wander about and see the sights. We began\\nour circumambulation at the Bab al-Salam,[FN#69] the Gate of Salvation,\\nthe South-Western entrance pierced in the long wall of the Mosque. It\\nis a fine archway handsomely encrusted with marble and glazed tiles;\\nthe many gilt inscriptions on its sides give it, especially at\\nnight-time, an appearance of considerable splendour. The\\nportcullis-like doors are of wood, strengthened with brass plates, and\\nnails of the same metal. Outside this gate is a little Sabil, or public\\nfountain, where those who will not pay for the water, kept ready in\\nlarge earthen jars by the \"Sakka\" of the Mosque, perform their\\nablutions gratis. Here all the mendicants congregate in force, sitting\\non the outer steps and at the entrance of the Mosque, up and through\\nwhich the visitors must pass.\\n</p><p>About the centre of the Western wall is the Bab alRahmah, the Gate of\\nPity, which admits the dead bodies of the Faithful when carried to be\\nprayed over in the Mosque. There is nothing remarkable in its\\nappearance; in common with the other gates it has huge folding doors,\\niron-bound, an external flight of steps, and a few modern inscriptions.\\n</p><p>The Bab Majidi, or Gate of the Sultan Abd al-Majid, stands in the\\ncentre of the Northern wall; like its portico, it is unfinished, but\\nits present appearance promises that it will eclipse all except the Bab\\nal-Salam.\\n</p><p>The Bab al-Nisa, or Gate of Women, is in the Eastern wall opposite the\\nBab al-Rahmah, with which it is connected by the \"Farsh al-Hajar,\" a\\nbroad band of stone, two or three steps below the level of the portico,\\n</p><p>[p.333] and slightly raised above the Sahn or the hypaethral portion of\\nthe Mosque. And lastly, in the Southern portion of the same Eastern\\nwall is the Bab Jibrail, the Gate of the Archangel Gabriel.[FN#70]\\n</p><p>All these entrances are arrived at by short external flights of steps\\nleading from the streets, as the base of the temple, unlike that of\\nMeccah, is a little higher than the foundation of the buildings around\\nit. The doors are closed by the attendant eunuchs immediately after the\\nnight prayers, except during the blessed month Al-Ramazan and in the\\npilgrimage season, when pious visitors pay considerable fees there to\\npass the night in meditation and prayer.\\n</p><p>The minarets are five in number; but one, the Shikayliyah, at the\\nNorth-West angle of the building, has been levelled, and is still in\\nprocess of being rebuilt. The Munar Bab al-Salam stands by the gate of\\nthat name: it is a tall, handsome tower, surmounted by a large ball or\\ncone[FN#71] of brass gilt or burnished. The Munar Bab al-Rahmah, about\\nthe centre of the Western wall, is of more simple form than the others:\\nit has two galleries, with the superior portion circular, and\\nsurmounted by the conical \"extinguisher\"-roof so common in Turkey and\\nEgypt. On the North-East angle of the Mosque stands the Sulaymaniyah\\nMunar, so named after its founder, Sultan Sulayman the Magnificent. It\\nis a well-built and substantial stone-tower divided into three stages;\\nthe two\\n</p><p>[p.334] lower portions are polygonal, the upper cylindrical, and each\\nterminates in a platform with a railed gallery carried all round for\\nthe protection of those who ascend.\\n</p><p>And lastly, from the South-East angle of the Mosque, supposed to be\\nupon the spot where Belal, the Apostle\\'s loud-lunged crier, called the\\nfirst Moslems to prayer,\\n[FN#72] springs the Munar Raisiyah, so called because it is\\nappropriated to the Ruasa or chiefs of the Mu\\'ezzins. Like the\\nSulaymaniyah, it consists of three parts: the first and second stages\\nare polygonal; and the third, a cylinder, is furnished like the lower\\ntwo with a railed gallery. Both the latter minarets end in solid ovals\\nof masonry, from which project a number of wooden triangles. To these\\nand to the galleries on all festive occasions, such as the arrival of\\nthe Damascus caravan, are hung oil-lamps-a poor attempt at\\nillumination, which may rationally explain the origin of the Madinite\\nsuperstition concerning the column of light which crowns the Prophet\\'s\\ntomb. There is no uniformity in the shape or the size of these four\\nminarets, and at first sight, despite their beauty and grandeur, they\\nappear somewhat bizarre and misplaced. But after a few days I found\\nthat my eye grew accustomed to them, and I had no difficulty in\\nappreciating their massive proportions and lofty forms.\\n</p><p>Equally irregular are the Riwaks, or porches, surrounding the\\nhypaethral court. Along the Northern wall there will be, when finished,\\na fine colonnade of granite, paved with marble. The Eastern Riwak has\\nthree rows of pillars, the Western four, and the Southern, under which\\nstands the tomb, of course has its columns ranged deeper than all the\\nothers. These supports of the building are of different material; some\\nof fine marble, others of\\n</p><p>[p.335] rough stone, plastered over and painted with the most vulgar of\\narabesques,-vermilion and black in irregular patches and broad streaks,\\nlike the stage-face of a London clown.[FN#73] Their size, moreover, is\\ndifferent, the Southern colonnade being composed of pillars palpably\\nlarger than those in the other parts of the Mosque. Scarcely any two\\nshafts own similar capitals; many have no pedestal, and some of them\\nare cut with a painful ignorance of art. I cannot extend my admiration\\nof the minarets to the columns-in their \"architectural lawlessness\"\\nthere is not a redeeming point.\\n</p><p>Of these unpraisable pillars three are celebrated in the annals of\\nAl-Islam, for which reason their names are painted upon them, and five\\nothers enjoy the honour of distinctive appellations. The first is\\ncalled Al-Mukhallak, because, on some occasion of impurity, it was\\nanointed with a perfume called Khaluk. It is near the Mihrab al-Nabawi,\\non the right of the place where the Imam prays; and it notes the spot\\nwhere, before the invention of the Pulpit, the Apostle, leaning upon\\nthe Ustuwanat al-Hannanah-the Weeping Pillar[FN#74]-used to recite the\\nKhutbah or Friday sermon.\\n</p><p>The second stands third from the Pulpit, and third from the Hujrah. It\\nis called the Pillar of Ayishah, also the Ustuwanat al-Kurah, or the\\nColumn of Lots, because the Apostle, according to the testimony of his\\nfavourite wife, declared that if men knew the value of the place, they\\nwould cast lots to pray there: in some books it is known as the Pillar\\nof the Muhajirin or Fugitives, and others mention it as\\nAl-Mukhallak-the Perfumed.\\n</p><p>Twenty cubits distant from Ayishah\\'s Pillar, and the second from the Hujrah, and the fourth from the Pulpit, is the\\nPillar of Repentance, or of Abu Lubabah. It derives its name from the\\nfollowing circumstance. Abu Lubabah was a native of Al-Madinah, one of\\nthe Auxiliaries and a companion of Mohammed, originally it is said a\\nJew, according to others of the Beni Amr bin Auf of the Aus tribe.\\nBeing sent for by his kinsmen or his allies, the Benu Kurayzah, at that\\ntime capitulating to Mohammed, he was consulted by the distracted men,\\nwomen, and children, who threw themselves at his feet, and begged of\\nhim to intercede for them with the offended Apostle. Abu Lubabah swore\\nhe would do so: at the same time, he drew his hand across his throat,\\nas much as to say, \"Defend yourselves to the last, for if you yield,\\nsuch is your doom.\" Afterwards repenting, he bound himself with a huge\\nchain to the date-tree in whose place the column now stands, vowing to\\ncontinue there until Allah and the Apostle accepted his penitence-a\\ncircumstance which did not take place till the tenth day, when his\\nhearing was gone and he had almost lost his sight.\\n</p><p>The less celebrated pillars are the Ustuwanat al-Sarir, or Column of\\nthe Cot, where the Apostle was wont to sit meditating on his humble\\ncouch-frame of date-sticks. The Ustuwanat Ali notes the spot where the\\nfourth Caliph used to pray and watch near his father-in-law at night.\\nAt the Ustuwanat al-Wufud, as its name denotes, the Apostle received\\nenvoys, couriers, and emissaries from foreign places. The Ustuwanat\\nal-Tahajjud now stands where Mohammed, sitting upon his mat, passed the\\nnight in prayer. And lastly is the Makam Jibrail (Gabriel\\'s place), for\\nwhose other name, Mirbaat al-Bair, \"the Pole of the Beast of Burden,\" I\\nhave been unable to find an explanation.\\n</p><p>The four Riwaks, or porches, of the Madinah Mosque open upon a\\nhypaethral court of parallelogramic shape.\\n</p><p>[p.337] The only remarkable object in it[FN#75] is a square of wooden\\nrailing enclosing a place full of well-watered earth, called the Garden\\nof our Lady Fatimah.[FN#76] It now contains a dozen date-trees-in Ibn\\nJubayr\\'s time there were fifteen. Their fruit is sent by the eunuchs as\\npresents to the Sultan and the great men of Al-Islam; it is highly\\nvalued by the vulgar, but the Olema do not think much of its claims to\\nimportance. Among the palms are the venerable remains of a Sidr, or\\nLote tree,[FN#77] whose produce is sold for inordinate sums. The\\nenclosure is entered by a dwarf gate in the South-Eastern portion of\\nthe railing, near the well, and one of the eunuchs is generally to be\\nseen in it: it is under the charge of the Mudir, or chief treasurer.\\nThese gardens are not uncommon in Mosques, as the traveller who passes\\nthrough Cairo can convince himself. They form a pretty and an\\nappropriate feature in a building erected for the worship of Him \"Who\\nspread the Earth with Carpets of Flowers and drew shady Trees from the\\ndead Ground.\" A tradition of the Apostle also declares that \"Acceptable\\nis Devotion in the Garden and in the Orchard.\"\\n</p><p>[p.338] At the South-East angle of this enclosure, under a wooden roof\\nsupported by pillars of the same material, stands the Zemzem, generally\\ncalled the Bir al-Nabi, or \"the Apostle\\'s well.\" My predecessor\\ndeclares that the brackishness of its produce has stood in the way of\\nits reputation for holiness. Yet a well-educated man told me that it\\nwas as \"light\" (wholesome) water[FN#78] as any in Al-Madinah,-a fact\\nwhich he accounted for by supposing a subterraneous passage[FN#79]\\nwhich connects it with the great Zemzem at Meccah. Others, again,\\nbelieve that it is filled by a vein of water springing directly under\\nthe Apostle\\'s grave: generally, however, among the learned it is not\\nmore revered than our Lady\\'s Garden, nor is it ranked in books among\\nthe holy wells of Al-Madinah.\\n</p><p>Between this <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well_of_Zamzam\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"w:Well of Zamzam\">Zemzem well</a> and the Eastern Riwak is the Stoa, or\\nAcademia, of the Prophet\\'s city. In the cool mornings and evenings the\\nground is strewed with professors, who teach the young idea, as an\\neminent orientalist hath it, to shout rather than to shoot.[FN#80] A\\nfew feet to the South of the palm garden is a moveable wooden planking\\npainted green, and about three feet high; it serves to separate the\\ncongregation from the Imam when he prays here; and at the North-Eastern\\nangle of the enclosure is a\\n</p><p>[p.339] Shajar Kanadil, a large brass chandelier, which completes the\\nfurniture of the court.\\n</p><p>After this inspection, the shadows of evening began to gather round us.\\nWe left the Mosque, reverently taking care to issue forth with the left\\nfoot, and not to back out of it as is the Sunnat or practice derived\\nfrom the Apostle, when taking leave of the Meccan Temple.\\n</p><p>To conclude this long chapter. Although every Moslem, learned and\\nsimple, firmly believes that Mohammed\\'s remains are interred in the\\nHujrah at Al-Madinah, I cannot help suspecting that the place is\\ndoubtful as that of the Holy Sepulchre at Jerusalem. It must be\\nremembered that a tumult followed the announcement of the Apostle\\'s\\ndeath, when the people, as often happens, believing him to be\\nimmortal,[FN#81] refused to credit the report, and even Omar threatened\\ndestruction to any one that asserted it.\\n</p><p>Moreover the body was scarcely cold when the contest about the\\nsuccession arose between the fugitives of Meccah and the auxiliaries of\\nAl-Madinah: in the ardour of which, according to the Shi\\'ahs, the house\\nof Ali and Fatimah-within a few feet of the spot where the tomb of the\\nApostle is now placed-was threatened with fire, and Abu Bakr was\\nelected Caliph that same evening. If anyone find cause to wonder that\\nthe last resting-place of a personage so important was not fixed for\\never, he may find many a parallel case in Al-Madinah. To quote no\\nother, three several localities claim the honour of containing the Lady\\nFatimah\\'s mortal spoils, although one might suppose that the daughter\\nof the Apostle and the mother of the Imams would not be laid in an\\nunknown grave. My reasons for incredulity are the following:\\n[p.340] From the earliest days the shape of the Apostle\\'s tomb has\\nnever been generally known in Al-Islam. For this reason it is that\\ngraves are made convex in some countries, and flat in others. Had there\\nbeen a Sunnat,[FN#82] such would not have been the case.\\n</p><p>The accounts of the learned are discrepant. Al-Samanhudi, perhaps the\\nhighest authority, contradicts himself. In one place he describes the\\ncoffin; in another he expressly declares that he entered the Hujrah\\nwhen it was being repaired by Kaid-Bey, and saw in the inside three\\ndeep graves, but no traces of tombs.[FN#83] Either, then, the mortal\\nremains of the Apostle had, despite Moslem superstition,[FN#84] mingled\\nwith the dust, (a probable circumstance\\n</p><p>[p.341] after nearly nine hundred years\\' interment), or, what is more\\nlikely, they had been removed by the Shi\\'ah schismatics who for\\ncenturies had charge of the sepulchre.[FN#85]\\n</p><p>And lastly, I cannot but look upon the tale of the blinding light which\\nsurrounds the Apostle\\'s tomb, current for ages past and still\\nuniversally believed upon the authority of the attendant eunuchs, who\\nmust know its falsehood, as a priestly gloss intended to conceal a\\ndefect.\\n</p><p>I here conclude the subject, committing it to some future and more\\nfavoured investigator. In offering the above remarks, I am far from\\nwishing to throw a doubt upon an established point of history. But\\nwhere a suspicion of fable arises from popular \"facts,\" a knowledge of\\nman and of his manners teaches us to regard it with favouring\\neye.[FN#86]\\n</p><p>[FN#1] Others add a fourth, namely, the Masjid al-Takwa, at Kuba.\\n[FN#2] The Moslem divines, however, na\\xef\\xbf\\xbdvely remind their readers, that\\nthey are not to pray once in the Al-Madinah Mosque, and neglect the\\nother 999, as if absolved from the necessity of them. The passage in\\nthe text merely promises 1000 blessings upon that man\\'s devotion who\\nprays at the Prophet\\'s Mosque.\\n[FN#3] The visitor, who approaches the Sepulchre as a matter of\\nreligious ceremony, is called \"Zair,\" his conductor \"Muzawwir,\" whereas\\nthe pilgrim at Meccah becomes a \"Haji.\" The Imam Malik disapproved of a\\nMoslem\\'s saying, \"I have visited the Prophet\\'s tomb,\" preferring him to\\nexpress himself thus-\"I have visited the Prophet.\" Others again dislike\\nthe latter formula, declaring the Prophet too venerable to be so\\nvisited by Amr and Zayd.\\n[FN#4] In A.D. 1807, they prevented Ali Bey (the Spaniard Badia) from\\nentering Al-Madinah, and it appears that he had reason to congratulate\\nhimself upon escaping without severe punishment.\\n[FN#5] Nothing in the Spanish cathedrals suggests their oriental origin\\nand the taste of the people, more than the way in which they are hedged\\nin by secular buildings.\\n[FN#6] The ceremony of Ziyarat, however, begins at the Bab al-Salam. We\\nrode up to this gate only in order to avoid the sun.\\n[FN#7] Haswah is a place covered with gravel: Ramlah, one which is\\nsanded over. Both are equally applicable, and applied to the areas of\\nMosques. Al-Sahn is the general word; Al-Hosh is occasionally used, but\\nis more properly applied to the court-yard of a dwelling-house.\\n[FN#8] This Riwak was begun about five or six years ago by Abd\\nal-Majid. To judge from the size of the columns, and the other\\npreparations which encumber the ground, this part of the building will\\nsurpass all the rest. But the people of Al-Madinah assured me that it\\nwill not be finished for some time,-a prophecy likely to be fulfilled\\nby the present state of Turkish finance.\\n[FN#9] This gate derives its peculiar name from its vicinity to the\\nLady Fatimah\\'s tomb; women, when they do visit the Mosque, enter it\\nthrough all the doors indifferently.\\n[FN#10] It is so called by the figure synecdoche: it contains the\\nRauzah or the Prophet\\'s Garden, and therefore the whole portico enjoys\\nthat honoured name.\\n[FN#11] These carpets are swept by the eunuchs, who let out the office\\nfor a certain fee to pilgrims, every morning, immediately after\\nsunrise. Their diligence, however, does by no means prevent the\\npresence of certain little parasites, concerning which politeness is\\ndumb\\n[FN#12] Because if not pure, ablution is performed at the well in the\\ncentre of the hypaethra. Zairs are ordered to visit the Mosque\\nperfumed, and in their best clothes, and the Hanafi school deems it\\nlawful on this occasion only to wear dresses of pure silk.\\n[FN#13] In this Mosque, as in all others, it is proper to enter with\\nthe right foot, and to retire with the left.\\n[FN#14] I must warn the reader that almost every Muzawwir has his own\\nlitany, which descends from father to son: moreover, all the books\\ndiffer at least as much as do the oral authorities.\\n[FN#15] That is to say, \"over the world, the flesh, and the devil.\"\\n[FN#16] This by strangers is called the Masalla Shafe\\'i, or the Place\\nof Prayer of the Shafe\\'i school. It was sent from Constantinople about\\n100 years ago, by Sultan Sulayman the Magnificent. He built the\\nSulaymaniyah minaret, and has immortalised his name at Al-Madinah, as\\nwell as at Meccah, by the number of his donations to the shrine.\\n[FN#17] Here is supposed to have been one of the Prophet\\'s favourite\\nstations of prayer. It is commonly called the Musalla Hanafi, because\\nnow appropriated by that school.\\n[FN#18] This tradition, like most others referring to events posterior\\nto the Prophet\\'s death, is differently given, and so important are the\\nvariations, that I only admire how all Al-Islam does not follow Wahhabi\\nexample, and summarily consign them to oblivion. Some read \"Between my\\ndwelling-house (in the Mosque) and my place of Prayer (in the Barr\\nal-Manakhah) is a Garden of the Gardens of Paradise.\" Others again,\\n\"Between my house and my pulpit is a Garden of the Gardens of\\nParadise.\" A third tradition-\"Between my tomb and my pulpit is a Garden\\nof the Gardens of Paradise, and verily my pulpit is in my Full\\nCistern,\" or \"upon a Full Cistern of the Cisterns of Paradise,\" has\\ngiven rise to a new superstition. \"Tara,\" according to some\\ncommentators, alludes especially to the cistern Al-Kausar; consequently\\nthis Rauzah is, like the black stone at Meccah, bona fide, a bit of\\nParadise, and on the day of resurrection, it shall return bodily to the\\nplace whence it came. Be this as it may, all Moslems are warned that\\nthe Rauzah is a most holy spot. None but the Prophet and his son-in-law\\nAli ever entered it, when ceremonially impure, without being guilty of\\ndeadly sin. The Mohammedan of the present day is especially informed\\nthat on no account must he here tell lies, or even perjure himself.\\nThus the Rauzah must be respected as much as the interior of the Bayt\\nAllah at Meccah.\\n[FN#19] This is a stone desk on four pillars, where the Muballighs (or\\nclerks) recite the Ikamah, the call to divine service. It was presented\\nto the Mosque by Kaid-Bey, the Mamluk Sultan of Egypt.\\n[FN#20] I shall have something to say about this pulpit when entering\\ninto the history of the Harim.\\n[FN#21] The afternoon prayers being Farz, or obligatory, were recited,\\nbecause we feared that evening might come on before the ceremony of\\nZiyarat (visitation) concluded, and thus the time for Al-Asr (afternoon\\nprayers) might pass away. The reader may think this rather a curious\\nforethought in a man who, like Hamid, never prayed except when he found\\nthe case urgent. Such, however, is the strict order, and my Muzawwir\\nwas right to see it executed.\\n[FN#22]. This two-bow prayer, which generally is recited in honour of\\nthe Mosque, is here, say divines, addressed especially to the Deity by\\nthe visitor who intends to beg the intercession of his Prophet. It is\\nonly just to confess that the Moslems have done their best by all means\\nin human power, here as well as elsewhere, to inculcate the doctrine of\\neternal distinction between the creature and the Creator. Many of the\\nMaliki school, however, make the ceremony of Ziyarat to precede the\\nprayer to the Deity.\\n[FN#23] The Sujdah is a single \"prostration\" with the forehead touching\\nthe ground. It is performed from a sitting position, after the Dua or\\nsupplication that concludes the two-bow prayer. Some of the Olema,\\nespecially those of the Shafe\\'i school, permit this \"Sujdah of thanks\"\\nto be performed before the two-bow prayer if the visitor have any\\nnotable reason to be grateful.\\n[FN#24] The candles are still sent from Cairo.\\n[FN#25] These windows are a present from Kaid-Bey, the Mamluk Sultan of\\nEgypt.\\n[FN#26] These oil lamps are a present from the Sultan.\\n[FN#27] The five daily liturgies are here recited by Imams, and every\\none presses to the spot on account of its peculiar sanctity.\\n[FN#28] In Moslem theology \"Salat\" from Allah means mercy, from the\\nangels intercession for pardon, and from mankind blessing. The act of\\nblessing the Prophet is one of peculiar efficacy in a religious point\\nof view. Cases are quoted of sinners being actually snatched from hell\\nby a glorious figure, the personification of the blessings which had\\nbeen called down by them upon Mohammed\\'s head. This most poetical idea\\nis borrowed, I believe, from the ancient Guebres, who fabled that a\\nman\\'s good works assumed a beautiful female shape, which stood to meet\\nhis soul when winding its way to judgment. Also when a Moslem blesses\\nMohammed at Al-Madinah, his sins are not written down for three\\ndays,-thus allowing ample margin for repentance,-by the recording\\nangel. Al-Malakayn (the two Angels), or Kiram al-Katibin (the Generous\\nWriters), are mere personifications of the good principle and the evil\\nprinciple of man\\'s nature; they are fabled to occupy each a shoulder,\\nand to keep a list of words and deeds. This is certainly borrowed from\\na more ancient faith. In Hermas II. (command. 6), we are told that\\n\"every man has two angels, one of godliness, the other of iniquity,\"\\nwho endeavour to secure his allegiance,-a superstition seemingly\\nfounded upon the dualism of the old Persians. Mediaeval Europe, which\\nborrowed so much from the East at the time of the Crusades, degraded\\nthese angels into good and bad fairies for children\\'s stories.\\n[FN#29] Burckhardt writes this word Hedjra (which means \"flight\"). Nor\\nis M. Caussin de Perceval\\'s \"El Hadjarat\" less erroneous. At Madinah it\\nis invariably called Al-Hujrah-the chamber. The chief difficulty in\\ndistinguishing the two words, meaning \"chamber\" and \"flight,\" arises\\nfrom our only having one h to represent the hard and soft h of Arabic,\\n???? [Arabic text] and&#160;???? [Arabic text]. In the case of common\\nsaints, the screen or railing round the cenotaph is called a \"Maksurah.\"\\n[FN#30] Yet Mohammed enjoined his followers to frequent graveyards.\\n\"Visit graves; of a verity they shall make you think of futurity!\" And\\nagain, \"Whoso visiteth his two parents\\' grave, or one of the two, every\\nFriday, he shall be written a pious child, even though he might have\\nbeen in the world, before that, a disobedient.\"\\n[FN#31] The truth is no one knows what is there. I have even heard a\\nlearned Persian declare that there is no wall behind the curtain, which\\nhangs so loosely that, when the wind blows against it, it defines the\\nform of a block of marble, or a built-up tomb. I believe this to be\\nwholly apocryphal, for reasons which will presently be offered.\\n[FN#32] The peculiar place where the guardians of the tomb sit and\\nconfabulate is the Dakkat al-Aghawat (eunuch\\'s bench) or Al-Mayda-the\\ntable-a raised bench of stone and wood, on the North side of the\\nHujrah. The remaining part of this side is partitioned off from the\\nbody of the Mosque by a dwarf wall, inclosing the \"Khasafat al-Sultan,\"\\nthe place where Fakihs are perpetually engaged in Khitmahs, or perusals\\nof the Koran, on behalf of the reigning Sultan.\\n[FN#33] The ancient practice of Al-Islam during the recitation of the\\nfollowing benedictions was to face Meccah, the back being turned\\ntowards the tomb, and to form a mental image of the Prophet, supposing\\nhim to be in front. Al-Kirmani and other doctors prefer this as the\\nmore venerable custom, but in these days it is completely exploded, and\\nthe purist would probably be soundly bastinadoed by the eunuchs for\\nattempting it.\\n[FN#34] This is the usual introduction to a quotation from the Koran.\\n[FN#35] It may easily be conceived how offensive this must be to the\\nWahhabis, who consider it blasphemy to assert that a mere man can stand\\nbetween the Creator and the creature on the last day.\\n[FN#36] This is called the Testification. Like the Fatihah, it is\\nrepeated at every holy place and tomb visited at Al-Madinah.\\n[FN#37] Burckhardt mentions that in his day, among other favours\\nsupplicated in prayer to the Deity, the following request was\\nmade,-\"Destroy our enemies, and may the torments of hell-fire be their\\nlot!\" I never heard it at the Prophet\\'s tomb. As the above benediction\\nis rather a long one, the Zair is allowed to shorten it a discretion,\\nbut on no account to say less than \"Peace be upon Thee, O Apostle of\\nAllah\"-this being the gist of the ceremony.\\n[FN#38] Though performing Ziyarat for myself, I had promised my old\\nShaykh at Cairo to recite a Fatihah in his name at the Prophet\\'s tomb;\\nso a double recitation fell to my lot. If acting Zair for another\\nperson (a common custom, we read, even in the days of Al-Walid, the\\nCaliph of Damascus), you are bound to mention your principal\\'s name at\\nthe beginning of the benediction, thus: \"Peace be upon Thee, O Apostle\\nof Allah from such an one, the son of such an one, who wants Thine\\nIntercession, and begs for Pardon and Mercy.\" Most Zairs recite\\nFatihahs for all their friends and relations at the tomb.\\n[FN#39] I have endeavoured in this translation to imitate the imperfect\\nrhyme of the original Arabic. Such an attempt, however, is full of\\ndifficulties: the Arabic is a language in which, like Italian, it is\\nalmost impossible not to rhyme.\\n[FN#40] It will not be necessary to inform the reader more than once\\nthat all these several divisions of prayer ended with the Testification\\nand the Fatihah.\\n[FN#41] Faruk,-the separator,-a title of Omar.\\n[FN#42] When the number of the Ashab or \"Companions\" was thirty-nine,\\nthey were suddenly joined by Omar, who thus became the fortieth.\\n[FN#43] It is said that Mohammed prayed long for the conversion of Omar\\nto Al-Islam, knowing his sterling qualities, and the aid he would lend\\nto the establishment of the faith.\\n[FN#44] This foolish fanaticism has lost many an innocent life, for the\\nArabs on these occasions seize their sabres, and cut down every Persian\\nthey meet. Still, bigoted Shi\\'ahs persist in practising and applauding\\nit, and the man who can boast at Shiraz of having defiled Abu Bakr\\'s,\\nOmar\\'s, or Osman\\'s tomb becomes at once a lion and a hero. I suspect\\nthat on some occasions when the people of Al-Madinah are anxious for an\\n\"avanie,\" they get up some charge of the kind against the Persians. So\\nthe Meccans have sometimes found these people guilty of defiling the\\nhouse of Allah-at which Infidel act a Shi\\'ah would shudder as much as a\\nSunni. This style of sacrilege is, we read, of ancient date in Arabia.\\nNafil, the Hijazi, polluted the Kilis (Christian church) erected by\\nAbrahah of Sanaa to outshine the Ka\\'abah, and draw off worshippers from\\nMeccah. The outrage caused the celebrated \"affair of the Elephant.\"\\n(See D\\'Herbelot, Bibl. Or., v. \"Abrahah.\")\\n[FN#45] Burckhardt, with his usual accuracy, asserts that a new curtain\\nis sent when the old one is decayed, or when a new Sultan ascends the\\nthrone, and those authors err who, like Maundrell, declare the curtain\\nto be removed every year. The Damascus Caravan conveys, together with\\nits Mahmil or emblem of royalty, the new Kiswah (or \"garment\") when\\nrequired for the tomb. It is put on by the eunuchs, who enter the\\nbaldaquin by its Northern gate at night time, and there is a\\nsuperstitious story amongst the people that they guard their eyes with\\nveils against the supernatural splendours which pour from the tomb. The\\nKiswah is a black, purple, or green brocade, embroidered with white or\\nwith silver letters. A piece in my possession, the gift of Omar\\nEffendi, is a handsome silk and cotton Damascus brocade, with white\\nletters worked in it-manifestly the produce of manual labour, not the\\npoor dull work of machinery. It contains the formula of the Moslem\\nfaith in the cursive style of the Suls character, seventy-two varieties\\nof which are enumerated by calligraphists. Nothing can be more elegant\\nor appropriate than its appearance. The old curtain is usually\\ndistributed amongst the officers of the Mosque, and sold in bits to\\npilgrims; in some distant Moslem countries, the possessor of such a\\nrelic would be considered a saint. When treating of the history of the\\nMosque, some remarks will be offered about the origin of the curtain.\\n[FN#46] The place of the Prophet\\'s head is, I was told, marked by a\\nfine Koran hung up to the curtain This volume is probably a successor\\nto the relic formerly kept there, the Cufic Koran belonging to Osman,\\nthe fourth Caliph, which Burckhardt supposes to have perished in the\\nconflagration which destroyed the Mosque.\\n[FN#47] The eunuchs of the tomb have the privilege of admitting\\nstrangers. In this passage are preserved the treasures of the place;\\nthey are a \"Bayt Mal al-Muslimin,\" or public treasury of the Moslems;\\ntherefore to be employed by the Caliph (i.e. the reigning Sultan) for\\nthe exigencies of the faith. The amount is said to be enormous, which I\\ndoubt.\\n[FN#48] And I might add, never having seen one who has seen it. Niebuhr\\nis utterly incorrect in his hearsay description of it. It is not\\n\"enclosed within iron railings for fear lest the people might\\nsurreptitiously offer worship to the ashes of the Prophet.\" The tomb is\\nnot \"of plain mason-work in the form of a chest,\" nor does any one\\nbelieve that it is \"placed within or between two other tombs, in which\\nrest the ashes of the first two Caliphs.\" The traveller appears to have\\nlent a credulous ear to the eminent Arab merchant, who told him that a\\nguard was placed over the tomb to prevent the populace scraping dirt\\nfrom about it, and preserving it as a relic.\\n[FN#49] Burckhardt writes this author\\'s name El Samhoudy, and in this\\nhe is followed by all our popular book-makers. Moslems have three ways\\nof spelling it: 1. Al-Samhudi, 2. Al-Samahnudi, and 3. Al-Samanhudi. I\\nprefer the latter, believing that the learned Shaykh, Nur al-Din Ali\\nbin Abdullah al-Hasini (or Al-Husayni) was originally from Samanhud in\\nEgypt, the ancient Sebennitis. He died in A.H. 911, and was buried in\\nthe Bakia cemetery.\\n[FN#50] Burckhardt, however, must be in error when he says \"The tombs\\nare also covered with precious stuffs, and in the shape of catafalques,\\nlike that of Ibrahim in the great Mosque of Meccah.\" The eunuchs\\npositively declare that no one ever approaches the tomb, and that he\\nwho ventured to do so would at once be blinded by the supernatural\\nlight. Moreover the historians of Al-Madinah all quote tales of certain\\nvisions of the Apostle, directing his tomb to be cleared of dust that\\nhad fallen upon it from above, in which case some man celebrated for\\npiety and purity was let through a hole in the roof, by cords, down to\\nthe tomb, with directions to wipe it with his beard. This style of\\ningress is explained by another assertion of Al-Samanhudi, quoted by\\nBurckhardt. \"In A.H. 892, when Kaid-Bey rebuilt the Mosque, which had\\nbeen destroyed by lightning, three deep graves were found in the\\ninside, full of rubbish, but the author of this history, who himself\\nentered it, saw no traces of tombs. The original place of Mohammed\\'s\\ntomb was ascertained with great difficulty; the walls of the Hujrah\\nwere then rebuilt, and the iron railing placed round it, which is now\\nthere.\"\\n[FN#51] Upon this point authors greatly disagree. Ibn Jubayr, for\\ninstance, says that Abu Bakr\\'s head is opposite the Apostle\\'s feet, and\\nthat Omar\\'s face is on a level with Abu Bakr\\'s shoulder.\\n[FN#52] The vulgar story of the suspended coffin has been explained in\\ntwo ways. Niebuhr supposes it to have arisen from the rude drawings\\nsold to strangers. Mr. William Bankes (Giovanni Finati, vol. ii., p.\\n289) believes that the mass of rock popularly described as hanging\\nunsupported in the Mosque of Omar at Jerusalem was confounded by\\nChristians, who could not have seen either of these Moslem shrines,\\nwith the Apostle\\'s Tomb at Al-Madinah.\\n[FN#53] Some Moslems end their Ziyarat at the Apostle\\'s Tomb; others,\\ninstead of advancing, as I did, return to the Apostle\\'s window, pray,\\nand beg pardon for their parents and themselves, and ask all they\\ndesire, concluding with prayers to the Almighty. Thence they repair to\\nthe Rauzah or Garden, and standing at the column called after Abu\\nLubabah, pray a two-bow prayer there; concluding with the \"Dua,\" or\\nbenediction upon the Apostle, and there repeat these words: \"O Allah,\\nThou hast said, and Thy word is true, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdSay, O Lord, pardon and show\\nMercy; for Thou art the best of the Merciful,\\' (chap. 23). O God,\\nverily we have heard Thy Word, and we come for Intercession to Thy\\nApostle from our own Sins, repenting our Errors, and confessing our\\nShortcomings and Transgressions! O Allah, pity us, and by the Dignity\\nof Thy Apostle raise our Place, (in the Heavenly Kingdom)! O Allah,\\npardon our Brothers who have preceded us in the Faith!\" Then the Zair\\nprays for himself, and his parents, and for those he loves. He should\\nrepeat, \"Allah have mercy upon Thee, O Apostle of Allah!\" seventy\\ntimes, when an angel will reply, \"Allah bless thee, O thou blesser.\"\\nThen he should sit before the Pulpit, and mentally conceive in it the\\nApostle surrounded by the Fugitives and the Auxiliaries. Some place the\\nright hand upon the pulpit, even as Mohammed used to do. The Zair then\\nreturns to the column of Abu Lubabah, and repents his sins there.\\nSecondly, he stands in prayer at Ali\\'s Pillar in front of the form.\\nAnd, lastly, he repairs to the Ustuwanat al-Ashab (the Companions\\'\\nColumn) the fourth distant from the Pulpit on the right, and the third\\nfrom the Hujrah on the left; here he prays and meditates, and blesses\\nAllah and the Apostle. After which, he proceeds to visit the rest of\\nthe holy places.\\n[FN#54] It is almost unnecessary to inform the reader that all Moslems\\ndeny the personal suffering of Christ, cleaving to the heresy of the\\nChristian Docetes,-certain \"beasts in the shape of men,\" as they are\\ncalled in the Epistles of Ignatius to the Smyrneans,-who believed that\\na phantom was crucified in our Saviour\\'s place. They also hold to the\\nsecond coming of the Lord in the flesh, as a forerunner to Mohammed,\\nwho shall reappear shortly before the day of judgment. Bartema\\n(Appendix 2) relates a story concerning the Saviour\\'s future tomb.\\n[FN#55] This epithet will be explained below. The reader must bear in\\nmind, that this part of the Harim was formerly the house of Ali and\\nFatimah; it was separated from the Hujrah-the abode of Mohammed and\\nAyishah-only by a narrow brick wall, with a window in it, which was\\nnever shut. Omar Bin Abd al-Aziz enclosed it in the mosque, by order of\\nAl-Walid, A.H. 90.\\n[FN#56] Plural of Sharif, a descendant of Mohammed.\\n[FN#57] The \"people of the garment,\" so called, because on one occasion\\nthe Apostle wrapped his cloak around himself, his daughter, his\\nson-in-law, and his two grandsons, thereby separating them in dignity\\nfrom other Moslems.\\n[FN#58] Burckhardt translates \"Zahra\" \"bright blooming Fatimah.\" This I\\nbelieve to be the literal meaning of the epithet. When thus applied,\\nhowever, it denotes \"virginem [Greek text] nescientem,\" in which state\\nof purity the daughter of the Apostle is supposed to have lived. For\\nthe same reason she is called Al-Batul, the Virgin,-a title given by\\nEastern Christians to the Mother of our Lord. The perpetual virginity\\nof Fatimah, even after the motherhood, is a point of orthodoxy in\\nAl-Islam.\\n[FN#59] Meaning \"joy and gladness in the sight of true believers.\"\\n[FN#60] The prayer is now omitted, in order to avoid the repetition of\\nit when describing a visit to Mount Ohod.\\n[FN#61] The prayers usually recited here are especially in honour of\\nAbbas, Hasan, (Ali, called) Zayn al-Abidin, Osman, the Lady Halimah,\\nthe Martyrs, and the Mothers of the Moslems, (i.e. the Apostle\\'s\\nwives), buried in the holy cemetery. When describing a visit to\\nAl-Bakia, they will be translated at full length.\\n[FN#62] Hujjaj is the plural of Hajj-pilgrims; Ghuzzat, of\\nGhazi-crusaders; and Zawwar of Zair-visitors to Mohammed\\'s tomb.\\n[FN#63] \"Taslim\" is \"to say Salam\" to a person.\\n[FN#64] The Ya Sin (Y, S), the 36th chapter of the Koran, frequently\\nrecited by those whose profession it is to say such masses for the\\nbenefit of living, as well as of dead, sinners. Most educated Moslems\\ncommit it to memory.\\n[FN#65] Or more correctly, \"There is no Ilah but Allah,\" that is,\\n\"There is no god but the God.\"\\n[FN#66] Some Zairs, after praying at the Caliph Osman\\'s niche, leave\\nthe Mosque, especially when the \"Jama\\'at,\" or public worship, is not\\nbeing performed in the Rauzah. Others, as we did, pray alone in the\\nGarden, and many authors prefer this conclusion to Visitation, for the\\nreason above given.\\n[FN#67] This has become a generic name for a Well situated within the\\nwalls of a Mosque.\\n[FN#68] As might be expected, the more a man pays, the higher he\\nestimates his own dignity. Some Indians have spent as much as 500\\ndollars during a first visit. Others have \"made Maulids,\" i.e., feasted\\nall the poor connected with the temple with rice, meat, &amp;c., whilst\\nothers brought rare and expensive presents for the officials. Such\\ngenerosity, however, is becoming rare in these unworthy days.\\n[FN#69] This gate was anciently called the Bab al-Atakah, \"of\\nDeliverance.\"\\n[FN#70] Most of these entrances have been named and renamed. The Bab\\nJibrail, for instance, which derives its present appellation from the\\ngeneral belief that the archangel once passed through it, is generally\\ncalled in books Bab al-Jabr, the Gate of Repairing (the broken fortunes\\nof a friend or follower). It must not be confounded with the Mahbat\\nJibrail, or the window near it in the Eastern wall, where the archangel\\nusually descended from heaven with the Wahy or Inspiration.\\n[FN#71] By some wonderful process the \"Printer\\'s Devil\" converted, in\\nthe first edition, this \"ball or cone\" into \"bull or cow.\"\\n[FN#72] Belal, the loud-lunged crier, stood, we are informed, by Moslem\\nhistorians, upon a part of the roof on one of the walls of the Mosque.\\nThe minaret, as the next chapter will show, was the invention of a more\\ntasteful age.\\n[FN#73] This abomination may be seen in Egypt on many of the\\ntombs,-those outside the Bal al-Nasr at Cairo, for instance.\\n[FN#74] The tale of this Weeping Pillar is well known. Some suppose it\\nto have been buried beneath the pulpit: others-they are few in\\nnumber-declare that it was inserted in the body of the pulpit.\\n[FN#75] The little domed building which figures in the native sketches,\\nand in all our prints of the Al-Madinah Mosque, was taken down three or\\nfour years ago. It occupied part of the centre of the square, and was\\ncalled Kubbat al-Zayt-Dome of Oil; or Kubbat al-Shama-Dome of\\nCandles,-from its use as a store-room for lamps and wax candles.\\n[FN#76] This is its name among the illiterate, who firmly believe the\\npalms to be descendants of trees planted there by the hands of the\\nProphet\\'s daughter. As far as I could discover, the tradition has no\\nfoundation, and in old times there was no garden in the hypaethral\\ncourt. The vulgar are in the habit of eating a certain kind of date,\\n\"Al-Sayhani,\" in the Mosque, and of throwing the stones about; this\\npractice is violently denounced by the Olema.\\n[FN#77] Rhamnus Nabeca, Forsk. The fruit, called Nabak, is eaten, and\\nthe leaves are used for the purpose of washing dead bodies. The visitor\\nis not forbidden to take fruit or water as presents from Al-Madinah,\\nbut it is unlawful for him to carry away earth, or stones, or cakes of\\ndust, made for sale to the ignorant.\\n[FN#78] The Arabs, who, like all Orientals, are exceedingly curious\\nabout water, take the trouble to weigh the produce of their wells; the\\nlighter the water, the more digestible and wholesome it is considered.\\n[FN#79] The common phenomenon of rivers flowing underground in Arabia\\nhas, doubtless, suggested to the people these subterraneous passages,\\nwith which they connect the most distant places. At Al-Madinah, amongst\\nother tales of short cuts known only to certain Badawi families, a man\\ntold me of a shaft leading from his native city to Hazramaut: according\\nto him, it existed in the times of the Prophet, and was a journey of\\nonly three days!\\n[FN#80] The Mosque Library is kept in large chests near the Bab\\nal-Salam; the only MS. of any value here is a Koran written in the\\nSulsi hand. It is nearly four feet long, bound in a wooden cover, and\\npadlocked, so as to require from the curious a \"silver key.\"\\n[FN#81] So the peasants in Brittany believe that Napoleon the First is\\nnot yet dead; the Prussians expect Frederick the Second; the Swiss,\\nWilliam Tell; the older English, King Arthur; and certain modern\\nfanatics look forward to the re-appearance of Joanna Southcote. Why\\nmultiply instances in so well known a branch of the history of popular\\nsuperstitions?\\n[FN#82] The Sunnat is the custom or practice of the Apostle, rigidly\\nconformed to by every good and orthodox Moslem.\\n[FN#83] The reader will bear in mind that I am quoting from Burckhardt.\\nWhen in Al-Hijaz and at Cairo, I vainly endeavoured to buy a copy of\\nAl-Samanhudi. One was shown to me at Al-Madinah; unhappily, it bore the\\nword Wakf (bequeathed), and belonged to the Mosque. I was scarcely\\nallowed time to read it. (See p. 102, ante.)\\n[FN#84] In Moslem law, prophets, martyrs, and saints, are not supposed\\nto be dead; their property, therefore, remains their own. The Olema\\nhave confounded themselves in the consideration of the prophetic state\\nafter death. Many declare that prophets live and pray for forty days in\\nthe tomb; at the expiration of which time, they are taken to the\\npresence of their Maker, where they remain till the blast of Israfil\\'s\\ntrumpet. The common belief, however, leaves the bodies in the graves,\\nbut no one would dare to assert that the holy ones are suffered to\\nundergo corruption. On the contrary, their faces are blooming, their\\neyes bright, and blood would issue from their bodies if wounded.\\nAl-Islam, as will afterwards appear, abounds in traditions of the\\nancient tombs of saints and martyrs, when accidentally opened, exposing\\nto view corpses apparently freshly buried. And it has come to pass that\\nthis fact, the result of sanctity, has now become an unerring\\nindication of it. A remarkable case in point is that of the late Sharif\\nGhalib, the father of the present Prince of Meccah. In his lifetime he\\nwas reviled as a wicked tyrant. But some years after his death, his\\nbody was found undecomposed; he then became a saint, and men now pray\\nat his tomb. Perhaps his tyranny was no drawback to his holy\\nreputation. La Brinvilliers was declared after execution, by her\\nconfessor and the people generally, a saint;-simply, I presume, because\\nof the enormity of her crimes.\\n[FN#85] NOTE TO THIRD EDITION.-I have lately been assured by Mohammed\\nal-Halabi, Shaykh al-Olema of Damascus, that he was permitted by the\\nAghawat to pass through the gold-plated door leading into the Hujrah,\\nand that he saw no trace of a sepulchre.\\n[FN#86] I was careful to make a ground-plan of the Prophet\\'s Mosque, as\\nBurckhardt was prevented by severe illness from so doing. It will give\\nthe reader a fair idea of the main point, though, in certain minor\\ndetails, it is not to be trusted. Some of my papers and sketches, which\\nby precaution I had placed among my medicines, after cutting them into\\nsquares, numbering them, and rolling them carefully up, were damaged by\\nthe breaking of a bottle. The plan of Al-Madinah is slightly altered\\nfrom Burckhardt\\'s. Nothing can be more ludicrous than the views of the\\nHoly City, as printed in our popular works. They are of the style\\n\"bird\\'s-eye,\" and present a curious perspective. They despise distance\\nlike the Chinese,-pictorially audacious; the Harrah, or ridge in the\\nforeground appears to be 200 yards, instead of three or four miles,\\ndistant from the town. They strip the place of its suburb Al-Manakhah,\\nin order to show the enceinte, omit the fort, and the gardens north and\\nsouth of the city, enlarge the Mosque twenty-fold for dignity, and make\\nit occupy the whole centre of the city, instead of a small corner in\\nthe south-east quarter. They place, for symmetry, towers only at the\\nangles of the walls, instead of all along the curtain, and gather up\\nand press into the same field all the venerable and interesting\\nfeatures of the country, those behind the artist\\'s back, and at his\\nsides, as well as what appears in front. Such are the Turkish\\nlithographs. At Meccah, some Indians support themselves by depicting\\nthe holy shrines; their works are a truly Oriental mixture of ground\\nplan and elevation, drawn with pen and ink, and brightened with the\\nmost vivid colours-grotesque enough, but less unintelligible than the\\nmore ambitious imitations of European art.\\n</p>\\n<h2><span id=\"Chapter_XVII._AN_ESSAY_TOWARDS_THE_HISTORY_OF_THE_PROPHET.27S_MOSQUE.\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Chapter_XVII._AN_ESSAY_TOWARDS_THE_HISTORY_OF_THE_PROPHET\\'S_MOSQUE.\">Chapter XVII.

There they increased and\\nmultiplied, and spread into a mighty empire. At length under the rule\\nof Namrud (Nimrod), son of Kanaan (Canaan), son of Ham, they lapsed\\nfrom the worship of the true God: a miracle dispersed them into distant\\nparts of the earth, and they were further broken up by the one\\nprimaeval language being divided into seventy-two dialects.\\n</p><p>A tribe called Aulad Sam bin Nuh (the children of Shem), or Amalikah\\nand Amalik,[FN#2] from their ancestor Amlak bin Arfakhshad bin Sam bin\\nNuh, was inspired\\n</p><p>[p.344]with a knowledge of the Arabic tongue[FN#3]: it settled at\\nAl-Madinah, and was the first to cultivate the ground and to plant\\npalm-trees. In course of time these people extended over the whole\\ntract between the seas of Al-Hijaz (the Red Sea) and Al-Oman,\\n(north-western part of the Indian Ocean), and they became the\\nprogenitors of the Jababirah[FN#4] (tyrants or \"giants\") of Syria, as\\nwell as the Farainah (Pharaohs) of Egypt.[FN#5] Under these Amalik such\\n</p><p>[p.345]was the age of man that during the space of four hundred years a\\nbier would not be seen, nor \"keening\" be heard, in their cities.\\n</p><p>The last king of the Amalik, \"Arkam bin al-Arkam,[FN#6]\" was, according\\nto most authors, slain by an army of the children of Israel sent by\\nMoses after the Exodus,[FN#7] with orders thoroughly to purge Meccah\\nand Al-Madinah of their Infidel inhabitants. All the tribe was\\ndestroyed, with the exception of the women, the children, and a youth\\nof the royal family, whose extraordinary beauty persuaded the invaders\\nto spare him pending a reference to the Prophet. When the army\\nreturned, they found that Moses had died during the expedition, and\\nthey were received with reproaches by the people for having violated\\nhis express command. The soldiers, unwilling to live with their own\\nnation under this reproach, returned to Al-Hijaz, and settled there.\\n</p><p>Moslem authors are agreed that after the Amalik the Benu Israel ruled\\nin the Holy Land of Arabia, but the learned in history are not agreed\\nupon the cause of their emigration. According to some, when Moses was\\nreturning from a pilgrimage to Meccah, a multitude of his followers,\\nseeing in Al-Madinah the signs of the city which, according to the\\nTaurat, or Pentateuch, should hear the preaching of the last Prophet,\\nsettled there, and were joined by many Badawin of the neighbourhood who\\n</p><p>[p.346]conformed to the law of Moses. Ibn Shaybah also informs us that\\nwhen Moses and Aaron were wending northwards from Meccah, they, being\\nin fear of certain Jews settled at Al-Madinah, did not enter the\\ncity,[FN#8] but pitched their tents on Mount Ohod. Aaron being about to\\ndie, Moses dug his tomb, and said, \"Brother, thine hour is come! turn\\nthy face to the next world!\" Aaron entered the grave, lay at full\\nlength, and immediately expired; upon which the Jewish lawgiver covered\\nhim with earth, and went his way towards the Promised Land.[FN#9]\\n</p><p>Abu Hurayrah asserted that the Benu Israel, after long searching,\\nsettled in Al-Madinah, because, when driven from Palestine by the\\ninvasion of Bukht al-Nasr (Nebuchadnezzar), they found in their books\\nthat the last Prophet would manifest himself in a town of the towns of\\nArabiyah,[FN#10] called Zat Nakhl, or the \"Place of Palm trees.\" Some\\nof the sons of Aaron occupied the city; other tribes settled at\\nKhaybar,[FN#11] and in the neighbourhood,\\n</p><p>[p.347]building \"Utum,\" or square, flat-roofed, stone castles for\\nhabitation and defence. They left an order to their descendants that\\nMohammed should be favourably received, but Allah hardened their hearts\\nunto their own destruction. Like asses they turned their backs upon\\nAllah\\'s mercy,[FN#12] and the consequence is, that they have been\\nrooted out of the land.\\n</p><p>The Tarikh Tabari declares that when Bukht al-Nasr,[FN#13] after\\ndestroying Jerusalem, attacked and slew the king of Egypt, who had\\ngiven an asylum to a remnant of the house of Israel, the persecuted\\nfugitives made their way into Al-Hijaz, settled near Yasrib\\n(Al-Madinah), where they founded several towns, Khaybar, Fadak, Wady\\nal-Subu, Wady al-Kura, Kurayzah, and many others. It appears, then, by\\nthe concurrence of historians, that the Jews at an early time either\\ncolonised, or supplanted the Amalik at, Al-Madinah.\\n</p><p>At length the Israelites fell away from the worship of the one God, who\\nraised up against them the Arab tribes of Aus and Khazraj, the\\nprogenitors of modern Ansar. Both these tribes claimed a kindred\\norigin, and\\n</p><p>[p.348]Al-Yaman as the land of their nativity. The circumstances of\\ntheir emigration are thus described. The descendants of Yarab bin\\nKahtan bin Shalik bin Arkfakhshad bin Sam bin Nuh, kinsmen to the\\nAmalik, inhabited in prosperity the land of Saba.[FN#14] Their sway\\nextended two months\\' journey from the dyke of Mareb,[FN#15] near the\\nmodern capital of Al-Yaman, as far as Syria, and incredible tales are\\ntold of their hospitality and of the fertility of their land. As usual,\\ntheir hearts were perverted by prosperity. They begged Allah to relieve\\nthem from the troubles of extended empire and the duties of hospitality\\nby diminishing their possessions. The consequence of their impious\\nsupplications was the well-known Flood of Iram.\\n</p><p>The chief of the descendants of Kahtan bin Saba, one of the ruling\\nfamilies in Al-Yaman, was one Amru bin Amin Ma al-Sama,[FN#16] called\\n\"Al-Muzaykayh\" from his rending in pieces every garment once worn. His\\nwife Tarikah Himyariah, being skilled in divination, foresaw the fatal\\nevent, and warned her husband, who, unwilling to break from his tribe\\nwithout an excuse, contrived the following stratagem. He privily\\nordered his adopted son, an orphan\\n</p><p>[p.349]to dispute with him, and to strike him in the face at a feast\\ncomposed of the principal persons in the kingdom. The disgrace of such\\na scene afforded him a pretext for selling off his property, and,\\nfollowed by his thirteen sons,-all borne to him by his wife\\nTarikah,-and others of the tribe, Amru emigrated Northwards. The little\\nparty, thus preserved from the Yamanian Deluge, was destined by Allah\\nto become the forefathers of the Auxiliaries of his chosen Apostle.\\n</p><p>All the children of Amru thus dispersed into different parts of Arabia.\\nHis eldest son, Salabah bin Amru, chose Al-Hijaz, settled at\\nAl-Madinah, then in the hands of the impious Benu Israel, and became\\nthe father of the Aus and Khazraj. In course of time, the new comers\\nwere made by Allah an instrument of vengeance against the disobedient\\nJews. Of the latter people, the two tribes Kurayzah and Nazir claimed\\ncertain feudal rights (well known to Europe) upon all occasions of Arab\\nmarriages. The Aus and the Khazraj, after enduring this indignity for a\\ntime, at length had recourse to one of their kinsmen who, when the\\nfamily dispersed, had settled in Syria. Abu Jubaylah, thus summoned,\\nmarched an army to Al-Madinah, avenged the honour of his blood, and\\ndestroyed the power of the Jews, who from that moment became Mawali, or\\nclients to the Arabs.\\n</p><p>For a time the tribes of Aus and Khazraj, freed from the common enemy,\\nlived in peace and harmony. At last they fell into feuds and fought\\nwith fratricidal strife, until the coming of the Prophet effected a\\nreconciliation between them. This did not take place, however, before\\nthe Khazraj received, at the battle of Buas (about A.D. 615), a decided\\ndefeat from the Aus.\\n</p><p>It is also related, to prove how Al-Madinah was predestined to a high\\nfate, that nearly three centuries before the siege of the town by Abu\\nJubaylah, the Tobba\\n</p><p>[p.350]al-Asghar[FN#17] marched Northward, at the requisition of the\\nAus and Khazraj tribes, in order to punish the Jews; or, according to\\nothers, at the request of the Jews to revenge them upon the Aus and\\nKhazraj. After capturing the town, he left one of his sons to govern\\nit, and marched onwards to conquer Syria and Al-Irak.\\n</p><p>Suddenly informed that the people of Al-Madinah had treacherously\\nmurdered their new prince, the exasperated Tobba returned and attacked\\nthe place; and, when his horse was killed under him, he swore that he\\nwould never decamp before razing it to the ground. Whereupon two Jewish\\npriests, Ka\\'ab and Assayd, went over to him and informed him that it\\nwas not in the power of man to destroy the town, it being preserved by\\nAllah, as their books proved, for the refuge of His Prophet, the\\ndescendant of Ishmael.[FN#18]\\n</p><p>The Tobba Judaized. Taking four hundred of the priests with him, he\\ndeparted from Al-Madinah, performed pilgrimage to the Ka\\'abah of\\nMeccah, which he invested with a splendid covering[FN#19]; and, after\\nerecting a house\\n</p><p>[p.351]for the expected Prophet, he returned to his capital in\\nAl-Yaman, where he abolished idolatry by the ordeal of fire. He treated\\nhis priestly guests with particular attention, and on his death-bed he\\nwrote the following tetrastich:-\\n</p><p>\"I testify of Ahmad that he of a truth\\n\"Is a prophet from Allah, the Maker of souls.\\nBe my age extended into his age,\\nI would be to him a Wazir and a cousin.\"\\n</p><p>Then sealing the paper he committed it to the charge of the High\\nPriest, with a solemn injunction to deliver the letter, should an\\nopportunity offer, into the hands of the great Prophet; and that, if\\nthe day be distant, the missive should be handed down from generation\\nto generation till it reached the person to whom it was addressed. The\\nhouse founded by him at Al-Madinah was committed to a priest of whose\\ndescendants was Abu Ayyub the Ansari, the first person over whose\\nthreshold the Apostle passed when he ended the Flight. Abu Ayyub had\\nalso charge of the Tobba\\'s letter, so that after three or four\\ncenturies, it arrived at its destination.\\n</p><p>Al-Madinah was ever well inclined to Mohammed. In[FN#20]\\n</p><p>[p.352]the early part of his career, the emissaries of a tribe called\\nthe Benu Abd al-Ashhal came from that town to Meccah, in order to make\\na treaty with the Kuraysh, and the Apostle seized the opportunity of\\npreaching Al-Islam to them. His words were seconded by Ayyas bin Ma\\'az,\\na youth of the tribe, and opposed by the chiefs of the embassy; who,\\nhowever, returned home without pledging themselves to either\\nparty.[FN#21] Shortly afterwards a body of the Aus and the Khazraj came\\nto the pilgrimage of Meccah: when Mohammed began preaching to them,\\nthey recognised the person so long expected by the Jews, and swore to\\nhim an oath which is called in Moslem history the \"First Fealty of the\\nSteep.[FN#22]\"\\n</p><p>After the six individuals who had thus pledged themselves returned to\\ntheir native city, the event being duly bruited abroad caused such an\\neffect that, when the next pilgrimage season came, twelve, or according\\nto others forty persons, led by As\\'ad bin Zara[r]ah, accompanied the\\noriginal converts, and in the same place swore the \"Second Fealty of\\nthe Steep.\" The Prophet dismissed them in company with one Musab bin\\nUmayr, a Meccan, charged to teach them the Koran and their religious\\nduties, which in those times consisted only of prayer and the\\nProfession of Unity. They arrived at Al-Madinah on a Friday, and this\\nwas the first day on which the city witnessed the public devotions of\\nthe Moslems.\\n</p><p>After some persecutions, Musab had the fortune to convert a cousin of\\nAs\\'ad bin Zararah, a chief of the Aus, Sa\\'ad bin Ma\\'az, whose\\nopposition had been of the fiercest. He persuaded his tribe, the Benu\\nAbd al-Ashhal, to break\\n</p><p>[p.353]their idols and openly to profess Al-Islam. The next season,\\nMusab having made many converts, some say seventy, others three\\nhundred, marched from Al-Madinah to Meccah for their pilgrimage; and\\nthere induced his followers to meet the Prophet at midnight upon the\\nSteep near Muna. Mohammed preached to them their duties towards Allah\\nand himself, especially insisting upon the necessity of warring down\\ninfidelity. They pleaded ancient treaties with the Jews of Al-Madinah,\\nand showed apprehension lest the Apostle, after bringing them into\\ndisgrace with their fellows, should desert them and return to the faith\\nof his kinsmen, the Kuraysh. Mohammed, smiling, comforted them with the\\nassurance that he was with them, body and soul, for ever. Upon this\\nthey asked him what would be their reward if slain. He replied,\\n\"Gardens \\'neath which the streams flow,\"-that is to say, Paradise.\\n</p><p>Then, in spite of the advice of Al-Abbas, Mohammed\\'s uncle, who was\\nloud in his denunciations, they bade the Preacher stretch out his hand,\\nand upon it swore the oath known as the \"Great Fealty of the Steep.\"\\nAfter comforting them with an Ayat, or Koranic verse, which promised\\nheaven, the Apostle divided his followers into twelve bodies; and\\nplacing a chief at the head of each,[FN#23] dismissed them to their\\nhomes. He rejected the offer made by one of the party-namely, to slay\\nall the idolaters present at the pilgrimage-saying that Allah had\\nfavoured him with no such order. For the same reason he refused their\\ninvitation to visit Al-Madinah, which was the principal object of their\\nmission; and he then took an affectionate leave of them.\\n</p><p>[p.354]Two months and a half after the events above detailed, Mohammed\\nreceived the inspired tidings that Al-Madinah of the Hijaz was his\\npredestined asylum. In anticipation of the order, for as yet the time\\nhad not been revealed, he sent forward his friends, among whom were\\nOmar, Talhah, and Hamzah, retaining with him Abu Bakr[FN#24] and Ali.\\nThe particulars of the Flight, that eventful accident to Al-Islam, are\\ntoo well known to require mention here; besides which they belong\\nrather to the category of general than of Madinite history.\\n</p><p>Mohammed was escorted into Al-Madinah by one Buraydat al-Aslami and\\neighty men of the same tribe, who had been offered by the Kuraysh a\\nhundred camels for the capture of the fugitives. But Buraydat, after\\nlistening to their terms, accidentally entered into conversation with\\nMohammed; and no sooner did he hear the name of his interlocutor, than\\nhe professed the faith of Al-Islam. He then prepared for the Apostle a\\nstandard by attaching his turband to a spear, and anxiously inquired\\nwhat house was to be honoured by the presence of Allah\\'s chosen\\nservant. \"Whichever,\" replied Mohammed, \"this she-camel[FN#25] is\\nordered to show me.\" At the last\\n</p><p>[p.355]halting-place, he accidentally met some of his disciples\\nreturning from a trading voyage to Syria; they dressed him and his\\ncompanion Abu Bakr in white clothing which, it is said, caused the\\npeople of Kuba to pay a mistaken reverence to the latter. The Moslems\\nof Al-Madinah were in the habit of repairing every morning to the\\nheights near the city, looking out for the Apostle; and, when the sun\\nwaxed hot, they returned home. One day, about noon, a Jew, who\\ndiscovered the retinue from afar, suddenly warned the nearest party of\\nAnsar, or Auxiliaries of Al-Madinah, that the fugitive was come. They\\nsnatched up their arms and hurried from their houses to meet him.\\n</p><p>Mohammed\\'s she-camel advanced to the centre of the then flourishing\\ntown of Kuba. There she suddenly knelt upon a place which is now\\nconsecrated ground; at that time it was an open space, belonging, they\\nsay, to Abu Ayyub the Ansari, who had a house there near the abodes of\\nthe Benu Amr bin Auf. This event happened on the first day of the week,\\nthe twelfth of the month Rabia al-Awwal[FN#26] (June 28, A.D. 622), in\\nthe first year of the Flight: for which reason Monday, which also\\nwitnessed the birth, the mission, and the death of the Prophet, is an\\nauspicious day to Al-Islam.\\n</p><p>After halting two days in the house of Kulsum bin Hadmah at Kuba, and\\nthere laying the foundation of the\\n</p><p>[p.356]first Mosque upon the lines where his she-camel trod, the\\nApostle was joined by Ali, who had remained at Meccah, for the purpose\\nof returning certain trusts and deposits committed to Mohammed\\'s\\ncharge. He waited three days longer; on Friday morning (the 16th Rabia\\nal-Awwal, A.H. 1,=2nd July, A.D. 622), about sunrise he mounted\\nAl-Kaswa, and, accompanied by a throng of armed Ansar on foot and on\\nhorseback, he took the way to the city. At the hour of public\\nprayer,[FN#27] he halted in the Wady or valley near Kuba, upon the spot\\nwhere the Masjid al-Jum\\'ah now stands, performed his devotions, and\\npreached an eloquent sermon. He then remounted. Numbers pressed forward\\nto offer him hospitality; he blessed them, and bade them stand out of\\nthe way, declaring that Al-Kaswa would halt of her own accord at the\\npredestined spot. He then advanced to where the Apostle\\'s pulpit now\\nstands. There the she-camel knelt, and the rider exclaimed, as one\\ninspired, \"This is our place, if Almighty Allah please!\"\\n</p><p>Descending from Al-Kaswa, he recited, \"O Lord, cause me to alight a\\ngood Alighting, and Thou art the Best of those who cause to alight!\"\\nPresently the camel rose unaided, advanced a few steps, and then,\\naccording to some, returning, sat down upon her former seat; according\\nto others, she knelt at the door of Abu Ayyub al-Ansari, whose abode in\\nthose days was the nearest to the halting-place. The descendant of the\\nJewish High Priest in the time of the Tobbas, with the Apostle\\'s\\npermission, took the baggage off the camel, and carried it into his\\nhouse. Then ensued great rejoicings. The Abyssinians came and played\\nwith their spears. The\\n</p><p><br />\\n[p.357]maidens of the Benu Najjar tribe sang and beat their\\nkettle-drums. And all the wives of the Ansar celebrated with shrill\\ncries of joy the auspicious event; whilst the males, young and old,\\nfreemen and slaves, shouted with effusion, \"Allah\\'s Messenger is come!\\nAllah\\'s Messenger is here!\"\\n</p><p>Mohammed caused Abu Ayyub and his wife to remove into the upper story,\\ncontenting himself with the humbler lower rooms. This was done for the\\ngreater convenience of receiving visitors without troubling the family;\\nbut the master of the house was thereby rendered uncomfortable in mind.\\nHis various remarks about the Apostle\\'s diet and domestic habits,\\nespecially his avoiding leeks, onions, and garlic,[FN#28] are gravely\\nchronicled by Moslem authors.\\n</p><p>After spending seven months, more or less, at the house of Abu Ayyub,\\nMohammed, now surrounded by his wives and family, built, close to the\\nMosque, huts for their reception. The ground was sold to him by Sahal\\nand Suhayl, two orphans of the Benu Najjar,[FN#29] a noble family of\\nthe Khazraj. Some time afterwards one Harisat bin al-Nu\\'uman presented\\nto the Prophet all his houses in the vicinity of the temple. In those\\ndays the habitations of the Arabs were made of a framework of Jarid or\\npalm sticks, covered over with a cloth of camel\\'s hair, a curtain of\\nsimilar stuff forming the door. The more splendid had walls of unbaked\\nbrick, and roofs of palm fronds plastered\\n</p><p>[p.358]over with mud or clay. Of this description were the abodes of\\nMohammed\\'s family. Most of them were built on the North and East of the\\nMosque, which had open ground on the Western side; and the doors looked\\ntowards the place of prayer. In course of time, all, except Abu\\nBakr[FN#30] and Ali, were ordered to close their doors, and even Omar\\nwas refused the favour of having a window opening into the temple.\\n</p><p>Presently the Jews of Al-Madinah, offended by the conduct of Abdullah\\nbin Salam, their most learned priest and a descendant from the\\nPatriarch Joseph, who had become a convert to the Moslem dispensation,\\nbegan to plot against Mohammed.[FN#31] They were headed by Hajj bin\\nAkhtah, and his brother Yasir bin Akhtah, and were joined by many of\\nthe Aus and the Khazraj. The events that followed this combination of\\nthe Munafikun, or Hypocrites, under their chief, Abdullah, belong to\\nthe domain of Arabian history.[FN#32]\\n</p><p>Mohammed spent the last ten years of his life at Al-Madinah. He died on\\nMonday, some say at nine A.M., others at noon, others a little after,\\non the twelfth of Rabia al-Awwal in the eleventh year of the Hijrah.\\nWhen his family and companions debated where he should be buried, Ali\\nadvised Al-Madinah, and Abu Bakr, Ayishah\\'s chamber,\\n</p><p>[p.359]quoting a saying of the deceased that prophets and martyrs are\\nalways interred where they happen to die. The Apostle was placed, it is\\nsaid, under the bed where he had given up the ghost, by Ali and the two\\nsons of Abbas, who dug the grave. With the life of Mohammed the\\ninterest of Al-Madinah ceases, or rather is concentrated in the history\\nof its temple. Since then the city has passed through the hands of the\\nCaliphs, the Sharifs of Meccah, the Sultans of Constantinople, the\\nWahhabis, and the Egyptians. It has now reverted to the Sultan, whose\\ngovernment is beginning to believe that, in these days when religious\\nprestige is of little value, the great Khan\\'s title, \"Servant of the\\nHoly Shrines,\" is purchased at too high a price. As has before been\\nobserved, the Turks now struggle for existence in Al-Hijaz with a\\nsoldier ever in arrears, and officers unequal to the task of managing\\nan unruly people. The pensions are but partly paid,[FN#33] and they are\\nnot likely to increase with years. It is probably a mere consideration\\nof interest that prevents the people rising en masse,\\n</p><p>[p.360]and re-asserting the liberties of their country. And I have\\nheard from authentic sources that the Wahhabis look forward to the day\\nwhen a fresh crusade will enable them to purge the land of its\\nabominations in the shape of silver and gold.\\n</p><p>The Masjid al-Nabi, or Prophet\\'s Mosque, is the second in Al-Islam in\\npoint of seniority, and the second, or, according to others, the first\\nin dignity, ranking with the Ka\\'abah itself. It is erected around the\\nspot where the she-camel, Al-Kaswa, knelt down by the order of Heaven.\\nAt that time the land was a palm grove and a Mirbad, or place where\\ndates are dried. Mohammed, ordered to erect a place of worship there,\\nsent for the youths to whom it belonged, and certain Ansar, or\\nAuxiliaries, their guardians; the ground was offered to him in free\\ngift, but he insisted upon purchasing it, paying more than its value.\\nHaving caused the soil to be levelled and the trees to be felled, he\\nlaid the foundation of the first Mosque.\\n</p><p>In those times of primitive simplicity its walls were made of rough\\nstone and unbaked bricks: trunks of date-trees supported a palm-stick\\nroof, concerning which the Archangel Gabriel delivered an order that it\\nshould not be higher than seven cubits, the elevation of Moses\\'s\\ntemple. All ornament was strictly forbidden. The Ansar, or men of\\nAl-Madinah, and the Muhajirin, or Fugitives from Meccah, carried the\\nbuilding materials in their arms from the cemetery Al-Bakia, near the\\nwell of Ayyub, north of the spot where Ibrahim\\'s Mosque now stands, and\\nthe Apostle was to be seen aiding them in their labours, and reciting\\nfor their encouragement,\\n</p><p>\"O Allah! there is no good but the good of futurity,\\nThen have mercy upon my Ansar and Muhajirin!\"\\n</p><p>The length of this Mosque was fifty-four cubits from North to South,\\nand sixty-three in breadth, and it was hemmed in by houses on all sides\\nsave the Western. Till the seventeenth\\n</p><p>[p.361]month of the new aera the congregation faced towards the\\nNorthern wall. After that time a fresh revelation turned them in the\\ndirection of Meccah, Southwards: on which occasion the Archangel\\nGabriel descended and miraculously opened through the hills and wilds a\\nview of the Ka\\'abah, that there might be no difficulty in ascertaining\\nits true position.\\n</p><p>After the capture of Khaybar in A.H. 7, the Prophet and his first three\\nsuccessors restored the Mosque, but Moslem historians do not consider\\nthis a second foundation. Mohammed laid the first brick, and Abu\\nHurayrah declares that he saw him carry heaps of building materials\\npiled up to his breast. The Caliphs, each in the turn of his\\nsuccession, placed a brick close to that laid by the Prophet, and aided\\nhim in raising the walls. Al-Tabrani relates that one of the Ansar had\\na house adjacent which Mohammed wished to make part of the place of\\nprayer; the proprietor was promised in exchange for it a home in\\nParadise, which he gently rejected, pleading poverty. His excuse was\\nadmitted, and Osman, after purchasing the place for ten thousand\\ndirhams, gave it to the Apostle on the long credit originally offered.\\n</p><p>This Mosque was a square of a hundred cubits. Like the former building,\\nit had three doors: one on the South side, where the Mihrab al-Nabawi,\\nor the \"Prophet\\'s Niche,\" now is; another in the place of the present\\nBab al-Rahmah; and the third at the Bab Osman, now called the Gate of\\nGabriel. Instead of a Mihrab or prayer-niche,[FN#34] a large block of\\nstone directed the congregation; at first it was placed against the\\nNorthern wall\\n</p><p>[p.362]of the Mosque, and it was removed to the Southern when Meccah\\nbecame the Kiblah.\\n</p><p>In the beginning the Prophet, whilst preaching the Khutbah or Friday\\nsermon, leaned when fatigued against a post.[FN#35] The Mambar,[FN#36]\\nor pulpit, was the invention of a Madinah man, of the Benu Najjar. It\\nwas a wooden frame, two cubits long by one broad, with three steps,\\neach one span high; on the topmost of these the Prophet sat when he\\nrequired rest. The pulpit assumed its present form about A.H. 90,\\nduring the artistic reign of Al-Walid.\\n</p><p>In this Mosque Mohammed spent the greater part of the day[FN#37] with\\nhis companions, conversing, instructing, and\\n</p><p>[p.363]comforting the poor. Hard by were the abodes of his wives, his\\nfamily, and his principal friends. Here he prayed, at the call of the\\nAzan, or devotion-cry, from the roof. Here he received worldly envoys\\nand embassies, and the heavenly messages conveyed by the Archangel\\nGabriel. And within a few yards of the hallowed spot, he died, and\\nfound a grave.\\n</p><p>The theatre of events so important to Al-Islam could not be\\nallowed-specially as no divine decree forbade the change-to remain in\\nits pristine lowliness. The first Caliph contented himself with merely\\nrestoring some of the palm pillars, which had fallen to the ground:\\nOmar, the second successor, surrounded the Hujrah, or Ayishah\\'s\\nchamber, in which the Prophet was buried, with a mud wall; and in A.H.\\n17, he enlarged the Mosque to 140 cubits by 120, taking in ground on\\nall sides except the Eastern, where stood the abodes of the \"Mothers of\\nthe Moslems.[FN#38]\" Outside the Northern wall he erected a Suffah,\\ncalled Al-Batha-a raised bench of wood, earth, or stone, upon which the\\npeople might recreate themselves with conversation and quoting poetry,\\nfor the Mosque was now becoming [a] place of peculiar reverence to\\nmen.[FN#39]\\n</p><p>The second Masjid was erected A.H. 29, by the third Caliph, Osman, who,\\nregardless of the clamours of the people, overthrew the old walls and\\nextended the building\\n</p><p>[p.364]greatly towards the North, and a little towards the West; but he\\ndid not remove the Eastern limit on account of the private houses. He\\nmade the roof of Indian teak,[FN#40] and the walls of hewn and carved\\nstone. These innovations caused some excitement, which he allayed by\\nquoting a tradition of the Prophet, with one of which he appears\\nperpetually to have been prepared. The saying in question was,\\naccording to some, \"Were this my Mosque extended to Safa\"-a hill in\\nMeccah-\"it verily would still be my Mosque\"; according to others, \"Were\\nthe Prophet\\'s Mosque extended to Zu\\'l Halifah[FN#41] it would still be\\nhis.\" But Osman\\'s skill in the quotation of tradition did not prevent\\nthe new building being in part a cause of his death. It was finished on\\nthe first Muharram, A.H. 30.\\n</p><p>At length, Al-Islam, grown splendid and powerful, determined to surpass\\nother nations in the magnificence of its public buildings.[FN#42] In\\nA.H. 88, Al-Walid[FN#43] the First, twelfth Caliph of the Benu Ummayah\\nrace, after building, or rather restoring, the noble \"Jami\\' al-Ammawi\"\\n(cathedral of the Ommiades) at Damascus, determined to\\n</p><p>[p.365]display his liberality at Al-Madinah. The governor of the place,\\nUmar bin Abd Al-Aziz, was directed to buy for seven thousand Dinars\\n(ducats) all the hovels of raw brick that hedged in the Eastern side of\\nthe old Mosque. They were inhabited by descendants of the Prophet and\\nof the early Caliphs, and in more than one case, the ejection of the\\nholy tenantry was effected with considerable difficulty. Some of the\\nwomen-ever the most obstinate on such occasions-refused to take money,\\nand Omar was forced to the objectionable measure of turning them out of\\ndoors with exposed faces[FN#45] in full day. The Greek Emperor, applied\\nto by the magnificent Caliph, sent immense presents, silver lamp\\nchains, valuable curiosities,[FN#46] forty loads of small cut stones\\nfor pietra-dura, and a sum of eighty thousand Dinars, or, as others\\nsay, forty thousand Miskals of gold. He also despatched forty Coptic\\nand forty Greek artists to carve the marble pillars and the casings of\\nthe walls, and to superintend the gilding and the mosaic work. One of\\nthese Christians was beheaded for sculpturing a hog on the Kiblah wall;\\nand another, in an attempt to defile the roof, fell to the ground, and\\nhis brains were dashed out. The remainder Islamized, but this did not\\nprevent the older Arabs murmuring that their Mosque had been turned\\ninto a Kanisah, a Christian idol-house.\\n</p><p>The Hujrah, or chamber, where, by Mohammed\\'s permission, Azrail, the\\nAngel of Death, separated his\\n</p><p>[p.366]soul from his body, whilst his head was lying in the lap of\\nAyishah, his favourite wife, was now for the first time taken into the\\nMosque. The raw-brick enceinte[FN#46] which surrounded the three graves\\nwas exchanged for one of carved stone, enclosed by an outer precinct\\nwith a narrow passage between.[FN#47] These double walls were either\\nwithout a door, or had only a small blocked-up wicket on the Northern\\nside, and from that day (A.H. 90), no one, says Al-Samanhudi, has been\\nable to approach the sepulchre.[FN#48] A minaret was erected at each\\ncorner of the Mosque.[FN#49] The building was enlarged to 200 cubits by\\n167, and was finished in A.H. 91. When Al-Walid, the Caliph, visited it\\nin state, he inquired of his lieutenant why greater magnificence had\\nnot been displayed in the erection; upon which Omar, the governor,\\ninformed him,\\n</p><p>[p.367]to his astonishment, that the walls alone had cost forty-five\\nthousand ducats.[FN#50]\\n</p><p>The fourth Mosque was erected in A.H. 191, by Al-Mahdi, third prince of\\nthe Benu Abbas or Baghdad Caliphs-celebrated in history only for\\nspending enormous sums upon a pilgrimage. He enlarged the building by\\nadding ten handsome pillars of carved marble, with gilt capitals, on\\nthe Northern side. In A.H. 202, Al-Ma\\'amun made further additions to\\nthis Mosque. It was from Al-Mahdi\\'s Masjid that Al-Hakim bi\\'Amri \\'llah,\\nthe third Fatimite Caliph of Egypt, and the deity of the Druze sect,\\ndetermined to steal the bodies of the Prophet and his two companions.\\nAbout A.H. 412, he sent emissaries to Al-Madinah: the attempt, however,\\nfailed, and the would-be violators of the tomb lost their lives. It is\\ngenerally supposed that Al-Hakim\\'s object was to transfer the\\nVisitation to his own capital; but in one so manifestly insane it is\\ndifficult to discover the spring of action. Two Christians, habited\\nlike Maghrabi pilgrims, in A.H. 550, dug a mine from a neighbouring\\nhouse into the temple. They were discovered, beheaded, and burned to\\nashes. In relating these events the Moslem historians mix up many\\nfoolish preternaturalisms with credible matter. At last, to prevent a\\nrecurrence of such sacrilegious attempts, Al-Malik al-Adil Nur al-Din\\nof the Baharite Mamluk Sultans, or, according to others, Sultan Nur\\nal-Din Shahid Mahmud bin Zangi, who, warned by a vision of the Apostle,\\nhad started for Al-Madinah only in time to discover the two Christians,\\nsurrounded the holy place with a deep trench filled with molten lead.\\nBy this means Abu Bakr and Omar, who had run considerable risks of\\ntheir own, have ever since been enabled to occupy their last homes\\nundisturbed.\\n</p><p>In A.H. 654, the fifth Mosque was erected in consequence of a fire,\\nwhich some authors attribute to a\\n</p><p>[p.368]volcano that broke out close to the town in terrible\\neruption[FN#51]; others, with more fanaticism and less probability, to\\nthe schismatic Benu Husayn, then the guardians of the tomb. On this\\noccasion the Hujrah was saved, together with the old and venerable\\ncopies of the Koran there deposited, especially the Cufic MSS., written\\nby Osman, the third Caliph. The piety of three sovereigns, Al-Mustasim\\n(last Caliph of Baghdad), Al-Muzaffar Shems al-Din Yusuf, chief of\\nAl-Yaman, and Al-Zahir Beybars, Baharite Sultan of Egypt, completed the\\nwork in A.H. 688. This building was enlarged and beautified by the\\nprinces of Egypt, and lasted upwards of two hundred years.\\n</p><p>The sixth Mosque was built, almost as it now stands, by Kaid-Bey,\\nnineteenth Sultan of the Circassian Mamluk kings of Egypt, in A.H. 888:\\nit is now therefore more than four centuries old. Al-Mustasim\\'s Mosque\\nhad been struck by lightning during a storm; thirteen men were killed\\nat prayers, and the destroying element spared nothing but the interior\\nof the Hujrah.[FN#52] The railing and dome were restored; niches and a\\npulpit were sent from Cairo, and the gates and minarets were\\ndistributed as they are now. Not content with this, Kaid-Bey\\nestablished \"Wakf\" (bequests) and pensions, and introduced order among\\nthe attendants on the tomb. In the tenth century, Sultan Sulayman the\\nMagnificent paved with fine white marble the Rauzah or garden, which\\nKaid-Bey, not daring to alter, had left of earth, and erected the fine\\nminaret that bears his name.\\n</p><p>[p.369]During the dominion of the later Sultans, and of Mohammed Ali, a\\nfew trifling presents, of lamps, carpets, wax candles and chandeliers,\\nand a few immaterial alterations, have been made. The present head of\\nAl-Islam is, as I have before said, rebuilding one of the minarets and\\nthe Northern colonnade of the temple.\\n</p><p>Such is the history of the Mosque\\'s prosperity.\\n</p><p>During the siege of Al-Madinah by the Wahhabis,[FN#53] the principal\\npeople seized and divided amongst themselves the treasures of the tomb,\\nwhich must have been considerable. When the town surrendered, Sa\\'ud,\\naccompanied by his principal officers, entered the Hujrah, but,\\nterrified by dreams, he did not penetrate behind the curtain, or\\nattempt to see the tomb. He plundered, however, the treasures in the\\npassage, the \"Kaukab al-Durri[FN#54]\" (or pearl star), and the\\nornaments sent as presents from every part of Al-Islam. Part of these\\nhe sold, it is said, for 150,000 Riyals (dollars), to Ghalib, Sharif of\\nMeccah, and the rest he carried with him to Daraiyah, his\\ncapital.[FN#55] An accident prevented any further desecration of the\\nbuilding. The greedy Wahhabis, allured by the appearance of the golden\\nor gilt globes and crescents surmounting the green dome, attempted to\\nthrow down the latter. Two of their number, it is said, were killed by\\nfalling\\n</p><p>[p.370]from the slippery roof,[FN#56] and the rest, struck by\\nsuperstitious fears, abandoned the work of destruction. They injured,\\nhowever, the prosperity of the place by taxing the inhabitants, by\\ninterrupting the annual remittances, and by forbidding visitors to\\napproach the tomb. They are spoken of with abhorrence by the people,\\nwho quote a peculiarly bad trait in their characters, namely, that in\\nreturn for any small religious assistance of prayer or recitation, they\\nwere in the habit of giving a few grains of gunpowder, or something\\nequally valuable, instead of \"stone-dollars.[FN#57]\"\\n</p><p>When Abdullah, son of Sa\\'ud, had concluded in A.D. 1815 a treaty of\\npeace with Tussun Pasha, the Egyptian General bought back from the\\ntownspeople, for 10,000 Riyals, all the golden vessels that had not\\nbeen melted down, and restored the treasure to its original place. This\\nI have heard denied; at the same time it rests upon credible evidence.\\nAmongst Orientals the events of the last generation are, usually\\nspeaking, imperfectly remembered, and the Olema are well acquainted\\nwith the history of vicissitudes which took place 1200 years ago, when\\nprofoundly ignorant of what their grandfathers witnessed. Many\\nincredible tales also I heard concerning the present wealth of the\\nAl-Madinah Mosque: this must be expected when the exaggeration is\\nconsidered likely to confer honour upon the exaggerator.\\n</p><p><br />\\nThe establishment attached to the Al-Madinah Mosque is greatly altered\\nsince Burckhardt\\'s time,[FN#58] the result of the increasing influence\\nof the Turkish half-breeds\\n</p><p>[p.371]It is still extensive, because in the first place the principle\\nof divided labour is a favourite throughout the East, and secondly\\nbecause the Sons of the Holy Cities naturally desire to extract as much\\nas they can from the Sons of other cities with the least amount of\\nwork. The substance of the following account was given to me by Omar\\nEffendi, and I compared it with the information of others upon whom I\\ncould rely.\\n</p><p>The principal of the Mosque, or Shaykh al-Harim, is no longer a\\nneuter.[FN#59] The present is a Turkish Pasha, Osman, appointed from\\nConstantinople with a salary of about 30,000 piastres a month. His Naib\\nor deputy is a black eunuch, the chief of the Aghawat,[FN#60] upon a\\npay of 5000 piastres. The present principal of this college is one\\nTayfur Agha, a slave of Esma Sultanah, sister to the late Sultan\\nMahmud. The chief treasurer is called the Mudir al-Harim; he keeps an\\neye upon the Khaznadar, or treasurer, whose salary is 2000 piastres.\\nThe Mustaslim is the chief of the Katibs, or writers who settle the\\n</p><p>[p.372]accounts of the Mosque; his pay is 1500, and under him is a\\nNakib or assistant upon 1000 piastres. There are three Shaykhs of the\\neunuchs who receive from 700 to 1000 piastres a month each. The\\neunuchs, about a hundred and twenty in number, are divided into three\\norders. The Bawwabin, or porters, open the doors of the Mosque. The\\nKhubziyah sweep the purer parts of the temple, and the lowest order,\\npopularly called \"Battalin,\" clean away all impurities, beat those\\nfound sleeping, and act as beadles, a duty here which involves\\nconsiderable use of the cane. These men receive as perquisites presents\\nfrom each visitor when they offer him the usual congratulation, and for\\nother small favours, such as permitting strangers to light the\\nlamps,[FN#61] or to sweep the floor. Their pay varies from 250 to 500\\npiastres a month: they are looked upon as honourable men, and are,\\ngenerally speaking, married, some of them indulging in three or four\\nwives,-which would have aroused Juvenal\\'s bile. The Agha\\'s character is\\ncurious and exceptional as his outward conformation. Disconnected with\\nhumanity, he is cruel, fierce, brave, and capable of any villany. His\\nframe is unnaturally long and lean, especially the arms and legs, with\\nhigh shoulders, protruding joints, and a face by contrast\\nextraordinarily large; he is unusually expert in the use of weapons,\\nand sitting well \"home,\" he rides to admiration, his hoarse, thick\\nvoice investing him with all the circumstances of command.\\n</p><p>Besides the eunuchs, there are a number of free servants, called\\nFarrashin, attached to the Mosque; almost all the middle and lower\\nclass of citizens belong to this order. They are divided into parties\\nof thirty each, and are changed every week, those on duty receiving a\\nGhazi or twenty-two piastres for their services. Their business\\n</p><p>[p.373]is to dust, and to spread the carpets, to put oil and wicks into\\nthe lamps which the eunuchs let down from the ceiling, and, generally\\nspeaking, diligently to do nothing.\\n</p><p>Finally, the menial establishment of the Mosque consists of a Shaykh\\nal-Sakka (chief of the water-carriers), under whom are from forty-five\\nto fifty men who sprinkle the floors, water the garden, and, for a\\nconsideration, supply a cupful of brackish liquid to visitors.\\n</p><p><br />\\nThe literary establishment is even more extensive than the executive\\nand the menial. There is a Kazi, or chief judge, sent every year from\\nConstantinople. After twelve months at Al-Madinah, he passes on to\\nMeccah, and returns home after a similar term of service in the second\\nHoly City. Under him are three Muftis,[FN#62] of the Hanafi, the\\nShafe\\'i, and the Maliki schools; the fourth, or Hanbali, is not\\nrepresented here or at Cairo.[FN#63] Each of these officers receives as\\npay about two hundred and fifty piastres a month. The Ruasa,[FN#64] as\\nthe Mu\\'ezzins (prayer-callers) here call themselves, are extensively\\nrepresented; there are forty-eight or forty-nine of the lowest order,\\npresided over by six Kubar or Masters, and these again are under the\\nShaykh al-Ruasa, who alone has the privilege of calling to prayers from\\nthe Raisiyah minaret. The Shaykh receives a hundred and fifty piastres,\\nthe chiefs about a hundred, and the common criers sixty; there are\\n</p><p>[p.374]forty-five Khatibs, who preach and pray before the congregation\\non Fridays for a hundred and twenty piastres a month; they are under\\nthe Shaykh al-Khutaba. About the same sum is given to seventy-five\\nImams, who recite the five ordinary prayers of every day in the Mosque;\\nthe Shaykh al-Aimmat is their superior.[FN#65]\\n</p><p>Almost all the citizens of Al-Madinah who have not some official charge\\nabout the temple qualify themselves to act as Muzawwirs. They begin as\\nboys to learn the formula of prayer, and the conducting of visitors;\\nand partly by begging, partly by boldness, they often pick up a\\ntolerable livelihood at an early age. The Muzawwir will often receive\\nstrangers into his house, as was done to me, and direct their devotions\\nduring the whole time of their stay. For such service he requires a sum\\nof money proportioned to his guests\\' circumstances, but this fee does\\nnot end the connexion. If the Muzawwir visit the home of his Zair, he\\nexpects to be treated with the utmost hospitality, and to depart with a\\nhandsome present. A religious visitor will often transmit to his\\ncicerone at Meccah and at Al-Madinah yearly sums to purchase for\\nhimself a prayer at the Ka\\'abah and the Prophet\\'s Tomb. The remittance\\nis usually wrapped up in paper, and placed in a sealed leathern bag,\\nsomewhat like a portfolio, upon which is worked the name of the person\\nentitled to receive it. It is then given in charge either to a\\ntrustworthy pilgrim, or to the public treasurer, who accompanies the\\nprincipal caravans.\\n</p><p>I could procure no exact information about the amount of money\\nforwarded every year from Constantinople and Cairo to Al-Madinah; the\\nonly point upon which men seemed to agree was that they were defrauded\\nof half their dues. When the Sadaka and Aukaf (the alms and bequests)\\narrive at the town, they are committed by the Surrah, or\\n</p><p>[p.375]financier of the caravan, to the Muftis, the chief of the\\nKhatibs, and the Kazi\\'s clerk. These officers form a committee, and\\nafter reckoning the total of the families entitled to pensions, divide\\nthe money amongst them, according to the number in each household, and\\nthe rank of the pensioners. They are divided into five orders:-\\nThe Olema, or learned, and the Mudarrisin, who profess, lecture, or\\nteach adults in the Harim.\\nThe Imams and Khatibs.\\nThe descendants of the Prophet.\\nThe Fukaha, poor divines, pedadogues, gerund-grinders, who teach boys\\nto read the Koran.\\nThe Awam, or nobile vulgus of the Holy City, including the Ahali, or\\nburghers of the town, and the Mujawirin, or those settled in the place.\\nOmar Effendi belonged to the second order, and he informed me that his\\nshare varied from three to fifteen Riyals per annum.\\n</p><p>[FN#1] In Oriental geography the parasang still, as in the days of\\nPliny, greatly varies, from 1500 to 6000 yards. Captain Francklin,\\nwhose opinion is generally taken, makes it (in his Tour to Persia) a\\nmeasure of about four miles (Preface to Ibn Haukal, by Sir Gore\\nOuseley).\\n[FN#2] M.C. de Perceval (Essai sur l\\'Histoire des Arabes avant\\nl\\'Islamisme), makes Amlak son of Laoud (Lud), son of Shem, or,\\naccording to others, son of Ham. That learned writer identifies the\\nAmalik with the Phoenicians, the Amalekites, the Canaanites, and the\\nHyksos. He alludes, also, to an ancient tradition which makes them to\\nhave colonised Barbary in Africa.\\n[FN#3] The Dabistan al-Mazahib relates a tradition that the Almighty,\\nwhen addressing the angels in command, uses the Arabic tongue, but when\\nspeaking in mercy or beneficence, the Deri dialect of Persian.\\n[FN#4] These were the giants who fought against Israel in Palestine.\\n[FN#5] In this wild tradition we find a confirmation of the sound\\ngeographical opinion which makes Arabia \"Une des pepinieres du genre\\nhumain\" (M. Jomard). It must be remembered that the theatre of all\\nearliest civilisation has been a fertile valley with a navigable\\nstream, like Sind, Egypt, and Mesopotamia. The existence of such a spot\\nin Arabia would have altered every page of her history; she would then\\nhave become a centre, not a source, of civilisation. Strabo\\'s Malothes\\nriver in Al-Yaman is therefore a myth. As it is, the immense population\\nof the peninsula-still thick, even in the deserts-has, from the\\nearliest ages, been impelled by drought, famine, or desire of conquest,\\nto emigrate into happier regions. All history mentions two main streams\\nwhich took their rise in the wilds. The first set to the North-East,\\nthrough Persia, Mekran, Baluchistan, Sind, and the Afghan Mountains, as\\nfar as Samarkand, Bokhara, and Tibet; the other, flowing towards the\\nNorth-West, passed through Egypt and Barbary into Etruria, Spain, the\\nIsles of the Mediterranean, and Southern France. There are two minor\\nemigrations chronicled in history, and written in the indelible\\ncharacters of physiognomy and philology. One of these set in an\\nexiguous but perennial stream towards India, especially Malabar, where,\\nmixing with the people of the country, the Arab merchants became the\\nprogenitors of the Moplah race. The other was a partial emigration,\\nalso for commercial purposes, to the coast of Berberah, in Eastern\\nAfrica, where, mixing with the Galla tribes, the people of Hazramaut\\nbecame the sires of the extensive Somali and Sawahil nations. Thus we\\nhave from Arabia four different lines of emigration, tending N.E. and\\nS.E., N.W. and S.W. At some future time I hope to develop this curious\\nbut somewhat obscure portion of Arabian history. It bears upon a most\\ninteresting subject, and serves to explain, by the consanguinity of\\nraces, the marvellous celerity with which the faith of Al-Islam spread\\nfrom the Pillars of Hercules to the confines of China-embracing part of\\nSouthern Europe, the whole of Northern and a portion of Central Africa,\\nand at least three-fourths of the continent of Asia.\\n[FN#6] Of this name M.C. de Perceval remarks, \"Le mot Arcam etait une\\ndesignation commune a tous ces rois.\" He identifies it with Rekem\\n(Numbers xxxi. 8), one of the kings of the Midianites; and recognises\\nin the preservation of the royal youth the history of Agag and Samuel.\\n[FN#7] And some most ignorantly add, \"after the entrance of Moses into\\nthe Promised Land.\"\\n[FN#8] In those days, we are told, the Jews, abandoning their original\\nsettlement in Al-Ghabbah or the low lands to the N. of the town,\\nmigrated to the highest portions of the Madinah plain on the S. and E.,\\nand the lands of the neighbourhood of the Kuba Mosque.\\n[FN#9] When describing Ohod, I shall have occasion to allude to Aaron\\'s\\ndome, which occupies the highest part. Few authorities, however,\\nbelieve that Aaron was buried there; his grave, under a small stone\\ncupola, is shown over the summit of Mount Hor, in the Sinaitic\\nPeninsula, and is much visited by devotees.\\n[FN#10] It must be remembered that many of the Moslem geographers\\nderive the word \"Arabia\" from a tract of land in the neighbourhood of\\nAl-Madinah.\\n[FN#11] Khaybar in Hebrew is supposed to signify a castle. D\\'Herbelot\\nmakes it to mean a pact or association of the Jews against the Moslems.\\nThis fort appears to be one of the latest as well as the earliest of\\nthe Hebrew settlements in Al-Hijaz. Benjamin of Tudela asserts that\\nthere were 50,000 Jews resident at their old colony, Bartema in A.D.\\n1703 found remnants of the people there, but his account of them is\\ndisfigured by fable. In Niebuhr\\'s time the Beni Khaybar had independent\\nShaykhs, and were divided into three tribes, viz., the Benu Masad, the\\nBenu Shahan, and the Benu Anizah (this latter, however, is a Moslem\\nname), who were isolated and hated by the other Jews, and therefore the\\ntraveller supposes them to have been Karaites. In Burckhardt\\'s day the\\nrace seems to have been entirely rooted out. I made many inquiries, and\\nall assured me that there is not a single Jewish family now in Khaybar.\\nIt is indeed the popular boast in Al-Hijaz, that, with the exception of\\nJeddah (and perhaps Yambu\\', where the Prophet never set his foot),\\nthere is not a town in the country harbouring an Infidel. This has now\\nbecome a point of fanatic honour; but if history may be trusted, it has\\nbecome so only lately.\\n[FN#12] When the Arabs see the ass turn tail to the wind and rain, they\\nexclaim, \"Lo! he turneth his back upon the mercy of Allah!\"\\n[FN#13] M.C. de Perceval quotes Judith, ii. 13, 26, and Jeremiah, xlix.\\n28, to prove that Holofernes, the general of Nebuchadnezzar the First,\\nlaid waste the land of Midian and other parts of Northern Arabia.\\n[FN#14] Saba in Southern Arabia.\\n[FN#15] The erection of this dyke is variously attributed to Lukman the\\nElder (of the tribe of Ad) and to Saba bin Yashjab. It burst according\\nto some, beneath the weight of a flood; according to others, it was\\nmiraculously undermined by rats. A learned Indian Shaykh has mistaken\\nthe Arabic word \"Jurad,\" a large kind of mouse or rat, for \"Jarad,\" a\\nlocust, and he makes the wall to have sunk under a \"bar i Malakh,\" or\\nweight of locusts! No event is more celebrated in the history of pagan\\nArabia than this, or more trustworthy, despite the exaggeration of the\\ndetails-the dyke is said to have been four miles long by four broad-and\\nthe fantastic marvels which are said to have accompanied its bursting.\\nThe ruins have lately been visited by M. Arnaud, a French traveller,\\nwho communicated his discovery to the French Asiatic Society in 1845.\\n[FN#16] Ma al-Sama, \"the water (or \"the splendour\") of heaven,\" is,\\ngenerally speaking, a feminine name amongst the pagan Arabs; possibly\\nit is here intended as a matronymic.\\n[FN#17] This expedition to Al-Madinah is mentioned by all the\\npre-Islamatic historians, but persons and dates are involved in the\\ngreatest confusion. Some authors mention two different expeditions by\\ndifferent Tobbas; others only one, attributing it differently, however,\\nto two Tobbas,-Abu Karb in the 3rd century of the Christian era, and\\nTobba al-Asghar, the last of that dynasty, who reigned, according to\\nsome, in A.D. 300, according to others in A.D. 448. M.C. de Perceval\\nplaces the event about A.D. 206, and asserts that the Aus and Khazraj\\ndid not emigrate to Al-Madinah before A.D. 300. The word Tobba or\\nTubba, I have been informed by some of the modern Arabs, is still used\\nin the Himyaritic dialect of Arabic to signify \"the Great\" or \"the\\nChief.\"\\n[FN#18] Nothing is more remarkable in the annals of the Arabs than\\ntheir efforts to prove the Ishmaelitic descent of Mohammed; at the same\\ntime no historic question is more open to doubt.\\n[FN#19] If this be true it proves that the Jews of Al-Hijaz had in\\nthose days superstitious reverence for the Ka\\'abah; otherwise the\\nTobba, after conforming to the law of Moses, would not have shown it\\nthis mark of respect. Moreover there is a legend that the same Rabbis\\ndissuaded the Tobba from plundering the sacred place when he was\\ntreacherously advised so to do by the Benu Hudayl Arabs. I have lately\\nperused \"The Worship of Ba\\'alim in Israel,\" based upon the work of Dr.\\nR. Dozy, \"The Israelites in Mecca.\" By Dr. H. Oort. Translated from the\\nDutch, and enlarged, with Notes and Appendices, by the Right Rev. John\\nWilliam Colenso, D.D. (Longmans.) I see no reason why Meccah or Beccah\\nshould be made to mean \"A Slaughter\"; why the Ka\\'abah should be founded\\nby the Simeonites; why the Hajj should be the Feast of Trumpets; and\\nother assertions in which everything seems to be taken for granted\\nexcept etymology, which is tortured into confession. If Meccah had been\\nfounded by the Simeonites, why did the Persians and the Hindus respect\\nit?\\n[FN#20] It is curious that Abdullah, Mohammed\\'s father, died and was\\nburied at Al-Madinah, and that his mother Aminah\\'s tomb is at Abwa, on\\nthe Madinah road. Here, too, his great-grandfather Hashim married Salma\\nAl-Mutadalliyah, before him espoused to Uhayhah, of the Aus tribe.\\nShaybah, generally called Abd al-Muttalib, the Prophet\\'s grandfather,\\nwas the son of Salma, and was bred at Al-Madinah.\\n[FN#21] Ayyas bin Ma\\'az died, it is said, a Moslem.\\n[FN#22] \"Bayat al-Akabat al-ula.\" It is so called because this oath was\\nsworn at a place called Al-Akabah (the Mountain-road), near Muna. A\\nMosque was afterwards built there to commemorate the event.\\n[FN#23] Some Moslem writers suppose that Mohammed singled out twelve\\nmen as apostles, and called them Nakil, in imitation of the example of\\nour Saviour. Other Moslems ignore both the fact and the intention. M.C.\\nde Perceval gives the names of these Nakils in vol. iii. p. 8.\\n[FN#24] Orthodox Moslems do not fail to quote this circumstance in\\nhonour of the first Caliph, upon whom moreover they bestow the title of\\n\"Friend of the Cave.\" The Shi\\'ahs, on the other hand, hating Abu Bakr,\\nsee in it a symptom of treachery, and declare that the Prophet feared\\nto let the \"Old Hyena,\" as they opprobriously term the venerable\\nsuccessor, out of his sight for fear lest he should act as spy to the\\nKuraysh. The voice of history and of common sense is against the\\nShi\\'ahs. M.C. de Perceval justly remarks, that Abu Bakr and Omar were\\nmen truly worthy of their great predecessor.\\n[FN#25] This animal\\'s name, according to some, was Al-Kaswa (\"the tips\\nof whose ears are cropped\"); according to others Al-Jada\\'a (\"one\\nmutilated in the ear, hand, nose, or lip\"). The Prophet bought her for\\n800 dirhams, on the day before his flight, from Abu Bakr, who had\\nfattened two fine animals of his own breeding. The camel was offered as\\na gift, but Mohammed insisted upon paying its price, because, say the\\nMoslem casuists, he being engaged in the work of God would receive no\\naid from man. According to M.C. de Perceval, the Prophet preached from\\nthe back of Al-Kaswa the celebrated pilgrimage sermon at Arafat on the\\n8th March, A.D. 632.\\n[FN#26] The Prophet is generally supposed to have started from Meccah\\non the first of the same month, on a Friday or a Monday. This\\ndiscrepancy is supposed to arise from the fact that Mohammed fled his\\nhouse in Meccah on a Friday, passed three days in the cave on Jabal\\nSaur, and finally left it for Al-Madinah on Monday, which therefore,\\naccording to Moslem divines, was the first day of the \"Hijrah.\" But the\\naera now commences on the 1st of the previous Muharram, an arrangement\\nmade seventeen years after the date of the flight by Omar the Caliph,\\nwith the concurrence of Ali.\\n[FN#27] The distance from Kuba to Al-Madinah is little more than three\\nmiles, for which six hours-Friday prayers being about noon-may be\\nconsidered an inordinately long time. But our author might urge as a\\nreason that the multitude of people upon a narrow road rendered the\\nProphet\\'s advance a slow one, and some historians relate that he spent\\nseveral hours in conversation with the Benu Salim.\\n[FN#28] Mohammed never would eat these strong smelling vegetables on\\naccount of his converse with the angels, even as modern \"Spiritualists\"\\nrefuse to smoke tobacco; at the same time he allowed his followers to\\ndo so, except when appearing in his presence, entering a Mosque, or\\njoining in public prayers. The pious Moslem still eats his onions with\\nthese limitations. Some sects, however, as the Wahhabis, considering\\nthem abominable, avoid them on all occasions.\\n[FN#29] The name of the tribe literally means \"sons of a carpenter\";\\nhence the error of the learned and violent Humphrey Prideaux, corrected\\nby Sale.\\n[FN#30] Some say that Abu Bakr had no abode near the Mosque. But it is\\ngenerally agreed upon, that he had many houses, one in Al-Bakia,\\nanother in the higher parts of Al-Madinah, and among them a hut on the\\nspot between the present gates called Salam and Rahmah.\\n[FN#31] It is clear from the fact above stated, that in those days the\\nJews of Arabia were in a state of excitement, hourly expecting the\\nadvent of their Messiah, and that Mohammed believed himself to be the\\nperson appointed to complete the law of Moses.\\n[FN#32] In many minor details the above differs from the received\\naccounts of Pre-Islamitic and early Mohammedan history. Let the blame\\nbe borne by the learned Shaykh Abd al-Hakk al-Muhaddis of Delhi, and\\nhis compilation, the \"Jazb al-Kulub ila Diyar al-Mahhub (the \"Drawing\\nof Hearts towards the Holy Parts\"). From the multitude of versions at\\nlast comes correctness.\\n[FN#33] A Firman from the Porte, dated 13th February, 1841, provides\\nfor the paying of these pensions regularly. \"It being customary to send\\nevery year from Egypt provisions in kind to the two Holy Cities, the\\nprovisions and other articles, whatever they may be, which have up to\\nthis time been sent to this place, shall continue to be sent thither.\"\\nFormerly the Holy Land had immense property in Egypt, and indeed in all\\nparts of Al-Islam. About thirty years ago, Mohammed Ali Pasha bought up\\nall the Wakf (church property), agreeing to pay for its produce, which\\nhe rated at five piastres the ardeb, when it was worth three times as\\nmuch. Even that was not regularly paid. The Sultan has taken advantage\\nof the present crisis to put down Wakf in Turkey. The Holy Land,\\ntherefore, will gradually lose all its land and house property, and\\nwill soon be compelled to depend entirely upon the presents of the\\npilgrims, and the Sadakah, or alms, which are still sent to it by the\\npious Moslems of distant regions. As might be supposed, both the\\nMeccans and the Madani loudly bewail their hard fates, and by no means\\napprove of the Ikram, the modern succedaneum for an extensive and\\nregularly paid revenue. At a future time, I shall recur to this subject.\\n[FN#34] The prayer-niche and the minaret both date their existence from\\nthe days of Al-Walid, the builder of the third Mosque. At this age of\\ntheir empire, the Moslems had travelled far and had seen art in various\\nlands; it is therefore not without a shadow of reason that the Hindus\\ncharge them with having borrowed their two favourite symbols, and\\ntransformed them into an arch and a tower.\\n[FN#35] The Ustawanat al-Hannanah, or \"Weeping-Post.\" See page 335,\\nchapter XVI., ante.\\n[FN#36] As usual, there are doubts about the invention of this article.\\nIt was covered with cloth by the Caliph Osman, or, as others say, by\\nAl-Mu\\'awiyah, who, deterred by a solar eclipse from carrying out his\\nproject of removing it to Damascus, placed it upon a new framework,\\nelevated six steps above the ground. Al-Mahdi wished to raise the\\nMambar six steps higher, but was forbidden so to do by the Imam Malik.\\nThe Abbasides changed the pulpit, and converted the Prophet\\'s original\\nseat into combs, which were preserved as relics. Some historians\\ndeclare that the original Mambar was burnt with the Mosque in A.H. 654.\\nIn Ibn Jubayr\\'s time (A.H. 580), it was customary for visitors to place\\ntheir right hands upon a bit of old wood, inserted into one of the\\npillars of the pulpit; this was supposed to be a remnant of the\\n\"weeping-post.\" Every Sultan added some ornament to the Mambar, and at\\none time it was made of white marble, covered over with a dome of the\\n\"eight metals.\" It is now a handsome structure, apparently of wood,\\npainted and gilt of the usual elegant form, which has been compared by\\nsome travellers with the suggesta of Roman Catholic churches. I have\\nbeen explicit about this pulpit, hoping that, next time the knotty\\nquestion of Apostolic seats comes upon the tapis, our popular authors\\nwill not confound a Curule chair with a Moslem Mambar. Of the latter\\narticle, Lane (Mod. Egyptians, chap. iii.) gave a sketch in the\\n\"Interior of a Mosque.\"\\n[FN#37] The Prophet is said to have had a dwelling-house in the\\nAmbariyah, or the Western quarter of the Manakhah suburb, and here,\\naccording to some, he lodged Mariyah, the Coptic girl. As pilgrims do\\nnot usually visit the place, and nothing of the original building can\\nbe now remaining, I did not trouble myself about it.\\n[FN#38] Meaning the Prophet\\'s fifteen to twenty-five wives. Their\\nnumber is not settled. He left nine wives and two concubines. It was\\nthis title after the Koranic order (chap, xxxiii. v. 53) which rendered\\ntheir widowhood eternal; no Arab would willingly marry a woman whom he\\nhas called mother or sister.\\n[FN#39] Authors mention a place outside the Northern wall called\\nAl-Suffah, which was assigned by Mohammed as a habitation to houseless\\nbelievers; from which circumstance these paupers derived the title of\\nAshab al-Suffah, \"Companions of the Sofa.\"\\n[FN#40] So I translate the Arabicised word \"Saj.\"\\n[FN#41] A place about five miles from Al-Madinah, on the Meccan way.\\nSee Chap. XIV.\\n[FN#42] And curious to say Al-Islam still has the largest cathedral in\\nthe world-St. Sophia\\'s at Constantinople. Next to this ranks St.\\nPeter\\'s at Rome; thirdly, I believe, the \"Jumma Masjid,\" or cathedral\\nof the old Moslem city Bijapur in India; the fourth is St. Paul\\'s,\\nLondon,\\n[FN#43] It is to this monarch that the Saracenic Mosque-architecture\\nmainly owes its present form. As will be seen, he had every advantage\\nof borrowing from Christian, Persian, and even Indian art. From the\\nfirst he took the dome, from the second the cloister-it might have been\\nnaturalised in Arabia before his time-and possibly from the third the\\nminaret and the prayer-niche. The latter appears to be a peculiarly\\nHindu feature in sacred buildings, intended to contain the idol, and to\\nsupport the lamps, flowers, and other offerings placed before it.\\n[FN#44] The reader will remember that in the sixth year of the Hijrah,\\nafter Mohammed\\'s marriage with Zaynab, his wives were secluded behind\\nthe Hijab, Pardah, or curtain. A verse of the Koran directed the\\nMoslems to converse with them behind this veil. Hence the general\\npractice of Al-Islam: now it is considered highly disgraceful in any\\nMoslem to make a Moslemah expose her face, and she will frequently\\nfound a threat upon the prejudice. A battle has been prevented by this\\nmeans, and occasionally an insurrection has been caused by it.\\n[FN#45] Amongst which some authors enumerate the goblet and the mirror\\nof Kisra.\\n[FN#46] The outer wall, built by Al-Walid, remained till A.H. 550, when\\nJamal al-Din of Isafahan, Wazir to Nur al-Din Shahid Mahmud bin Zangi,\\nsupplied its place by a grating of open sandal woodwork, or, as others\\nsay, of iron. About the same time, Sayyid Abu \\'l Hayja sent from Egypt\\na sheet of white brocade, embroidered in red silk with the chapter\\nY.S., in order to cover the inner wall. This was mounted on the\\naccession of Al-Mustazi bi\\'llah, the Caliph, after which it became the\\ncustom for every Sultan to renew the offering. And in A.H. 688, Kalaun\\nof Egypt built the outer network of brass as it now is, and surmounted\\nit with the Green Dome.\\n[FN#47] The inner wall, erected by Al-Walid, seems to have resisted the\\nfire which in A.H. 654 burnt the Mosque to the ground. Also, in A.H.\\n886, when the building was consumed by lightning, the Hujrah was spared\\nby the devouring element.\\n[FN#48] After the Prophet\\'s death and burial, Ayishah continued to\\noccupy the same room, without even a curtain between her and the tomb.\\nAt last, vexed by the crowds of visitors, she partitioned off the\\nhallowed spot with a wall. She visited the grave unveiled as long as\\nher father Abu Bakr only was placed behind the Prophet; but when Omar\\'s\\ncorpse was added, she always covered her face.\\n[FN#49] One of these, the minaret at the Bab-al-Salam, was soon\\nafterwards overthrown by Al-Walid\\'s brother Sulayman, because it shaded\\nthe house of Marwan, where he lodged during his visit to Al-Madinah in\\nthe cold season.\\n[FN#50] The dinar (denarius) was a gold piece, a ducat, a sequin.\\n[FN#51] I purpose to touch upon this event in a future chapter, when\\ndescribing my route from Al-Madinah to Meccah.\\n[FN#52] \"On this occasion,\" says Al-Samanhudi, quoted by Burckhardt,\\n\"the interior of the Hujrah was cleared, and three deep graves were\\nfound in the inside, full of rubbish, but the author of this history,\\nwho himself entered it, saw no traces of tombs.\" Yet in another place\\nhe, an eye-witness, had declared that the coffin containing the dust of\\nMohammed was cased with silver. I repeat these details.\\n[FN#53] Burckhardt has given a full account of this event in his\\nhistory of the Wahhabis.\\n[FN#54] See Chapter XVI., ante.\\n[FN#55] My predecessor estimates the whole treasury in those days to\\nhave been worth 300,000 Riyals,-a small sum, if we consider the length\\nof time during which it was accumulating. The chiefs of the town\\nappropriated 1 cwt. of golden vessels, worth at most 50,000 dollars,\\nand Sa\\'ud sold part of the plunder to Ghalib for 100,000 (I was told\\none-third more), reserving for himself about the same amount of pearls\\nand corals. Burckhardt supposes that the governors of Al-Madinah, who\\nwere often independent chiefs, and sometimes guardians of the tombs,\\nmade occasional draughts upon the generosity of the Faithful.\\n[FN#56] I inquired in vain about the substance that covered the dome.\\nSome told me it was tinfoil; others supposed it to be rivetted with\\ngreen tiles.\\n[FN#57] The Badawi calls a sound dollar \"Kirsh Hajar,\" or \"Riyal\\nHajar,\" a \"stone dollar.\"\\n[FN#58] At the same time his account is still carefully copied by our\\npopular and general authors, who, it is presumed, could easily become\\nbetter informed.\\n[FN#59] The Persians in remote times, as we learn from Herodotus (lib.\\n6), were waited upon by eunuchs, and some attribute to them the\\ninvention. Ammianus Marcellinus (lib. 14) ascribes the origin to\\nSemiramis. In Al-Islam, the employment of such persons about the Mosque\\nis a \"Bida\\'ah\" or custom unknown in the time of the Prophet. It is said\\nto have arisen from the following three considerations: 1. These people\\nare concentrated in their professions; 2. They must see and touch\\nstrange women at the shrines; and 3. The shrines are \"Harim,\" or\\nsacred, having adyta which are kept secret from the prying eyes of men,\\nand, therefore, should be served by eunuchs. It is strange that the\\nRoman Catholic church, as well as the Moslem Mosque, should have\\nadmitted such an abomination.\\n[FN#60] One of these gentry, if called \"Tawashi,\"-his generic\\nname,-would certainly insult a stranger. The polite form of address to\\none of them is \"Agha\"-Master,-in the plural \"Aghawat.\" In partibus,\\nthey exact the greatest respect from men, and the title of the Eunuch\\nof the Tomb is worth a considerable sum to them. The eunuchs of\\nAl-Madinah are more numerous and better paid than those of Meccah: they\\nare generally the slaves of rich men at Constantinople, and prefer this\\ncity on account of its climate.\\n[FN#61] The \"Sons of the City,\" however, are always allowed to do such\\nservice gratis; if, indeed, they are not paid for it.\\n[FN#62] Others told me that there were only two muftis at Al-Madinah,\\nnamely, those of the Hanafi and Shafe\\'i schools. If this be true, it\\nproves the insignificance of the followers of Malik, which personage,\\nlike others, is less known in his own town than elsewhere.\\n[FN#63] The Hanbali school is nowhere common except in Nijd, and the\\nlands Eastward as far as Al-Hasa. At present it labours under a sort of\\nimputation, being supposed to have thrown out a bad offshoot, the\\nWahhabis.\\n[FN#64] \"Ruasa\" is the plural of Rais, a chief or president. It is the\\nterm generally applied in Arabia to the captain of a vessel, and in\\nAl-Yaman it often means a barber, in virtue, I presume, of its\\nroot-Ras, the head.\\n[FN#65] Some say that the Egyptian distinction between the Imam Khatib\\nand the Imam Ratib does not obtain at Al-Madinah.\\n</p>\\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Chapter_XVIII._AL-MADINAH.\">Chapter XVIII.

AL-MADINAH.\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2><p>IT is equally difficult to define, politically and geographically, the\\nlimits of Al-Hijaz. Whilst some authors, as Abulfeda,[FN#1] fix its\\nNorthern frontier at Aylah (Fort Al-\\'Akabah) and the Desert, making\\nAl-Yaman its Southern limit, others include in it only the tract of\\nland lying between Meccah and Al-Madinah. The country has no natural\\nboundaries, and its political limits change with every generation;\\nperhaps, therefore, the best distribution of its frontier would be that\\nwhich includes all the property called Holy Land, making Yambu\\' the\\nNorthern, and Jeddah the Southern extremes, while a line drawn through\\nAl-Madinah, Suwayrkiyah, and Jabal Kora-the mountain of Taif-might\\nrepresent its Eastern boundary. Thus Al-Hijaz would be an irregular\\nparallelogram, about two hundred and fifty miles in length, with a\\nmaximum breadth of one hundred and fifty miles.\\n</p><p><br />\\nTwo meanings are assigned to the name of this venerated region. Most\\nauthorities make it mean the \"Separator,\" the \"Barrier,\" between Nijd\\nand Tahamah,[FN#2] or between Al-Yaman and Syria. According to others,\\nit signifies the \"colligated,\" i.e. by mountains. It is to be observed\\nthat the people of the country, especially the Badawin, distinguish the\\nlowlands from the high region\\n</p><p>[p.377]by different names; the former are called Tahamat al-Hijaz-the\\nsea coast of Al-Hijaz, as we should say in India, \"below the Ghauts;\"\\nthe latter is known peculiarly as Al-Hijaz.[FN#3]\\n</p><p>Madinat al-Nabi,[FN#4] the Prophet\\'s City, or, as it is\\n</p><p>[p.378]usually called for brevity, Al-Madinah, the City, is situated on\\nthe borders of Nijd, upon the vast plateau of high land\\n</p><p>[p.379] which forms central Arabia. The limits of the sanctuary called\\nthe Hudud al-Harim, as defined by the Apostle, may still serve to mark\\nout the city\\'s plain. Northwards, at a distance of about three miles,\\nis Jabal Ohod, or, according to others, Jabal Saur, a hill somewhat\\nbeyond Ohod; these are the last ribs of the vast tertiary and primitive\\nchine[FN#5] which, extending from Taurus to near Aden, and from Aden\\nagain to Maskat, fringes the Arabian trapezium. To the South-west the\\nplain is bounded by ridges of scoriaceous basalt, and by a buttress of\\nrock called Jabal Ayr, like Ohod, about three miles distant from the\\ntown. Westward, according to some authors, is the Mosque Zu\\'l-Halifah.\\nOn the East there are no natural landmarks, nor even artificial, like\\nthe \"Alamayn\" at Meccah; an imaginary line, therefore, is drawn,\\nforming an irregular circle of which the town is the centre, with a\\ndiameter from ten to twelve miles. Such is the sanctuary.[FN#6]\\nGeographically considered, the\\n</p><p>[p.380]plain is bounded, on the East, with a thin line of low dark\\nhills, traversed by the Darb al-Sharki, or the \"Eastern road,\" through\\nAl-Nijd to Meccah: Southwards, the plateau is open, and almost\\nperfectly level as far as the eye can see.\\n</p><p>Al-Madinah dates its origin doubtless from ancient times, and the cause\\nof its prosperity is evident in the abundant supply of water, a\\nnecessary generally scarce in Arabia. The formation of the plateau is\\nin some places salt sand, but usually a white chalk, and a loamy clay,\\nwhich even by the roughest manipulation makes tolerable bricks. Lime\\nalso abounds. The town is situated upon a gently-shelving part of the\\nplain, the, lowest portion of which, to judge from the versant, is at\\nthe southern base of Mount Ohod, hence called Al-Safilah, and the\\nhighest at the Awali, or plains about Kuba, and the East.\\n</p><p><br />\\nThe Southern and South-Eastern walls of the suburb are sometimes\\ncarried away by violent \"Sayl,\" or torrents, which, after rain, sweep\\ndown from the Western as\\n</p><p>[p.381]well as from the Eastern highlands. The water-flow is towards\\nAl-Ghabbah, lowlands in the Northern and Western hills, a little beyond\\nMount Ohod. This basin receives the drainage of the mountains and the\\nplain; according to some absorbing it, according to others collecting\\nit till of sufficient volume to flow off to the sea. Water, though\\nabundant, is rarely of good quality. In the days of the Prophet, the\\nMadani consumed the produce of wells, seven of which are still\\ncelebrated by the people.[FN#7] Historians relate that Omar, the second\\nCaliph, provided the town with drinking-water from the Northern parts\\nof the plains by means of an aqueduct. The modern city is supplied by a\\nsource called the Ayn al-Zarka or Azure Spring,[FN#8] which arises some\\nsay at the foot of Mount Ayr, others, with greater probability, in the\\ndate-groves of Kuba. Its waters were first brought to Al-Madinah by\\nMarwan, governor in Al-Mu\\'awiyah\\'s day. It now flows down a\\nsubterraneous canal, about thirty feet below the surface; in places the\\nwater is exposed to the air, and\\n</p><p>[p.382]steps lead to it for the convenience of the inhabitants: this\\nwas the work of Sultan Sulayman the Magnificent. After passing through\\nthe town it turns to the North-west, its course being marked by a line\\nof circular walls breast high, like the Kariz of Afghanistan, placed at\\nunequal distances, and resembling wells: it then loses itself in the\\nNakhil or palm-groves. During my stay at Al-Madinah, I always drank\\nthis water, which appeared to me, as the citizens declared it to be,\\nsweet and wholesome.[FN#9] There are many wells in the town, as water\\nis found at about twenty feet below the surface of the soil: few\\nproduce anything fit for drinking, some being salt and others bitter.\\nAs usual in the hilly countries of the East, the wide beds and\\nFiumaras, even in the dry season, will supply travellers for a day or\\ntwo with an abundance of water, filtrated through, and, in some cases,\\nflowing beneath the sand.\\n|\\n</p><p>The climate of the plain is celebrated for a long, and, comparatively\\nspeaking, a rigorous winter; a popular saying records the opinion of\\nthe Apostle \"that he who patiently endures the cold of Al-Madinah and\\nthe heat of Meccah, merits a reward in Paradise.\" Ice is not seen in\\nthe town, but may frequently be met with, it is said, on Jabal Ohod;\\nfires are lighted in the houses during winter, and palsies attack those\\nwho at this season imprudently bathe in unwarmed water. The fair\\ncomplexions of the people prove that this account of the brumal rigours\\nis not exaggerated. Chilly and violent winds from the Eastern Desert\\nare much dreaded, and though Ohod screens the town on the North and\\nNorth-East, a gap in the mountains to the North-West fills the\\n</p><p>[p.383]air at times with raw and comfortless blasts.\\tThe rains begin\\nin October, and last with considerable intervals through six months;\\nthe clouds, gathered by the hill-tops and the trees near the town,\\ndischarge themselves with violence, and about the equinoxes,\\nthunder-storms are common. At such times the Barr al-Manakhah, or the\\nopen space between the town and the suburbs, is a sheet of water, and\\nthe land near the Southern and the South-Eastern wall of the faubourg\\nbecomes a pool. Rain, however, is not considered unhealthy here; and\\nthe people, unlike the Meccans and the Cairenes, expect it with\\npleasure, because it improves their date-trees and fruit\\nplantations.[FN#10] In winter it usually rains at night, in spring\\nduring the morning, and in summer about evening time. This is the case\\nthroughout Al-Hijaz, as explained by the poet Labid in these lines,\\nwhich describe the desolate site of an old encampment:-\\n</p><p>\"It (the place) hath been fertilised by the first spring showers of the\\nconstellations, and hath been swept by\\nThe incessant torrents of the thunder-clouds, falling in heavy and\\nin gentle rains,\\n&gt;From each night-cloud, and heavily dropping morning-cloud,\\nAnd the even-cloud, whose crashings are re-echoed from around.\"\\n\"It (the place) hath been fertilised by the first spring showers of the\\nconstellations, and hath been swept by\\nThe incessant torrents of the thunder-clouds, falling in heavy and in\\ngentle rains,\\n&gt;From each night-cloud, and heavily dropping morning-cloud,\\nAnd the even-cloud, whose crashings are re-echoed from around.\"\\n</p><p>And the European reader will observe that the Arabs generally reckon\\nthree seasons, including our autumn, in their summer. The hot weather\\nat Al-Madinah appeared to me as extreme as the hibernal cold is\\ndescribed to be, but the air was dry, and the open plain prevented the\\nfaint and stagnant sultriness which distinguishes Meccah. Moreover,\\nthough the afternoons were close, the nights and the mornings were cool\\nand dewy. At this season the citizens sleep on the house-tops, or on\\nthe ground\\n</p><p>[p.384]outside their doors. Strangers must follow this example with\\nconsiderable circumspection; the open air is safe in the Desert, but in\\ncities it causes, to the unaccustomed, violent catarrhs and febrile\\naffections.\\n</p><p><br />\\nI collect the following notes upon the diseases and medical treatment\\nof the Northern Hijaz. Al-Madinah has been visited four times by the\\nRih al-Asfar[FN#11] (yellow wind), or Asiatic Cholera, which is said to\\nhave committed great ravages, sometimes carrying off whole households.\\nIn the Rahmat al-Kabirah, the \"Great Mercy,\" as the worst attack is\\npiously called, whenever a man vomited, he was abandoned to his fate;\\nbefore that, he was treated with mint, lime-juice, and copious draughts\\nof coffee. It is still the boast of Al-Madinah, that the Taun, or\\nplague, has never passed her frontier.[FN#12] The Judari, or smallpox,\\nappears to be indigenous to the countries bordering upon the Red Sea;\\nwe read of it there in the earliest works of the Arabs,[FN#13] and even\\nto the present time it sometimes sweeps through Arabia and the Somali\\n</p><p>[p.385] country with desolating violence. In the town of Al-Madinah it\\nis fatal to children, many of whom, however, are in these days\\ninoculated[FN#14]: amongst the Badawin, old men die of it, but adults\\nare rarely victims, either in the City or in the Desert. The nurse\\ncloses up the room whilst the sun is up, and carefully excludes the\\nnight air, believing that, as the disease is \"hot,[FN#15]\" a breath of\\nwind will kill the patient. During the hours of darkness, a lighted\\ncandle or lamp is always placed by the side of the bed, or the sufferer\\nwould die of madness, brought on by evil spirits or fright. Sheep\\'s\\nwool is burnt in the sick-room, as death would follow the inhaling of\\nany perfume. The only remedy I have heard of is pounded Kohl (antimony)\\ndrunk in water, and the same is drawn along the breadth of the eyelid,\\nto prevent blindness. The diet is Adas (lentils),[FN#16] and a peculiar\\nkind of date, called Tamr al-Birni. On the twenty-first day the patient\\nis washed with salt and tepid water.\\n</p><p>Ophthalmia is rare.[FN#17] In the summer, quotidian and\\n</p><p>[p.386]tertian fevers (Hummah Salis) are not uncommon, and if\\naccompanied by emetism, they are frequently fatal.\\n</p><p>[p.387]The attack generally begins with the Naffazah, or cold fit, and\\nis followed by Al-Hummah, the hot stage. The principal remedies are\\ncooling drinks, such as Sikanjabin (oxymel) and syrups. After the fever\\nthe face and body frequently swell, and indurated lumps appear on the\\nlegs and stomach. There are also low fevers, called simply Hummah; they\\nare usually treated by burning charms in the patient\\'s room. Jaundice\\nand bilious complaints are common, and the former is popularly cured in\\na peculiar way. The sick man looks into a pot full of water, whilst the\\nexorciser, reciting a certain spell, draws the heads of two needles\\nfrom the patient\\'s ears along his eyes, down his face, lastly dipping\\nthem into water, which at once becomes yellow. Others have \"Mirayat,\"\\nmagic mirrors,[FN#18] on which the patient looks, and looses the\\ncomplaint.\\n</p><p>[p.388] Dysenteries frequently occur in the fruit season, when the\\ngreedy Arabs devour all manner of unripe\\n</p><p>[p.389]peaches, grapes, and pomegranates. The popular treatment is by\\nthe actual cautery; the scientific affect the use of drastics and\\nastringent simples, and the Bizr al-Kutn (cotton-seed), toasted,\\npounded, and drunk in warm water. Almost every one here, as in Egypt,\\nsuffers more or less from haemorrhoids; they are treated by\\ndietetics-eggs and leeks-and by a variety of drugs, Myrobalans,\\nLisan-al-Hamal (Arnoglossum), etc. But the patient looks with horror at\\nthe scissors and the knife, so that they seldom succeed in obtaining a\\nradical cure. The Filaria Medinensis, locally called \"Farantit,\" is no\\nlonger common at the place which gave it its European name. At Yambu\\',\\nhowever, the people suffer much from the Vena appearing in the legs.\\nThe complaint is treated here as in India and in Abyssinia: when the\\ntumour bursts, and the worm shows, it is extracted by being gradually\\nwound round a splinter of wood. Hydrophobia is rare, and the people\\nhave many superstitions about it. They suppose that a bit of meat falls\\nfrom the sky, and that a dog eating it becomes mad. I was assured by\\nrespectable persons, that when a man is bitten, they shut him up with\\nfood, in a solitary chamber, for four days, and that if at the end of\\nthat time he still howls like a dog, they expel the Ghul (demon) from\\nhim, by pouring over him boiling water mixed with ashes-a certain cure\\nI can easily believe. The only description of leprosy known in Al-Hijaz\\nis that called \"Al-Baras\": it appears in white patches on the skin,\\nseldom attacks any but the poorer classes, and is considered incurable.\\nWounds are treated by Marham, or ointments, especially by the\\n\"Balesan,\" or Balm of Meccah; a cloth is tied round the limb, and\\n</p><p>[p.390]not removed till the wound heals, which amongst this people of\\nsimple life, generally takes place by first intention. Ulcers are\\ncommon in Al-Hijaz, as indeed all over Arabia. We read of them in\\nancient times. In A.D. 504, the poet and warrior, Amr al-Kays, died of\\nthis dreadful disease, and it is related that when Mohammed Abu Si\\nMohammed, in A.H. 132, conquered Al-Yaman with an army from Al-Hijaz,\\nhe found the people suffering from sloughing and mortifying sores, so\\nterrible to look upon that he ordered the sufferers to be burnt alive.\\nFortunately for the patients, the conqueror died suddenly before his\\ninhuman mandate was executed. These sores here, as in Al-Yaman,[FN#19]\\nare worst when upon the shin bones; they eat deep into the leg, and the\\npatient dies of fever and gangrene. They are treated on first\\nappearance by the actual cautery, and, when practicable, by cutting off\\nthe joint; the drugs popularly applied are Tutiya (tutty) and\\nverdigris. There is no cure but rest, a generous diet, and change of\\nair.\\n</p><p>By the above short account it will be seen that the Arabs are no longer\\nthe most skilful physicians in the world. They have, however, one great\\nadvantage in their practice, and they are sensible enough to make free\\nuse of it. As the children of almost all the respectable citizens are\\nbrought up in the Desert, the camp becomes to them a native village. In\\ncases of severe wounds or chronic diseases, the patient is ordered off\\nto the Black Tents, where he lives as a Badawi, drinking camels\\' milk\\n(a diet for the first three or four days highly cathartic), and doing\\nnothing. This has been the practice from time immemorial in Arabia,\\nwhereas Europe is only beginning to systematise the adhibition of air,\\nexercise, and simple living. And even now we are obliged to veil it\\nunder the garb of charlatanry-to call it a \"milk-cure\" in Switzerland,\\n</p><p>[p.391]a \"water-cure\" in Silesia, a \"grape-cure\" in France, a\\n\"hunger-cure\" in Germany, and other sensible names which act as dust in\\nthe public eyes.\\n</p><p>Al-Madinah consists of three parts,-a town, a fort, and a suburb little\\nsmaller than the body of the place. The town itself is about one-third\\nlarger than Suez, or nearly half the size of Meccah. It is a walled\\nenclosure forming an irregular oval with four gates. The Bab al-Shami,\\nor \" Syrian Gate,\" in the North-West side of the enceinte, leads\\ntowards Jabal Ohod, Hamzah\\'s burial-place, and the mountains. In the\\nEastern wall, the Bab al-Jum\\'ah, or Friday Gate, opens upon the Nijd\\nroad and the cemetery, Al-Bakia. Between the Shami and the Jum\\'ah\\ngates, towards the North, is the Bab al-Ziyafah (of Hospitality); and\\nWestwards the Bab al-Misri (Egyptian) opens upon the plain called the\\nBarr al-Manakhah. The Eastern and the Egyptian gates are fine massive\\nbuildings, with double towers close together, painted with broad bands\\nof red, yellow, and other colors, not unlike that old entrance of the\\nCairo citadel which opens upon the Ramayliyah plain. They may be\\ncompared with the gateway towers of the old Norman castles-Arques, for\\ninstance. In their shady and well-watered interiors, soldiers keep\\nguard, camel-men dispute, and numerous idlers congregate, to enjoy the\\nluxuries of coolness and of companionship. Beyond this gate, in the\\nstreet leading to the Mosque, is the great bazar. Outside it lie the\\nSuk al-Khuzayriyah, or greengrocers\\' market, and the Suk al-Habbabah,\\nor the grain bazar, with a fair sprinkling of coffee-houses. These\\nmarkets are long masses of palm-leaf huts, blackened in the sun and\\nwind, of a mean and squalid appearance, detracting greatly from the\\nappearance of the gates. Amongst them there is a little domed and\\nwhitewashed building, which I was told is a Sabil or public fountain.\\nIn the days of the Prophet the town\\n</p><p>[p.392] was not walled. Even in Al-Idrisi\\'s time (twelfth century), and\\nas late as Bartema\\'s (eighteenth century), the fortifications were\\nmounds of earth, made by order of Kasim al-Daulat al-Ghori, who\\nre-populated the town and provided for its inhabitants. Now, the\\nenceinte is in excellent condition. The walls are well built of granite\\nand lava blocks, in regular layers, cemented with lime; they are\\nprovided with \"Mazghal\" (or \"Matras\") long loopholes, and \"Shararif\" or\\ntrefoil-shaped crenelles: in order to secure a flanking fire,\\nsemicircular towers, also loopholed and crenellated, are disposed in\\nthe curtain at short and irregular intervals. Inside, the streets are\\nwhat they always should be in these torrid lands, deep, dark, and\\nnarrow, in few places paved-a thing to be deprecated-and generally\\ncovered with black earth well watered and trodden to hardness. The most\\nconsiderable lines radiate towards the Mosque. There are few public\\nbuildings. The principal Wakalahs are four in number; one is the\\nWakalat Bab Salam near the Harim, another the Wakalat Jabarti, and two\\nare inside the Misri gate; they all belong to Arab citizens. These\\nCaravanserais are used principally as stores, rarely for\\ndwelling-places like those of Cairo; travellers, therefore, must hire\\nhouses at a considerable expense, or pitch tents to the detriment of\\nhealth and to their extreme discomfort. The other public buildings are\\na few mean coffee-houses and an excellent bath in the Harat Zarawan,\\ninside the town: far superior to the unclean establishments of Cairo,\\nit borrows something from the luxury of Stambul. The houses are, for\\nthe East, well built, flat-roofed and double-storied; the materials\\ngenerally used are a basaltic scoria, burnt brick, and palm wood. The\\nbest enclose spacious courtyards and small gardens with wells, where\\nwater basins and date trees gladden the owners\\' eyes. The latticed\\nbalconies, first seen by the overland European traveller at Malta, are\\nhere common, and the windows are\\n</p><p>[p.393]mere apertures in the wall, garnished, as usual in Arab cities,\\nwith a shutter of planking. Al-Madinah fell rapidly under the Wahhabis,\\nbut after their retreat, it soon rose again, and now it is probably as\\ncomfortable and flourishing a little city as any to be found in the\\nEast. It contains between fifty and sixty streets, including the alleys\\nand culs-de-sac. There is about the same number of Harat or quarters;\\nbut I have nothing to relate of them save their names. Within the town\\nfew houses are in a dilapidated condition. The best authorities\\nestimate the number of habitations at about 1500 within the enceinte,\\nand those in the suburb at 1000. I consider both accounts exaggerated;\\nthe former might contain 800, and the Manakhah perhaps 500; at the same\\ntime I must confess not to have counted them, and Captain Sadlier (in\\nA.D. 1819) declares that the Turks, who had just made a kind of census,\\nreckoned 6000 houses and a population of 18,000 souls. Assuming the\\npopulation to be 16,000 (Burckhardt raises it as high as 20,000), of\\nwhich 9000 occupy the city, and 7000 the suburbs and the fort, this\\nwould give a little more than twelve inhabitants to each house, a fair\\nestimate for an Arab town, where the abodes are large and slaves\\nabound.[FN#20]\\n</p><p>The castle joins on to the North-West angle of the city enceinte, and\\nthe wall of its Eastern outwork is pierced for\\n</p><p>[p.394]a communication through a court strewed with guns and warlike\\napparatus, between the Manakhah Suburb and the Bab al-Shami, or the\\nSyrian Gate. Having been refused entrance into the fort, I can describe\\nonly its exterior. The outer wall resembles that of the city, only its\\ntowers are more solid, and the curtain appears better calculated for\\nwork. Inside, a donjon, built upon a rock, bears proudly enough the\\nbanner of the Crescent and the Star; its whitewashed walls make it a\\nconspicuous object, and guns pointed in all directions, especially upon\\nthe town, project from their embrasures. The castle is said to contain\\nwells, bomb-proofs, provisions, and munitions of war; if so, it must be\\na kind of Gibraltar to the Badawin and the Wahhabis. The garrison\\nconsisted of a Nisf Urtah,[FN#21] or half battalion (four hundred men)\\nof Nizam infantry, commanded by a Pasha; his authority also extends to\\na Sanjak, or about five hundred Kurdish and Albanian Bash-Buzuks, whose\\nduty it is to escort caravans, to convey treasures, and to be shot at\\nin the Passes. The Madani, who, as usual with Orientals, take a\\npersonal pride in their castle, speak of it with much exaggeration.\\nCommanded by a high line of rocks on the North-West, and built as it is\\nin most places without moat, glacis, earthwork, or outworks, a few\\nshells and a single battery of siege guns would soon render it\\nuntenable. In ancient times it has more than once been held by a party\\nat feud with the town, for whose mimic battles the Barr al-Manakhah was\\na fitting field. Northward from the fort, on the road to Ohod, but\\nstill within fire, is a long many-windowed building, formerly Da\\'ud\\nPasha\\'s palace. In my time it had been bought by Abbas Pasha of Egypt.\\n</p><p>[p.395]The suburbs lie to the South and West of the town. Southwards\\nthey are separated from the enceinte by a wide road, called the Darb\\nal-Janazah, the Road of Biers, so called because the corpses of certain\\nschismatics, who may not pass through the city, are carried this way to\\ntheir own cemetery near the Bab al-Jumah, or Eastern Gate. Westwards,\\nbetween Al-Madinah and its faubourg, lies the plain of Al-Manakhah,\\nabout three-quarters of a mile long, by three hundred yards broad. The\\nstraggling suburbs occupy more ground than the city: fronting the\\nenceinte they are without walls; towards the West, where open country\\nlies, they are enclosed by mud or raw brick ramparts, with little round\\ntowers, all falling to decay. A number of small gates lead from the\\nsuburb into the country. The only large one, a poor copy of the Bab\\nal-Nasr at Cairo, is the Ambari or Western entrance, through which we\\npassed into Al-Madinah. The suburb contains no buildings of any\\nconsequence, except the Khaskiyah, or official residence of the Muhafiz\\n(governor), a plain building near the Barr al-Manakhah, and the Khamsah\\nMasajid, or the Five Mosques, which every Zair is expected to visit.\\nThey are\\n</p><p>The Prophet\\'s Mosque in the Manakhah.\\nAbu Bakr\\'s near the Ayn al-Zarka.\\nAli\\'s Mosque in the Zukak al-Tayyar of the Manakhah. Some authors call\\nthis the \"Musalla al-Id,\" because the Prophet here prayed the Festival\\nPrayer.\\nOmar\\'s Mosque, near the Bab Kuba of the Manakhah, and close to the\\nlittle torrent called Al-Sayh.\\nBelal\\'s Mosque, celebrated in books; I did not see it, and some Madani\\nassured me that it no longer exists.\\n</p><p>A description of one of these buildings will suffice, for they are all\\nsimilar. Mohammed\\'s Mosque in the Manakhah stands upon a spot formerly\\noccupied, some say, by the Jami Ghamamah. Others believe it to be\\nfounded upon the Musalla al-Nabi, a place where the\\n</p><p>[p.396]Apostle recited the first Festival prayers after his arrival at\\nAl-Madinah, and used frequently to pray, and to address those of his\\nfollowers who lived far from the Harim,[FN#22] or Sanctuary. It is a\\ntrim modern building of cut stone and lime in regular layers, of\\nparallelogramic shape, surmounted by one large and four small cupolas.\\nThese are all whitewashed; and the principal is capped with a large\\ncrescent, or rather a trident, rising from a series of gilt globes: the\\nother domes crown the several corners. The minaret is of the usual\\nTurkish shape, with a conical roof, and a single gallery for the\\nMu\\'ezzin. An Acacia-tree or two on the Eastern side, and behind it a\\nwall-like line of mud houses, finish the coup-d\\'oeil; the interior of\\nthis building is as simple as is the exterior. And here I may remark\\nthat the Arabs have little idea of splendour, either in their public or\\nin their private architecture. Whatever strikes the traveller\\'s eye in\\nAl-Hijaz is always either an importation or the work of foreign\\nartists. This arises from the simple tastes of the people, combined,\\ndoubtless, with their notable thriftiness. If strangers will build for\\nthem, they argue, why should they build for themselves? Moreover, they\\nhave scant inducement to lavish money upon grand edifices. Whenever a\\ndisturbance takes place, domestic or from without, the principal\\nbuildings are sure to suffer. And the climate is inimical to their\\nenduring. Both ground and air at Al-Madinah, as well as at Meccah, are\\ndamp and nitrous in winter, in summer dry and torrid: the lime is poor;\\npalm-timber soon decays: even foreign wood-work suffers, and a few\\nyears of neglect suffice to level the proudest pile with the dust.\\n</p><p>The suburbs to the South of Al- Madinah are a collection\\n</p><p>[p.397]of walled villages, with plantations and gardens between. They\\nare laid out in the form, called here, as in Egypt, Hosh-court-yards,\\nwith single-storied tenements opening into them. These enclosures\\ncontain the cattle of the inhabitants; they have strong wooden doors,\\nshut at night to prevent \"lifting,\" and they are capable of being\\nstoutly defended. The inhabitants of the suburb are for the most part\\nBadawi settlers, and a race of schismatics who will be noticed in\\nanother chapter. Beyond these suburbs, to the South, as well as to the\\nNorth and Northeast, lie gardens and extensive plantations of\\npalm-trees.\\n</p><p>[FN#1] To the East he limits Al-Hijaz by Yamamah (which some include in\\nit), Nijd, and the Syrian desert, and to the West by the Red Sea. The\\nGreeks, not without reason, included it in their Arabia Petraea.\\nNiebuhr places the Southern boundary at Hali, a little town south of\\nKunfudah (Gonfoda). Captain Head (Journey from India to Europe) makes\\nthe village Al-Kasr, opposite the Island of Kotambul, the limit of\\nAl-Hijaz to the South.\\n[FN#2] Or, according to others, between Al-Yaman and Syria.\\n[FN#3] If you ask a Badawi near Meccah, whence his fruit comes, he will\\nreply \"min Al-Hijaz,\" \"from the Hijaz,\" meaning from the mountainous\\npart of the country about Taif. This would be an argument in favour of\\nthose who make the word to signify a \"place tied together,\" (by\\nmountains). It is notorious that the Badawin are the people who best\\npreserve the use of old and disputed words; for which reason they were\\nconstantly referred to by the learned in the palmy days of Moslem\\nphilology. \"Al-Hijaz,\" also, in this signification, well describes the\\ncountry, a succession of ridges and mountain chains; whereas such a\\nname as \"the barrier\" would appear to be rather the work of some\\ngeographer in his study. Thus Al-Nijd was so called from its high and\\nopen lands, and, briefly, in this part of the world, names are most\\nfrequently derived from some physical and material peculiarity of soil\\nor climate.\\n[FN#4] Amongst a people, who, like the Arabs or the Spaniards, hold a\\nplurality of names to be a sign of dignity, so illustrious a spot as\\nAl-Madinah could not fail to be rich in nomenclature. A Hadis declares,\\n\"to Al-Madinah belong ten names\": books, however, enumerate nearly a\\nhundred, of which a few will suffice as a specimen. Tabah, Tibah,\\nTaibah, Tayyibah, and Mutayyibah, (from the root \"Tib,\" \"good,\"\\n\"sweet,\" or \"lawful,\") allude to the physical excellencies of\\nAl-Madinah as regards climate-the perfume of the Prophet\\'s tomb, and of\\nthe red rose, which was a thorn before it blossomed by the sweat of his\\nbrow-and to its being free from all moral impurity, such as the\\npresence of Infidels, or worshippers of idols. Mohammed declared that\\nhe was ordered by Allah to change the name of the place to Tabah, from\\nYasrib or Asrib. The latter, according to some, was a proper name of a\\nson of Noah; others apply it originally to a place west of Mount Ohod,\\nnot to Al-Madinah itself; and quote the plural form of the word,\\n\"Asarib,\" (\"spots abounding in palms and fountains,\") as a proof that\\nit does not belong exclusively to a person. However this may be, the\\ninauspicious signification of Yasrib, whose root is \"Sarab,\"\\n(destruction,) and the notorious use of the name by the Pagan Arabs,\\nhave combined to make it, like the other heathen designation,\\nAl-Ghalabah, obsolete, and the pious Moslem who pronounces the word is\\ncareful to purify his mouth by repeating ten times the name\\n\"Al-Madinah.\" Barah and Barrah allude to its obedience and purity;\\nHasunah to its beauty; Khayrah and Khayyarah to its goodness; Mahabbah,\\nHabibah and Mahbubah, to the favour it found in the eyes of the\\nProphet; whilst Jabirah, Jabbarah, and Jabarah, (from the root Jabr,\\njoining or breaking), at once denote its good influence upon the\\nfortunes of the Faithful and its evil effects upon the Infidel.\\n\"Al-Iman,\" (the Faith,) is the name under which it is hinted at in the\\nKoran. It is called Shafiyah (the Healer), on account of the curative\\neffects of earth found in its neighbourhood; Nasirah, the Saving, and\\nAsimah, the Preserving, because Mohammed and his companions were there\\nsecure from the fury of their foes; Fazihah, the Detector, from its\\nexposing the Infidel and the hypocrite; Muslimah and Muminah, the\\nFaithful City; Mubarakah, the Blessed; Mahburah, the Happy; and\\nMahturah, the Gifted. Mahrusah, the Guarded; and Mahfuzah, the\\nPreserved, allude to the belief that an angel sits in each of its ten\\nmain streets, to watch over the town, and to prevent \"Antichrist\"\\nentering therein. \"Al-Dajjal,\" as this personage is called, will arise\\nin the East and will peregrinate the earth; but he will be unable to\\npenetrate into Meccah; and on approaching Jabal Ohod, in sight of\\nAl-Madinah, he will turn off towards his death-place, Al-Sham\\n(Damascus). In the Taurat or Pentateuch, the town is called Mukaddasah,\\nthe Holy, or Marhumah the Pitied, in allusion to the mission of\\nMohammed; Marzukah, the Fed, is a favourable augury of plenty to it,\\nand Miskinah, the Poor, hints that it is independent of treasure of\\ngold or store of silver to keep up its dignity. Al-Makarr, means the\\nResidence or the Place of Quiet; Makinat, the Firmly-fixed, (in the\\nright faith); Al-Harim, the Sacred or Inviolable; and, finally,\\nAl-Balad, the Town, and Al-Madinah, the City by excellence. So an\\ninhabitant calls himself Al-Madani, whilst the natives of other and\\nless-favoured \"Madinahs\" affix Madini to their names. Its titles are\\nArz-Allah, Allah\\'s Land; Arz al-Hijrah, the Land of Exile; Akkalat\\nal-Buldan, the Eater of Towns; and Akkalat al-Kura, the Eater of\\nVillages, on account of its superiority, even as Meccah is entitled Umm\\nal-Kura, the Mother of Villages; Bayt Rasul Allah, House of Allah\\'s\\nProphet; Jazirat alArab, Isle of the Arab; and Harim Rasul Allah, the\\nSanctuary of Allah\\'s Prophet. In books and letters it has sometimes the\\ntitle of Madinah Musharrafah, the Exalted; more often that of Madinah\\nMunawwarah, the Enlightened-scil. by the lamp of faith and the column\\nof light supposed to be based upon the Prophet\\'s tomb. The Moslems are\\nnot the only people who lay claim to Al-Madinah. According to some\\nauthors-and the legend is more credible than at first sight it would\\nappear-the old Guebres had in Arabia and Persia seven large fire\\ntemples, each dedicated to a planet. At \"Mahdinah,\" as they pervert the\\nword, was an image of the Moon, wherefore the place was originally\\ncalled the \"Religion of the Moon.\" These Guebres, amongst other sacred\\nspots, claim Meccah, where they say Saturn and the Moon were conjointly\\nvenerated; Jerusalem, the Tomb of Ali at Najaf, that of Hosayn at\\nKerbela, and others. These pretensions of course the Moslems deny with\\ninsistance, which does not prevent certain symptoms of old and decayed\\nfaith peeping out in localities where their presence, if duly\\nunderstood, would be considered an abomination. This curious fact is\\nabundantly evident in Sind, and I have already alluded to it (History\\nof Sind).\\n[FN#5] Such is its formation in Al-Hijaz.\\n[FN#6] Within the sanctuary all Muharramat, or sins, are forbidden; but\\nthe several schools advocate different degrees of strictness. The Imam\\nMalik, for instance, allows no latrinae} nearer to Al-Madinah than\\nJabal Ayr, a distance of about three miles. He also forbids slaying\\nwild animals, but at the same time he specifies no punishment for the\\noffence. Some do not allow the felling of trees, alleging that the\\nProphet enjoined their preservation as an ornament to the city, and a\\npleasure to visitors. Al-Khattabi, on the contrary, permits people to\\ncut wood, and this is certainly the general practice. All authors\\nstrenuously forbid within the boundaries slaying man (except invaders,\\ninfidels, and the sacrilegious), drinking spirits, and leading an\\nimmoral life. As regards the dignity of the sanctuary, there is but one\\nopinion; a number of Hadis testify to its honour, praise its people,\\nand threaten dreadful things to those who injure it or them. It is\\ncertain that on the last day, the Prophet will intercede for, and aid,\\nall those who die, and are buried, at Al-Madinah. Therefore, the Imam\\nMalik made but one pilgrimage to Meccah, fearing to leave his bones in\\nany other cemetery but Al-Bakia. There is, however, much debate\\nconcerning the comparative sanctity of Al-Madinah and Meccah. Some say\\nMohammed preferred the former, blessing it as Abraham did Meccah.\\nMoreover, as a tradition declares that every man\\'s body is drawn from\\nthe dust of the ground in which he is buried, Al-Madinah, it is\\nevident, had the honour of supplying materials for the Prophet\\'s\\nperson. Others, like Omar, were uncertain in favour of which city to\\ndecide. Others openly assert the pre-eminence of Meccah; the general\\nconsensus of Al-Islam preferring Al-Madinah to Meccah, save only the\\nBayt Allah in the latter city. This last is a juste-milieu view, by no\\nmeans in favour with the inhabitants of either place. In the meanwhile\\nthe Meccans claim unlimited superiority over the Madani; the Madani\\nover the Meccans.\\n[FN#7] These seven wells will be noticed in Chapter XIX., post.\\n[FN#8] I translate Al-Zarka \"azure,\" although Sir G. Wilkinson remarks,\\napropos of the Bahr al-Azrak, generally translated by us the \"Blue\\nNile,\" that, \"when the Arabs wish to say dark or jet black, they use\\nthe word \\xef\\xbf\\xbdAzrak.\\'\" It is true that Azrak is often applied to\\nindeterminate dark hues, but \"Aswad,\" not Azrak, is the opposite to\\nAbyaz, \"white.\" Moreover, Al-Zarka in the feminine is applied to women\\nwith light blue eyes; this would be no distinctive appellation if it\\nsignified black eyes, the almost universal colour. Zarka of Yamamah is\\nthe name of a celebrated heroine in Arab story, and the curious reader,\\nwho wishes to see how much the West is indebted to the East, even for\\nthe materials of legend, will do well to peruse her short history in\\nMajor Price\\'s \"Essay,\" or M.C. de Perceval\\'s \"Essai,\" &amp;c., vol. i., p.\\n101. Both of these writers, however, assert that Zarka\\'s eyes, when cut\\nout, were found to contain fibres blackened by the use of Kohl, and\\nthey attribute to her the invention of this pigment. I have often heard\\nthe legend from the Arabs, who declare that she painted her eyes with\\n\"Ismid,\" a yellow metal, of what kind I have never been able to\\ndetermine, although its name is everywhere known.\\n[FN#9] Burckhardt confounds the Ayn al-Zarka with the Bir al-Khatim, or\\nKuba well, of whose produce the surplus only mixes with it, and he\\ncomplains loudly of the \"detestable water of Madinah.\" But he was ill\\nat the time, otherwise he would not have condemned it so strongly after\\neulogising the salt-bitter produce of the Meccan Zemzem.\\n[FN#10] The people of Nijd, as Wallin informs us, believe that the more\\nthe palms are watered, the more syrup will the fruit produce; they\\ntherefore inundate the ground, as often as possible. At Al-Jauf, where\\nthe date is peculiarly good, the trees are watered regularly every\\nthird or fourth day.\\n[FN#11] Properly meaning the Yellow Wind or Air. The antiquity of the\\nword and its origin are still disputed.\\n[FN#12] Burckhardt (Travels in Arabia, vol. ii.) informs us, that in\\nA.D. 1815, when Meccah, Yambu\\', and Jeddah suffered severely from the\\nplague, Al-Madinah and the open country between the two seaports\\nescaped.\\n[FN#13] Conjecture, however, goes a little too far when it discovers\\nsmall-pox in the Tayr Ababil, the \"swallow birds,\" which, according to\\nthe Koran, destroyed the host of Abrahat al-Ashram. Major Price (Essay)\\nmay be right in making Ababil the plural of Abilah, a vesicle; but it\\nappears to me that the former is an Arabic and the latter a Persian\\nword, which have no connection whatever. M.C. de Perceval, quoting the\\nSirat al-Rasul, which says that at that time small-pox first appeared\\nin Arabia, ascribes the destruction of the host of Al-Yaman to an\\nepidemic and a violent tempest. The strangest part of the story is,\\nthat although it occurred at Meccah, about two months before Mohammed\\'s\\nbirth, and, therefore, within the memory of many living at the time,\\nthe Prophet alludes to it in the Koran as a miracle.\\n[FN#14] In Al-Yaman, we are told by Niebuhr, a rude form of\\ninoculation-the mother pricking the child\\'s arm with a thorn-has been\\nknown from time immemorial. My Madinah friend assured me that only\\nduring the last generation, this practice has been introduced amongst\\nthe Badawin of Al-Hijaz.\\n[FN#15] Orientals divide their diseases, as they do remedies and\\narticles of diet, into hot, cold, and temperate.\\n</p><p>[FN#16] This grain is cheaper than rice on the banks of the Nile-a fact\\nwhich enlightened England, now paying a hundred times its value for\\n\"Revalenta Arabica,\" apparently ignores.\\n[FN#17] Herodotus (Euterpe) has two allusions to eye disease, which\\nseems to have afflicted the Egyptians from the most ancient times.\\nSesostris the Great died stone-blind; his successor lost his sight for\\nten years, and the Hermaic books had reason to devote a whole volume to\\nophthalmic disease. But in the old days of idolatry, the hygienic and\\nprophylactic practices alluded to by Herodotus, the greater cleanliness\\nof the people, and the attention paid to the canals and drainage,\\nprobably prevented this malarious disease becoming the scourge which it\\nis now. The similarity of the soil and the climate of Egypt to those of\\nUpper Sind, and the prevalence of the complaint in both countries,\\nassist us in investigating the predisposing causes. These are, the\\nnitrous and pungent nature of the soil-what the old Greek calls \"acrid\\nmatter exuding from the earth,\"-and the sudden transition from extreme\\ndryness to excessive damp checking the invisible perspiration of the\\ncircumorbital parts, and flying to an organ which is already weakened\\nby the fierce glare of the sun, and the fine dust raised by the Khamsin\\nor the Chaliho. Glare and dust alone, seldom cause eye disease.\\nEveryone knows that ophthalmia is unknown in the Desert, and the people\\nof Al-Hijaz, who live in an atmosphere of blaze and sand, seldom lose\\ntheir sight. The Egyptian usually catches ophthalmia in his childhood.\\nIt begins with simple conjunctivitis, caused by constitutional\\npredisposition, exposure, diet, and allowing the eye to be covered with\\nswarms of flies. He neglects the early symptoms, and cares the less for\\nbeing a Cyclops, as the infirmity will most probably exempt him from\\nmilitary service. Presently the sane organ becomes affected\\nsympathetically. As before, simple disease of the conjunctiva passes\\ninto purulent ophthalmia. The man, after waiting a while, will go to\\nthe doctor and show a large cicatrix in each eye, the result of an\\nulcerated cornea. Physic can do nothing for him; he remains blind for\\nlife. He is now provided for, either by living with his friends, who\\nseldom refuse him a loaf of bread, or if industriously inclined, by\\nbegging, by acting Mu\\'ezzin, or by engaging himself as \"Yamaniyah,\" or\\nchaunter, at funerals. His children are thus predisposed to the\\npaternal complaint, and gradually the race becomes tender-eyed. Most\\ntravellers have observed that imported African slaves seldom become\\nblind either in Egypt or in Sind. Few Englishmen settled in Egypt lose\\ntheir sight, except they be medical men, who cannot afford time to\\nnurse the early symptoms. The use of coffee and of water as beverages\\nhas much to do with this. In the days of hard drinking our Egyptian\\narmy suffered severely, and the Austrian army in Tuscany showed how\\noften blindness is caused by importing Northern habits into Southern\\ncountries. Many Europeans in Egypt wash their eyes with cold water,\\nespecially after walking, and some use once a day a mildly astringent\\nor cooling wash, as Goulard\\'s lotion or vinegar and water. They avoid\\nletting flies settle upon their eyes, and are of opinion that the\\nevening dews are prejudicial, and that sleeping with open windows lays\\nthe foundation of disease. Generally when leaving a hot room,\\nespecially a Nile-boat cabin, for the cold damp night air, the more\\nprudent are careful to bathe and to wipe the eyes and forehead as a\\npreparation for change of atmosphere. During my short practice in Egypt\\nI found the greatest advantage from the employment of\\ncounter-irritants,-blisters and Pommade Emetise,-applied to the temples\\nand behind the ears. Native practitioners greatly err by confining\\ntheir patients in dark rooms, thereby injuring the general health and\\nlaying the foundation of chronic disease. They are ignorant that,\\nunless the optic nerve be affected, the stimulus of light is beneficial\\nto the eye. And the people by their dress favour the effects of glare\\nand dust. The Tarbush, no longer surrounded as of old by a huge\\nturband, is the least efficient of protectors, and the comparative\\nrarity of ophthalmic disease among the women, who wear veils, proves\\nthat the exposure is one of its co-efficient causes.\\n[FN#18] This invention dates from the most ancient times, and both in\\nthe East and in the West has been used by the weird brotherhood to\\nproduce the appearances of the absent and the dead, to discover\\ntreasure, to detect thieves, to cure disease, and to learn the secrets\\nof the unknown world. The Hindus called it Anjan, and formed it by\\napplying lamp-black, made of a certain root, and mixed with oil to the\\npalm of a footling child, male or female. The Greeks used oil poured\\ninto a boy\\'s hand. Cornelius Agrippa had a crystal mirror, which\\nmaterial also served the Counts de Saint Germain and Cagliostro. Dr.\\nDee\\'s \"show-stone\" was a bit of cannel coal. The modern Sindians know\\nthe art by the name of Gahno or Vinyano; there, as in Southern Persia,\\nink is rubbed upon the seer\\'s thumb-nail. The people of Northern Africa\\nare considered skilful in this science, and I have a Maghrabi magic\\nformula for inking the hand of a \"boy, a black slave girl, a virgin, or\\na pregnant woman,\" which differs materially from those generally known.\\nThe modern Egyptians call it Zarb al-Mandal, and there is scarcely a\\nman in Cairo who does not know something about it. In selecting\\nsubjects to hold the ink, they observe the right hand, and reject all\\nwho have not what is called in palmistry the \"linea media naturalis\"\\nstraight and deeply cut. Even the barbarous Finns look into a glass of\\nbrandy, and the natives of Australia gaze at a kind of shining stone.\\nLady Blessington\\'s crystal ball is fresh in the memory of the present\\ngeneration, and most men have heard of Electro-Biology and the Cairo\\nmagician. Upon this latter subject, a vexed one, I must venture a few\\nremarks. In the first account of the magician by Mr. Lane, we have a\\nfair and dispassionate recital of certain magical, mystical, or\\nmesmeric phenomena, which \"excited considerable curiosity and interest\\nth[r]oughout the civilised world.\" As usual in such matters, the\\ncivilised world was wholly ignorant of what was going on at home;\\notherwise, in London, Paris, and New York, they might have found dozens\\nstudying the science. But a few years before, Dr. Herklots had\\ndescribed the same practice in India, filling three goodly pages; but\\nhe called his work \"Qanoon-i-Islam,\" and, consequently, despite its\\nexcellencies, it fell still-born from the press. Lady H. Stanhope\\nfrequently declared \"the spell by which the face of an absent person is\\nthrown upon a mirror to be within the reach of the humblest and most\\ncontemptible of magicians;\" but the civilised world did not care to\\nbelieve a prophetess. All, however, were aroused by Mr. Lane\\'s\\ndiscovery, and determined to decide the question by the ordeal of\\nreason. Accordingly, in A.D. 1844, Mr. Lane, aided by Lord Nugent and\\nothers, discovered that a \"coarse and stupid fraud\" had been\\nperpetrated upon him by Osman Effendi, the Scotchman. In 1845, Sir G.\\nWilkinson remarked of this rationalism, \"The explanation lately\\noffered, that Osman Effendi was in collusion with the magician, is\\nneither fair on him nor satisfactory, as he was not present when those\\ncases occurred which were made so much of in Europe,\" and he proposed\\n\"leading questions and accidents\" as the word of the riddle. Eothen\\nattributed the whole affair to \"shots,\" as schoolboys call them, and\\nranked success under the head of Paley\\'s \"tentative miracles.\" A writer\\nin the Quarterly explained them by suggesting the probability of divers\\n(impossible) optical combinations, and, lest the part of belief should\\nhave been left unrepresented, Miss Martineau was enabled to see clear\\nsigns of mesmeric action, and by the decisive experiment of self,\\ndiscovered the magic to be an \"affair of mesmerism.\" Melancholy to\\nrelate, after all this philosophy, the herd of travellers at Cairo is\\nstill divided in opinion about the magician, some holding his\\nperformance to be \"all humbug,\" others darkly hinting that \"there may\\nbe something in it.\"\\n[FN#19] They distinguish, however, between the Hijaz \"Nasur\" and the\\n\"Jurh al-Yamani,\" or the \"Yaman Ulcer.\"\\n[FN#20] I afterwards received the following information from Mr.\\nCharles Cole, H.B.M. Vice-Consul at Jeddah, a gentleman well acquainted\\nwith Western Arabia, and having access to official information: \"The\\npopulation of Al-Madinah is from 16,000 to 18,000, and the Nizam troops\\nin garrison 400. Meccah contains about 45,000 inhabitants, Yambu\\' from\\n6000 to 7000, Jeddah about 2500 (this I think is too low), and Taif\\n8000. Most of the troops are stationed at Meccah and at Jeddah. In\\nAl-Hijaz there is a total force of five battalions, each of which ought\\nto contain 800 men; they may amount to 3500, with 500 artillery, and\\n4500 irregulars, though the muster rolls bear 6000. The Government pays\\nin paper for all supplies, (even for water for the troops,) and the\\npaper sells at the rate of forty piastres per cent.\"\\n[FN#21] The Urtah or battalion here varies from 800 to 1000 men. Of\\nthese, four form one Alai or regiment, and thirty-six Alai an Urdu or\\ncamp. This word Urdu, pronounced \"Ordoo,\" is the origin of our \"horde.\"\\n[FN#22] One of the traditions, \"Between my house and my place of\\nprayers is a Garden of the Gardens of Paradise,\" has led divines to\\nmeasure the distance: it is said to be 1000 cubits from the Bab Salam\\nof the Harim to this Musalla.\\n</p>\\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Chapter_XIX._A_RIDE_TO_THE_MOSQUE_OF_KUBA.\">Chapter XIX.

A RIDE TO THE MOSQUE OF KUBA.\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2><p>THE principal places of pious visitation in the vicinity of Al-Madinah\\nare the Mosques of Kuba, the Cemetery Al-Bakia, and the martyr Hamzah\\'s\\ntomb, at the foot of Mount Ohod. These the Zair is directed by all the\\nOlema to visit, and on the holy ground to pray Allah for a blessing\\nupon himself, and upon his brethren of the faith.\\n</p><p>Early one Saturday morning, I started for Kuba with a motley crowd of\\ndevotees. Shaykh Hamid, my Muzawwir, was by my side, mounted upon an\\nass more miserable than I had yet seen. The boy Mohammed had procured\\nfor me a Meccan dromedary, with splendid trappings, a saddle with\\nburnished metal peaks before and behind, covered with a huge sheepskin\\ndied crimson, and girthed over fine saddle-bags, whose enormous tassels\\nhung almost to the ground. The youth himself, being too grand to ride a\\ndonkey, and unable to borrow a horse, preferred walking. He was proud\\nas a peacock, being habited in a style somewhat resembling the plume of\\nthat gorgeous bird, in the coat of many colours-yellow, red, and golden\\nflowers, apparently sewed on a field of bright green silk-which cost me\\nso dear in the Harim. He was armed, as indeed all of us were, in\\nreadiness for the Badawin, and he anxiously awaited opportunities of\\ndischarging his pistol. Our course lay from Shaykh Hamid\\'s house in the\\nManakhah, along and up the\\n</p><p>[p.399]Fiumara, \"Al-Sayh,\" and through the Bab Kuba, a little gate in\\nthe suburb wall, where, by-the-bye, my mounted companion was nearly\\ntrampled down by a rush of half-wild camels. Outside the town, in this\\ndirection, Southward, is a plain of clay, mixed with chalk, and here\\nand there with sand, whence protrude blocks and little ridges of\\nbasalt. As far as Kuba, and the Harrah ridge to the West, the earth is\\nsweet and makes excellent gugglets.[FN#1] Immediately outside the gate\\nI saw a kiln, where they were burning tolerable bricks. Shortly after\\nleaving the suburb, an Indian, who joined our party upon the road,\\npointed out on the left of the way what he declared was the place of\\nthe celebrated Khandak, or Moat, the Torres Vedras of Arabian\\nHistory.[FN#2] Presently the Nakhil, or palm plantations, began.\\nNothing lovelier to the eye, weary with hot red glare, than the rich\\ngreen waving crops and the cool shade, the \"food of vision,\" as the\\nArabs call it, and \"pure water to the parched throat.\" For hours I\\ncould have sat and looked at it. The air was soft and balmy; a perfumed\\nbreeze, strange luxury in Al-Hijaz, wandered amongst the date fronds;\\nthere were fresh flowers and bright foliage; in fact, at Midsummer,\\nevery beautiful feature of Spring. Nothing more delightful to the ear\\nthan the warbling of the small birds, that sweet familiar sound; the\\nsplashing of tiny cascades from the wells into the wooden troughs,\\n</p><p>[p.400]and the musical song of the water-wheels. Travellers-young\\ntravellers-in the East talk of the \"dismal grating,\" the \"mournful\\nmonotony,\" and the \"melancholy creaking of these dismal machines.\" To\\nthe veteran wanderer their sound is delightful from association,\\nreminding him of fields and water-courses, and hospitable villages, and\\nplentiful crops. The expatriated Nubian, for instance, listens to the\\nwater-wheel with as deep emotion as the Ranz des Vaches ever excited in\\nthe hearts of Switzer mercenary at Naples, or \"Lochaber no more,\" among\\na regiment of Highlanders in the West Indies. The date-trees of\\nAl-Madinah merit their celebrity. Their stately columnar stems, here,\\nseems higher than in other lands, and their lower fronds are allowed to\\ntremble in the breeze without mutilation.[FN#3] These enormous palms\\nwere loaded with ripening fruits; and the clusters, carefully tied up,\\nmust often have weighed upwards of eighty pounds. They hung down\\nbetween the lower branches by a bright yellow stem, as thick as a man\\'s\\nankle. Books enumerate a hundred and thirty-nine varieties of trees; of\\nthese between sixty and seventy are well known, and each is\\ndistinguished, as usual among Arabs, by its peculiar name. The best\\nkind is Al-Shelebi; it is packed in skins, or in flat round boxes\\ncovered with paper, somewhat in the manner of French prunes, and sent\\nas presents to the remotest parts of the Moslem world.[FN#4] The fruit\\nis about two inches long, with a small stone,\\n</p><p>[p.401]and has a peculiar aromatic flavour and smell; it is seldom\\neaten by the citizens on account of the price, which varies from two to\\nten piastres the pound. The tree, moreover, is rare, and is said to be\\nnot so productive as the other species. The Ajwah[FN#5] date is eaten,\\nbut not sold, because a tradition of the Prophet declares, that whoso\\nbreaketh his fast every day with six or seven of these fruits, need\\nfear neither poison nor magic. The third kind, Al-Hilwah, also a large\\ndate, derives a name from its exceeding sweetness: of this palm the\\nMoslems relate that the Prophet planted a stone, which in a few minutes\\ngrew up and bore fruit. Next comes Al-Birni, of which was said, \"It\\ncauseth sickness to depart, and there is no sickness in it.\" The Wahshi\\non one occasion bent its head, and \"salamed\" to Mohammed as he ate its\\nfruit, for which reason even now its lofty tuft turns earthwards. The\\nSayhani (Crier) is so called, because when the founder of Al-Islam,\\nholding Ali\\'s hand, happened to pass beneath, it cried, \"This is\\nMohammed the Prince of Prophets, and this is Ali the Prince of the\\nPious, and the Progenitor of the Immaculate Imams.[FN#6]\" Of course the\\ndescendants of so intelligent a vegetable hold high rank in the kingdom\\nof palms, and the vulgar were in the habit of eating the Sayhani and of\\nthrowing the stones about the Harim. The Khuzayriyah is thus named\\nbecause it preserves its green colour, even when ripe; it is dried and\\npreserved as a curiosity. The Jabali is the common fruit: the poorest\\nkinds are the Laun and\\n</p><p>[p.402]the Hilayah, costing from four to seven piastres per mudd.[FN#7]\\n</p><p>I cannot say that the dates of Al-Madinah are finer than those of\\nMeccah, although it is highly heretical to hold such tenet. The produce\\nof the former city was the favourite food of the Prophet, who\\ninvariably broke his fast with it: a circumstance which invests it with\\na certain degree of relic-sanctity. The citizens delight in speaking of\\ndates as an Irishman does of potatoes, with a manner of familiar\\nfondness: they eat them for medicine as well as for food; \"Rutab,\" or\\nwet dates, being held to be the most saving, as it is doubtless the\\nmost savoury, of remedies. The fruit is prepared in a great variety of\\nways: the favourite dish is a broil with clarified butter, extremely\\ndistasteful to the European palate. The date is also left upon the tree\\nto dry, and then called \"Balah\": this is eaten at dessert as the\\n\"Nukliyat\"-the quatre mendiants of Persia. Amongst peculiar\\npreparations must be mentioned the \"Kulladat al-Sham[FN#8]\" (necklace\\nof Sham). The unripe fruit is dipped in boiling water to preserve its\\ngamboge colour, strung upon a thick thread and hung out in the air to\\ndry. These strings are worn all over Al-Hijaz as necklaces by children,\\nwho seldom fail to munch the ornament when not in fear of slappings;\\nand they are sent as presents to distant countries.\\n</p><p>[p.403]January and February are the time for the masculation[FN#9] of\\nthe palm. The \"Nakhwali,\" as he is called, opens the female flower, and\\nhaving inserted the inverted male blossom, binds them together: this\\noperation is performed, as in Egypt, upon each cluster.[FN#10] The\\nfruit is ripe about the middle of May, and the gathering of it, forms\\nthe Arabs\\' \"vendemmia.\" The people make merry the more readily because\\ntheir favourite diet is liable to a variety of accidents: droughts\\ninjure the tree, locusts destroy the produce, and the date crop, like\\nmost productions which men are imprudent enough to adopt singly as the\\nstaff of life, is often subject to complete failure.\\n</p><p>One of the reasons for the excellence of Madinah dates is the quantity\\nof water they obtain: each garden or field has its well; and even in\\nthe hottest weather the Persian wheel floods the soil every third day.\\nIt has been observed that the date-tree can live in dry and barren\\nspots; but it loves the beds of streams and places where moisture is\\nprocurable. The palms scattered over the other parts of the plain, and\\ndepending solely upon rain water, produce less fruit, and that too of\\nan inferior quality.\\n</p><p><br />\\nVerdure is not usually wholesome in Arabia, yet invalids leave the\\nclose atmosphere of Al-Madinah to seek health under the cool shades of\\nKuba. The gardens are divided by what might almost be called lanes,\\nlong narrow lines with tall reed fences on both sides. The graceful\\nbranches of the Tamarisk, pearled with manna, and cottoned over with\\ndew, and the broad leaves of the castor plant, glistening in the sun,\\nprotected us from the morning\\n</p><p>[p.404]rays. The ground on both sides of the way was sunken, the earth\\nbeing disposed in heaps at the foot of the fences, an arrangement which\\nfacilitates irrigation, by giving a fall to the water, and in some\\ncases affords a richer soil than the surface. This part of the Madinah\\nplain, however, being higher than the rest, is less subject to the\\ndisease of salt and nitre. On the way here and there the earth crumbles\\nand looks dark under the dew of morning; but nowhere has it broken out\\ninto that glittering efflorescence which denotes the last stage of the\\nattack. The fields and gardens are divided into small oblongs,\\nseparated from one another by little ridges of mould which form\\ndiminutive water-courses. Of the cereals there are luxuriant maize,\\nwheat, and barley, but the latter two are in small quantities. Here and\\nthere patches of \"Barsim,\" or Egyptian clover, glitter brightly in the\\nsunbeams. The principal vegetables are Badanjan (Egg-plant), the\\nBamiyah (a kind of esculent hibiscus, called Bhendi in India), and\\nMulukhiyah (Corchoris olitorius), a mucilaginous spinage common\\nthroughout this part of the East. These three are eaten by citizens of\\nevery rank; they are, in fact, the potatoes and the greens of Arabia. I\\nremarked also onions and leeks in fair quantities, a few beds of\\ncarrots and beans; some Fijl (radishes), Lift (turnips), gourds,\\ncucumbers, and similar plants. Fruit trees abound. There are five\\ndescriptions of vines, the best of which is Al-Sharifi, a long white\\ngrape of a flavour somewhat resembling the produce of Tuscany.[FN#11]\\nNext to it, and very similar, is Al-Birni. The Hijazi is a round fruit,\\nsweet, but insipid, which is also the reproach of the Sawadi, or black\\ngrape. And lastly, the Raziki is a small white fruit, with a diminutive\\nstone. The Nebek, Lote,\\n</p><p>[p.405]or Jujube, is here a fine large tree with a dark green leaf,\\nroundish and polished like the olive; it is armed with a short, curved,\\nand sharp thorn,[FN#12] and bears a pale straw-coloured berry, about\\nthe size of the gooseberry, with red streaks on the side next the sun.\\nLittle can be said in favour of the fruit, which has been compared\\nsuccessively by disappointed \"Lotus eaters[FN#13]\" to a bad plum, an\\nunripe cherry, and an insipid apple. It is, however, a favourite with\\nthe people of Al-Madinah, who have reckoned many varieties of the\\nfruit: Hindi (Indian), Baladi (\"native\"), Tamri (date-like), and\\nothers. There are a few peaches, hard like the Egyptian, and almost\\ntasteless, fit only for stewing, but greedily eaten in a half-ripe\\nstate; large coarse bananas, lime trees, a few water-melons, figs, and\\napples, but neither apricots nor pears.[FN#14] There are three kinds of\\npomegranates: the best is the Shami (Syrian): it is red outside, very\\nsweet, and costs one piastre: the Turki is large, and of a white\\ncolour: and the Misri has a greenish rind, and a somewhat sub-acid and\\nharsh flavour; the latter are sold at one-fourth the price of the best.\\nI never saw in the East, except at Meccah, finer fruits than the Shami:\\nalmost stoneless like those of Maskat, they are delicately perfumed,\\nand as large as an infant\\'s head. Al-Madinah is celebrated, like Taif,\\nfor its \"Rubb Rumman,\" a thick pomegranate syrup, drunk\\n</p><p>[p.406]with water during the hot weather, and esteemed cooling and\\nwholesome.\\n</p><p>After threading our way through the gardens, an operation requiring\\nless time than to describe them, we saw, peeping through the groves,\\nKuba\\'s simple minaret. Then we came in sight of a confused heap of huts\\nand dwelling-houses, chapels and towers with trees between, and foul\\nlanes, heaps of rubbish, and barking dogs,-the usual material of a\\nHijazi village. Having dismounted, we gave our animals in charge of a\\ndozen infant Badawin, the produce of the peasant gardeners, who shouted\\n\"Bakhshish\" the moment they saw us. To this they were urged by their\\nmothers, and I willingly parted with a few paras for the purpose of\\nestablishing an intercourse with fellow-creatures so fearfully and\\nwonderfully resembling the tailless baboon. Their bodies, unlike those\\nof Egyptian children, were slim[FN#15] and straight, but their ribs\\nstood out with curious distinctness; the colour of the skin was that\\noily lamp-black seen upon the face of a European sweep; and the\\nelf-locks, thatching the cocoa-nut heads, had been stained by the sun,\\nwind, and rain to that reddish-brown hue which Hindu romances have\\nappropriated to their Rakshasas or demons. Each anatomy carried in his\\narms a stark-naked miniature of himself, fierce-looking babies with\\nfaces all eyes, and the strong little wretches were still able to\\nextend the right hand and exert their lungs with direful clamour. Their\\nmothers were fit progenitors for such progeny: long, gaunt, with\\nemaciated limbs, wall-sided, high-shouldered, and straight-backed, with\\npendulous bosoms, spider-like arms, and splay feet. Their long\\nelf-locks, wrinkled faces, and high cheek-bones, their lips darker than\\nthe epidermis, hollow staring eyes, sparkling as if to light up the\\nextreme\\n</p><p>[p.407]ugliness around, and voices screaming as though in a perennial\\nrage, invested them with all the \"charms of Sycorax.\" These \"Houris of\\nJahannam\" were habited in long night-gowns dyed blue to conceal want of\\nwashing, and the squalid children had about a yard of the same material\\nwrapped round their waists for all toilette. This is not an overdrawn\\nportrait of the farmer race of Arabs, the most despised by their\\nfellow-countrymen, and the most hard-favoured, morally as well as\\nphysically, of all the breed.\\n</p><p>Before entering the Mosque of Al-Kuba[FN#16] it will be necessary to\\ncall to mind some passages of its past history. When the Apostle\\'s\\nshe-camel, Al-Kaswa, as he was approaching Al-Madinah after the flight\\nfrom Meccah, knelt down here, he desired his companions to mount the\\nanimal. Abu Bakr and Omar[FN#17] did so; still she sat upon the ground;\\nbut when Ali obeyed the order, she arose. The Apostle bade him loose\\nher halter, for she was directed by Allah, and the Mosque walls were\\nbuilt upon the line over which she trod. It was the first place of\\npublic prayer in Al-Islam. Mohammed laid the first brick, and with an\\n\"Anzah,\" or iron-shod javelin, marked out the direction of\\nprayer[FN#18]: each of his successors followed his example. According\\nto most historians, the\\n</p><p>[p.408]land belonged to Abu Ayyub the Ansari, the Apostle\\'s host; for\\nwhich reason the \"Bayt Ayyub,\" his descendants, still perform the\\nservice of the Mosque, keep the key, and share with the Bawwabs, or\\nporters, the alms and fees here offered by the Faithful. Others\\ndeclared that the ground was the property of one Linah, a woman who was\\nin the habit of tethering her ass there.[FN#19] The Apostle used to\\nvisit it every Saturday[FN#20] on foot, and always made a point of\\npraying the dawn-prayer there on the 17th Ramazan.[FN#21] A number of\\ntraditions testify to its dignity: of these, two are especially\\nsignificant. The first assures all Moslems that a prayer at Kuba is\\nequal to a Lesser Pilgrimage at Meccah in religious efficacy; and the\\nsecond declares that such devotion is more acceptable to the Deity than\\nprostrations at the Bayt al-Mukuddas (Jerusalem). Moreover, sundry\\nmiracles took place here, and a verset of the Koran descended from\\nheaven. For which reasons the Mosque was much respected by Omar, who,\\nonce finding it empty, swept it himself with a broom of thorns, and\\nexpressed his wonder at the lukewarmness of Moslem piety. It was\\noriginally a square building of very small size; Osman enlarged it in\\nthe direction of the minaret, making it sixty-six cubits each way. It\\nis no longer \"mean and decayed\" as in Burckhardt\\'s time: the Sultan Abd\\nal-Hamid, father of\\n</p><p>[p.409]the Sultan Mahmud, erected a minaret of Turkish shape and a neat\\nstructure of cut stone, whose crenelles make it look more like a place\\nof defence than of prayer. It has, however, no preten[s]ions to\\ngrandeur. To the South a small and narrow Riwak (porch), with\\nunpretending columns, looks out Northwards upon a little open area\\nsimply sanded over; and this is the whole building.\\n</p><p>The large Mastabah or stone bench at the entrance of the Mosque was\\ncrowded with sitting people: we therefore lost no time, after ablution\\nand the Niyat (\"the Intention\") peculiar to this Visitation, in\\nascending the steps, in pulling off our slippers, and in entering the\\nsacred building. We stood upon the Musalla al-Nabi (the Prophet\\'s place\\nof Prayer)[FN22]: after Shaykh Nur and Hamid had forcibly cleared that\\nauspicious spot of a devout Indian, and had spread a rug upon the dirty\\nmatting, we performed a two-bow prayer, in font of a pillar into which\\na diminutive marble Mihrab or niche had been inserted by way of\\nmemento. Then came the Dua, or supplication, which was as follows:\\n</p><p>\"O Allah! bless and preserve, and increase, and perpetuate, and\\nbenefit, and be propit[i]ous to, our Lord Mohammed, and to his Family,\\nand to his Companions, and be Thou their Preserver! O Allah! this is\\nthe Mosque Kuba, and the Place of the Prophet\\'s Prayers. O Allah!\\npardon our Sins, and veil our Faults, and place not over us one who\\nfeareth not Thee, and who pitieth not us, and pardon us, and the true\\nBelievers, Men and Women, the Quick of them and the Dead: for verily\\nThou, O Lord, art the Hearer, the near to us, the Answerer of our\\nSupplications.\" After which we recited the Testification and the\\nFatihah, and we drew our palms as usual down our faces.\\n</p><p>We then moved away to the South-Eastern corner of the edifice, and\\nstood before a Mihrab in the Southern wall.\\n</p><p>[p.410]It is called \"Takat al-Kashf\" or \"Niche of Disclosure,\" by those\\nwho believe that as the Prophet was standing undecided about the\\ndirection of Meccah, the Archangel Gabriel removed all obstructions to\\nhis vision. There again we went through the two-bow prayer, the\\nSupplication, the Testification, and the Fatihah, under difficulties,\\nfor people mobbed us excessively. During our devotions, I vainly\\nattempted to decipher a Cufic inscription fixed in the wall above and\\non the right of the Mihrab,-my regret however, at this failure was\\ntransitory, the character not being of an ancient date. Then we left\\nthe Riwak, and despite the morning sun which shone fiercely with a\\nsickly heat, we went to the open area where stands the \"Mabrak\\nal-Nakah,\" or the \"Place of kneeling of the she-Dromedary.[FB#23]\"\\nThis, the exact spot where Al-Kaswa sat down, is covered with a\\ndiminutive dome of cut stone, supported by four stone pillars: the\\nbuilding is about eight feet high and a little less in length and in\\nbreadth. It has the appearance of being modern. On the floor, which was\\nraised by steps above the level of the ground, lay, as usual, a bit of\\ndirty matting, upon which we again went through, the ceremonies above\\ndetailed.\\n</p><p>Then issuing from the canopy into the sun, a little outside the Riwak\\nand close to the Mabrak, we prayed upon the \"Makan al-Ayat,[FN#24]\" or\\nthe \"Place of Signs.\" Here was revealed to Mohammed a passage in the\\nKoran especially alluding to the purity of the place and of the people\\nof Kuba, \"a Temple founded in Purity from its first Day;\" and again:\\n\"there live Men who love to be\\n</p><p>[p.411]cleansed, and verily Allah delights in the Clean.\" The Prophet\\nexclaimed in admiration, \"O ye Sons of Amr! what have ye done to\\ndeserve all this Praise and Beneficence?\" when the people offered him\\nan explanation of their personal cleanliness which I do not care to\\nrepeat. The temple of Kuba from that day took a fresh title-Masjid\\nal-Takwa, or the \"Mosque of Piety.\"\\n</p><p>Having finished our prayers and ceremonies at the Mosque of Piety, we\\nfought our way out through a crowd of importunate beggars, and turning\\na few paces to the left, halted near a small chapel adjoining the\\nSouth-West angle of the larger temple. We there stood at a grated\\nwindow in the Western wall, and recited a Supplication, looking the\\nwhile reverently at a dark dwarf archway under which the Lady Fatimah\\nused to sit grinding grain in a hand-mill. The Mosque in consequence\\nbears the name of Sittna Fatimah. A surly-looking Khadim, or guardian\\nstood at the door demanding a dollar in the most authoritative Arab\\ntone-we therefore did not enter.\\n</p><p>At Al-Madinah and at Meccah the traveller\\'s hand must be perpetually in\\nhis pouch: no stranger in Paris or in London is more surely or more\\nseverely taken in. Already I began to fear that my eighty pounds would\\nnot suffice for all the expenses of sight-seeing, and the apprehension\\nwas justified by the sequel. My only friend was the boy Mohammed, who\\ndisplayed a fiery economy that brought him into considerable disrepute\\nwith his countrymen. They saw with emotion that he was preaching\\nparsimony to me solely that I might have more money to spend at Meccah\\nunder his auspices. This being palpably the case, I threw all the blame\\nof penuriousness upon the young Machiavel\\'s shoulders, and resolved, as\\nhe had taken charge of my finances at Al-Madinah, so at Meccah to\\nadminister them myself.\\n</p><p><br />\\nAfter praying at the window, to the great disgust of the Khadim, who\\nopenly asserted that we were \"low\\n</p><p>[p.412]fellows,\" we passed through some lanes lined with beggars and\\nBadawi children, till we came to a third little Mosque situated due\\nSouth of the larger one. This is called the Masjid Arafat, and is\\nerected upon a mound also named Tall Arafat, because on one occasion\\nthe Prophet, being unable to visit the Holy Mountain at the pilgrimage\\nseason, stood there, saw through the intervening space, and in spirit\\nperformed the ceremony. Here also we looked into a window instead of\\nopening the door with a silver key, and the mesquin appearance of all\\nwithin prevented my regretting the necessity of economy. In India or in\\nSind every village would have a better Mosque. Our last visit was to a\\nfourth chapel, the Masjid Ali, so termed because the Apostle\\'s\\nson-in-law had a house upon this spot.[FN#25] After praying there-and\\nterribly hot the little hole was!-we repaired to the last place of\\nvisitation at Kuba-a large deep well called the Bir al-Aris, in a\\ngarden to the West of the Mosque of Piety, with a little oratory\\nadjoining it. A Persian wheel was going drowsily round, and the cool\\nwater fell into a tiny pool, whence it whirled and bubbled away in\\nchildish mimicry of a river. The music sounded sweet in my ears; I\\nstubbornly refused to do any more praying-though Shaykh Hamid, for\\nform\\'s sake, reiterated with parental emphasis, \"how very wrong it\\nwas,\"-and I sat down, as the Prophet himself did not disdain to do,\\nwith the resolution of enjoying on the brink of the well a few moments\\nof unwonted \"Kayf.\" The heat was overpowering, though it was only nine\\no\\'clock, the sound of the stream was soothing, that water-wheel was\\ncreaking a lullaby, and the limes and pomegranates, gently rustling,\\nshed voluptuous fragrance through the morning air. I fell asleep,\\nand-wondrous the contrast!-dreamed that I was once more standing\\n</p><p>\"By the wall whereon hangeth the crucified vine,\"\\n</p><p>[p.413]looking upon the valley of the Lianne, with its glaucous seas\\nand grey skies, and banks here and there white with snow.\\n</p><p>The Bir al-Aris,[FN#26] so called after a Jew of Al-Madinah, is one\\nwhich the Apostle delighted to visit. He would sit upon its brink with\\nhis bare legs hanging over the side, and his companions used to imitate\\nhis example. This practice caused a sad disaster. In the sixth year of\\nhis caliphate, Osman, according to Abulfeda and Yakut, dropped from his\\nfinger the propheti[c] ring which, engraved in three lines with\\n\"Mohammed-Apostle-(of) Allah,\" had served to seal the letters sent to\\nneighbouring kings, and had descended to the first three\\nsuccessors.[FN#27] The precious article was not recovered after three\\ndays\\' search, and the well was thenceforward called Bir al-Khatim-of\\nthe Seal Ring. It is also called the Bir al-Taflat-of\\nSaliva[FN#28]-because the Prophet honoured it by expectoration, as,\\nby-the-bye, he seems to have done to almost all the wells in\\nAl-Madinah. The effect of the operation upon the Bir al-Aris, says the\\nhistorians, was to sweeten the water, which before was salt. Their\\ntestimony, however, did not prevent my detecting a pronounced medicinal\\ntaste in the lukewarm draught drawn for me by Shaykh Hamid. In\\nMohammed\\'s days the total number of wells is recorded to\\n</p><p>[p.414] have been twenty: most of them have long since disappeared; but\\nthere still remain seven, whose waters were drunk by the Prophet, and\\nwhich, in consequence, the Zair is directed to visit.[FN#29] They are\\nknown by the classical title of Saba Abar, or the seven wells, and\\ntheir names are included in this couplet:\\n</p><p>\"Aris and Ghars, and Rumah and Buza\\'at\\nAnd Busat, with Bayruha and Ihn.\"[FN#30]\\n</p><p>[p.415]After my sleep, which was allowed to last until a pipe or two of\\nLatakia had gone round the party, we remounted our animals. Returning\\ntowards Al-Madinah, my companions pointed out to me, on the left of the\\nvillage, a garden called Al-Madshuniyah. It contains a quarry of the\\nyellow loam or bole-earth, called by the Arabs, Tafl, by the Persians,\\nGil-i-Sarshui, and by the Sindians, Metu. It is used as soap in many\\nparts of the East, and, mixed with oil, it is supposed to cool the\\nbody, and to render the skin fresh and supple. It is related that the\\nProphet cured a Badawi of the Benu Haris tribe, of fever, by washing\\nhim with a pot of Tafl dissolved in water, and hence the earth of\\nAl-Madinah derived its healing fame. As far as I could learn from the\\nMadani, this clay is no longer valued by them, either medicinally or\\ncosmetically: the only use they could mention was its being eaten by\\nthe fair sex, when in the peculiar state described by \"chlorosis.\"\\n</p><p><br />\\n[FN#1] The Baradiyah or gugglets of Al-Madinah are large and heavy, of\\na reddish-grey colour, and celebrated for cooling water, a property not\\npossessed by those of Meccan fabric.\\n[FN#2] I afterwards found reason to doubt this location. Ibn Jubayr\\n(12th century), places it an arrow-shot from the Westward wall of\\nAl-Madinah, and seems to have seen it. M.C. de Perceval states, I know\\nnot upon whose authority, that it was dug to protect the North-west,\\nthe North, and the North-eastern sides of the town: this is rendered\\nhighly improbable by the features of the ground. The learned are\\ngenerally agreed that all traces of the moat had disappeared before our\\n15th century.\\n[FN#3] In Egypt, the lower branches of the date are lopped off about\\nChristmas time to increase the flavour of the fruit; and the people\\nbelieve that without this \"Taklim,\" as it is called, the tree would\\ndie. In Upper Egypt, however, as at Al-Madinah, the fronds are left\\nuntouched.\\n[FN#4] The visitor from Al-Madinah would be badly received by the women\\nof his family, if he did not present them on his return with a few\\nboxes of dates, some strings of the same fruit, and skins full of henna\\npowder. Even the Olema allow such articles to be carried away, although\\nthey strictly forbid keepsakes of earth or stone.\\n[FN#5] This fruit must not be confounded with the enucleated conserve\\nof dates, which in Arabia, as in Egypt, is known by the name of Ajwah.\\nThe Arabs infinitely despise the stuff sold at Alexandria and Cairo,\\ndeclaring that it is fit only for cows. The Ajwah of the Oases,\\nparticularly of Siwah, is of excellent quality.\\n[FN#6] So in A.D. 1272 the Crucifix spoke to St. Thomas Aquinas.\\nSuperstitions are of no age or country.\\n[FN#7] At Al-Madinah-\\n12 Dirhams--------------(drams)------------------make 1 Wukkiyah\\n(ounce).\\n20 Wukkiyah-------------------------------------------1 Ratl (pound).\\n33 Wukkiyah and 3-------(drams)-----------------------1 Wukkah (less\\nthan 2 lbs).\\n</p>\\n<pre>4 Wukkah---------------------------------------------1 Mudd.\\n</pre>\\n<p>24 Mudd-----------------------------------------------1 Ardeb.\\nThis Ratl, or pound, is the larger one applied to particular articles\\nof commerce-such as meat, vegetables, and clarified butter; coffee,\\nrice, soap, &amp;c., are sold by the smaller Ratl of Meccah, equal to 140\\ndirhams. In Egypt, the Ratl is 144 Dirhams or 12 Wukkiyahs,-about 1 lb.\\n2 oz. and 8 dwts. troy.\\n[FN#8] \"Necklace of Syria.\" I was told they derive this name from the\\nplace where they are made. \"Al-Safra\" (on the Meccah road) being also\\ncalled Al-Sham (Damascus).\\n[FN#9] This is a translation of the Arab word \"Tazkir,\" which is\\ncertainly more appropriate than our \"caprification\" applied to dates.\\n[FN#10] The male tree is known by its sterility. In some countries only\\nthe fecundating pollen is scattered over the female flower, and this\\ndoubtless must have been Nature\\'s method of impregnating the date.\\n[FN#11] The resemblance is probably produced by the similarity of\\ntreatment. At Al-Madinah, as in Italy, the vine is \"married\" to some\\ntall tree, which, selfish as a husband, appropriates to itself the best\\nof everything,-sun, breeze, and rain.\\n[FN#12] This thorn (the Rhamnus Nabeca, or Zizyphus Spina Christi) is\\nsupposed to be that which crowned the Saviour\\'s head. There are Mimosas\\nin Syria; but no tree, save the fabled Zakhum, could produce the\\nterrible apparatus with which certain French painters of the modern\\nschool have attempted to heighten the terrors of the scene.\\n[FN#13] For what reason I am entirely unable to guess, our dictionaries\\ntranslate the word Sidr (the literary name of the tree that bears the\\nNebek) \"Lote-tree.\" No wonder that believers in \"Homeric writ\" feel\\ntheir anger aroused by so poor a realisation of the beautiful myth.\\n[FN#14] The only pears in Al-Hijaz, I believe, are to be found at Taif,\\nto which place they were transplanted from Egypt.\\n[FN#15] Travellers always remark the curious pot-bellied children on\\nthe banks of the Nile. This conformation is admired by the Egyptians,\\nwho consider it a sign of strength and a promise of fine growth.\\n[FN#16] I believe Kuba to be about three miles S.S.E. of Al-Madinah;\\nbut Al-Idrisi, Ibn Haukal, and Ibn Jubayr all agree in saying two miles.\\n[FN#17] Osman, the fourth Companion, was absent at this time, not\\nhaving returned from the first or Little Flight to Abyssinia.\\n[FN#18] Some believe that in this Mosque the direction of prayer was\\naltered from Jerusalem to Meccah, and they declare, as will presently\\nbe seen, that the Archangel Gabriel himself pointed out the new line.\\nM.C. de Perceval forgets his usual accuracy when he asserts \"le Mihrab\\nde la Mosquee de Medine, qui fut d\\'abord place au Nord, fut transfere\\nau Midi: et la Mosquee prit le nom de \\xef\\xbf\\xbdMasjid-el-Kiblatayn,\\' Mosquee\\ndes deux Kiblah. In the first place, the Mihrab is the invention of a\\nlater date, about ninety years; and, secondly, the title of Al-Kiblatyn\\nis never now given to the Mosque of Al-Madinah.\\n[FN#19] This degrading report caused certain hypocrites to build a kind\\nof rival chapel called the Mosque Zarar. It was burnt to the ground\\nshortly after its erection, and all known of it is, that it stood near\\nKuba.\\n[FN#20] Some say on Monday, probably because on that day Mohammed\\nalighted at Kuba. But the present practice of Al-Islam, handed down\\nfrom generation to generation, is to visit it on the Saturday.\\n[FN#21] There is on this day at Kuba a regular Ziyarat or visitation.\\nThe people pray in the Harim of Al-Madinah, after which they repair to\\nthe Kuba Mosque, and go through the ceremonies which in religious\\nefficacy equal an Umrah or Lesser pilgrimage. In books I have read that\\nthe 15th of Ramazan is the proper day.\\n[FN#22] This is believed to be the spot where the Prophet performed his\\nfirst Rukat, or prayer-bow.\\n[FN#23] \"Mabrak\" is the locative noun from the triliteral root\\n\"Baraka-he blessed, or he (the camel) knelt upon the ground.\" Perhaps\\nthis philological connection may have determined Mohammed to consider\\nthe kneeling of the dromedary a sign that Allah had blessed the spot.\\n[FN#24] \"Ayat\" here means a verset of the Koran. Some authors apply the\\nabove quoted lines to the Prophet\\'s Mosque at Al-Madinah exclusively,\\nothers to both buildings.\\n[FN#25] Ibn Jubayr informs us that Abu Bakr, Ayishah, and Omar had\\nhabitations at Kuba.\\n[FN#26] Some authors mention a second Bir al-Aris, belonging in part to\\nthe Caliph Osman. According to Yakut, \"Aris\" is the Hebrew or Syriac\\nword for a peasant; he quotes the plural form Arisun and Ararisah.\\n[FN#27] Others assert, with less probability, that the article in\\nquestion was lost by one Ma\\'akah, a favourite of Osman. As that\\nill-fated Caliph\\'s troubles began at the time of this accident, the\\nring is generally compared to Solomon\\'s. Our popular authors, who\\nassert that Mohammed himself lost the ring, are greatly in error.\\n[FN#28] According to some authors, Mohammed drew a bucket of water,\\ndrank part of the contents, spat into the rest, and poured it back into\\nthe well, which instantly became sweet. Ibn Jubayr applies the epithet\\nBir Al-Taflat peculiarly to the Aris well: many other authors are not\\nso exact.\\n[FN#29] The pious perform the Lesser Ablution upon the brink of the\\nseven wells, and drink of the remnant of the water in \"Tabarruk\" or to\\nsecure the blessings of God.\\n[FN#30] Some alter the 3rd, the 5th, and the 7th names to Bir al-Nabi,\\na well in the Kuba gardens, Bir al-Ghurbal, and Bir al-Fukayyir, where\\nthe Prophet, together with Salman the Persian and others of his\\ncompanions, planted date trees. The Bir al-Aris has already been\\ndescribed. The Bir al-Ghars, Gharas or Ghurs, so called, it is said,\\nfrom the place where it was sunk, about half a mile N.E. of the Kuba\\nMosque, is a large well with an abundance of water. Mohammed used to\\nperform ablution on its brink, and directed Ali to wash his corpse with\\nseven skins full of the water. The Bir Rumah is a large well with a\\nspring at the bottom, dug in the Wady al-Akik, to the north of the\\nMosque Al-Kiblatayn. It is called \"Kalib Mazni\" (the old well of\\nMazni), in this tradition; \"the best of old wells is the old well of\\nMazni.\" And ancient it must be if the legend say true, that when Abu\\nKarb besieged Al-Madinah (A.D. 495), he was relieved of sickness by\\ndrinking its produce. Some assert that it afforded the only sweet water\\nin Al-Madinah when the Prophet arrived there. The town becoming crowded\\nby an influx of visitors, this water was sold by its owner, a man of\\nthe Benu Ghaffar tribe, or according to others, by one Mazni, a Jew.\\nOsman at last bought it by paying upwards of 100 camels. The Bir\\nBuza\\'at, or Biza\\'at, or Bisa\\'at, is in the Nakhil or palm plantations,\\noutside the Bab al-Shami or North-western gate of Al-Madinah on the\\nright of the road leading to Ohod. Whoever washes in its waters three\\ntimes shall be healed. The Bir Busat is near the Bakia cemetery, on the\\nleft of the road leading to Kuba. The Prophet used to bathe in the\\nwater, and he declared it healthy to the skin. The Bir Bayruha, under\\nwhose trees the Prophet was fond of sitting, lies outside the Bab Dar\\nal-Ziyafah, leading to Mount Ohod. The Kamus gives the word \"Bayruha\\nupon the measure of Fayluha.\" Some authorities upon the subject of\\nZiyarat, write Bayruha, \"Bir Ha,\"-the well of Ha, and variously suppose\\n\"Ha\" to be the name of a man, a woman, or a place. Yahut mentions other\\npronunciations: \"Bariha,\" \"Bariha,\" \"Bayriha,\" &amp;c. The Bir Ihn is in a\\nlarge garden E. of Kuba. Little is said in books about this well, and\\nthe people of Al-Madinah do not know the name.\\n</p>\\n<h2><span id=\"Chapter_XX._THE_VISITATION_OF_HAMZAH.27S_TOMB.\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Chapter_XX._THE_VISITATION_OF_HAMZAH\\'S_TOMB.\">Chapter XX.

It is the\\nmain stream which carries off all the small currents that, at this\\nseason of general movement, flow from Central Asia towards the great\\ncentre of the Islamitic world, and in 1853 it amounted to about seven\\nthousand souls. The arrival was anxiously expected by the people for\\nseveral reasons. In the first place, it brought with it a new curtain\\nfor the Prophet\\'s Hujrah, the old one being in a tattered condition;\\nsecondly, it had charge of the annual stipends and pensions of the\\ncitizens; and thirdly, many families expected members returning under\\nits escort to their homes. The popular anxiety was greatly increased by\\nthe disordered state of the country round about; and, moreover, the\\ngreat caravan had been one day late, generally arriving on the morning\\nof the twenty-second Zu\\'l Ka\\'adah.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\\n</p><p>During the night three of Shaykh Hamid\\'s brothers, who had\\nentered as Muzawwirs with the Hajj, came suddenly to the house: they\\nleaped off their camels, and lost not a moment in going through the\\nusual scene of kissing, embracing, and weeping bitterly for joy. I\\narose in the morning, and looked out from the windows of the Majlis.\\nThe Barr al-Manakhah, from a dusty waste dotted with a few Badawi\\nhair-tents, had assumed all the various shapes and the colours of a\\nkaleidoscope. The eye was bewildered by the shifting of innumerable\\ndetails, in all parts totally different from one another, thrown\\nconfusedly together in one small field; and, however jaded with\\nsight-seeing, it dwelt with delight upon the variety, the vivacity, and\\nthe intense picturesqueness of the scene. In one night had sprung up a\\ntown of tents of every size, colour, and shape; round, square, and\\noblong; open and closed,-from the shawl-lined and gilt-topped pavilion\\nof the Pasha, with all the luxurious appurtenances of the Harim, to its\\nneighbour the little dirty green \"rowtie\" of the tobacco-seller. They\\nwere pitched in admirable order: here ranged in a long line, where a street was required; there packed in dense masses, where\\nthoroughfares were unnecessary. But how describe the utter confusion in\\nthe crowding, the bustling, and the vast variety and volume of sound?\\nHuge white Syrian dromedaries, compared with which those of Al-Hijaz\\nappeared mere pony-camels, jingling large bells, and bearing\\nShugdufs<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> (litters) like miniature green tents, swaying and tossing upon their backs; gorgeous Takht-rawan, or litters carried between camels or mules with scarlet and brass trappings; Badawin\\nbestriding naked-backed \"Daluls<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>\" (dromedaries), and clinging like\\napes to the hairy humps; Arnaut, Kurd, and Turkish Irregular Cavalry,\\nfiercer looking in their mirth than Roman peasants in their rage;\\nfainting Persian pilgrims, forcing their stubborn camels to kneel, or\\ndismounted grumbling from jaded donkeys; Kahwajis, sherbet sellers, and\\nambulant tobacconists crying their goods; country-people driving flocks\\nof sheep and goats with infinite clamour through lines of horses\\nfiercely snorting and biting and kicking and rearing; townspeople\\nseeking their friends; returned travellers exchanging affectionate\\nsalutes; devout Hajis jostling one another, running under the legs of\\ncamels, and tumbling over the tents\\' ropes in their hurry to reach the\\nHarim; cannon roaring from the citadel; shopmen, water-carriers, and\\nfruit vendors fighting over their bargains; boys with loud screams\\nbullying heretics; a well-mounted party of fine old Arab Shaykhs of the Hamidah clan, preceded by their varlets, performing the Arzah or war dance,-compared with which the Pyrenean bear\\'s performance is grace itself,-firing their duck-guns upwards, or blowing the powder into the calves of those before them,\\nbrandishing their swords, leaping frantically the while, with their bright coloured rags floating in the wind, tossing their long spears tufted with ostrich feathers high in the air, reckless where they fall; servants seeking their masters, and masters their tents, with vain cries of Ya Mohammed<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>; grandees riding mules or stalking on foot, preceded by their crowd-beaters, shouting to clear the way; here the loud shrieks of women and children, whose litters are bumping and rasping against one another; there the low moaning of some poor wretch\\nthat is seeking a shady corner to die in: add a thick dust which blurs the outlines like a London fog, with a flaming sun that draws sparkles of fire from the burnished weapons of the crowd, and the brass balls of\\ntent and litter; and-I doubt, gentle reader, that even the length, the\\njar, and the confusion of this description is adequate to its subject,\\nor that any \"word-painting\" of mine can convey a just idea of the scene.\\n</p><p>This was the day appointed for our visiting the martyrs of Ohod. After\\npraying the dawn prayers as directed at the Harim, we mounted our\\ndonkeys; and, armed with pistols and knives, we set out from the city.\\nOur party was large. Sa\\'ad the Demon had offered to accompany us, and\\nthe bustle around kept him in the best of humours; Omar Effendi was\\nalso there, quiet-looking and humble as usual, leading his ass to avoid\\nthe trouble of dismounting every second minute.<sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> I had the boy Mohammed and my \"slave,\" and Shaykh Hamid was attended by half a\\ndozen relations. To avoid the crush of the Barr al-Manakhah, we made a\\ndetour Westwards, over the bridge and down the course of the\\ntorrent-bed \"Al-Sayh.\" We then passed along the Southern wall of the\\ncastle, traversed its Eastern outwork, and issued from the Bab\\nal-Shami. During the greater part of the time we were struggling\\nthrough a living tide; and among dromedaries and chargers a donkey is\\nby no means a pleasant monture. With some difficulty, but without any\\nmore serious accident than a fall or two, we found ourselves in the\\nspace beyond and northward of the city. This also was covered with\\ntravellers and tents, amongst which on an eminence to the left of the\\nroad, rose conspicuous the bright green pavilion of the Emir Al-Hajj,\\nthe commandant of the Caravan.<sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> Hard by, half its height\\nsurrounded by a Kanat or tent wall, stood the Syrian or Sultan\\'s Mahmil\\n(litter), all glittering with green and gilding and gold, and around it\\nwere pitched the handsome habitations of the principal officers and\\ngrandees of the pilgrimage. On the right hand lay extensive palm\\nplantations, and on the left, strewed over the plain, were signs of\\nwells and tanks, built to supply the Hajj with water. We pass two small\\nbuildings, one the Kubbat Al-Sabak, or Dome of Precedence, where the\\nProphet\\'s warrior friends used to display their horsemanship; the second the Makan, or burial-place of Sayyidna Zaki al-Din,\\none of Mohammed\\'s multitudinous descendants. Then we fall into a plain,\\nresembling that of Kuba, but less fertile. While we are jogging over\\nit, a few words concerning Mount Ohod may not be misplaced. A popular\\ndistich says,\\n</p><p>\"Verily there is healing to the eye that looks\\nUnto Ohod and the two Harrahs<sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup>(ridges) near.\"\\n</p><p>And of this holy hill the Apostle declared, \"Ohod is a Mountain which\\nloves Us and which We love: it is upon the Gate of Heaven<sup id=\"cite_ref-10\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup>;\"\\nadding,\\n</p><p>\"And Ayr<sup id=\"cite_ref-11\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup> is a Place which hates Us and which We hate: it is upon the Gate of Hell.\" The former sheltered Mohammed in the time of danger; therefore, on Resurrection Day it will be raised to Paradise:\\nwhereas Jabal Ayr, its neighbour, having been so ill-judged as to\\nrefuse the Prophet water on an occasion while he thirsted, will be cast\\nincontinently into Jahannam. Moslem divines, be it observed, ascribe to\\nMohammed miraculous authority over animals, vegetables, and minerals,\\nas well as over men, angels, and jinnis. Hence the speaking wolf, the\\nweeping post, the oil-stone, and the love and hate of these two\\nmountains. It is probably one of the many remains of ancient paganism\\npulled down and afterwards used to build up the edifice of Al-Islam.\\nAccording to the old Persians, the sphere has an active soul. Some\\nsects of Hindus believe \"mother earth,\" upon whose bosom we little\\nparasites crawl, to be a living being. This was a dogma also amongst\\nthe ancient Egyptians, who denoted it by a peculiar symbol,-the globe\\nwith human legs. Hence the \"Makrokosmos\" of the plagiaristic Greeks,\\nthe animal on a large scale, whose diminutive was the\\n\"Mikrokosmos\"-man. Tota natura, repeats Malpighi, existit in minimis.\\nAmongst the Romans, Tellus or Terra was a female deity, anthropomorphised according to their syncretic system, which furnished\\nwith strange gods their Pantheon, but forgot to append the scroll\\nexplaining the inner sense of the symbol. And some modern philosophers, Kepler, Blackmore, and others, have not scrupled to own their belief in a doctrine which as long as \"Life\" is a mere word on man\\'s tongue, can neither be proved\\nnor disproved. The Mohammedans, as usual, exaggerate the dogma,-a Hadis\\nrelated by Abu Hurayrah casts on the day of judgment the sun and the moon into hell fire.\\n</p><p>Jabal Ohod owes its present reputation to a cave which sheltered the\\nApostle when pursued by his enemies<sup id=\"cite_ref-12\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-12\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup>; to certain springs of which he drank,<sup id=\"cite_ref-13\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-13\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup> and especially to its being the scene of a battle celebrated in Al-Islam. On Saturday, the 11th Shawwal, in the third\\nyear of the Hijrah (26th January, A.D. 625), Mohammed with seven hundred men engaged three thousand Infidels under the command of Abu\\nSufiyan; ran great personal danger, and lost his uncle Hamzah, the\\n\"Lord of Martyrs.\" On the topmost pinnacle, also, is the Kubbat Harun,\\nthe dome erected over Aaron\\'s remains. It is now, I was told, in a\\nruinous condition, and is placed upon the \"pinnacle of seven\\nhills<sup id=\"cite_ref-14\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-14\">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup>\" in a position somewhat like that of certain buildings on St. Angelo in the Bay of Naples. Alluding to the toil of reaching it, the Madani quote a facetious rhyme inscribed upon the wall by one of their number who had wasted his breath:-\\n</p><p>\"Malun ibn Malun<br />\\nMan tala\\'a Kubbat Harun!\"\\n</p><p>Anglice, \"The man must be a ruffian who climbs up to Aaron\\'s dome.\"\\nDevout Moslems visit Ohod every Thursday morning after the dawn\\ndevotions in the Harim; pray for the Martyrs; and, after going through the\\nceremonies, return to the Harim in time for mid-day worship. On the\\n12th of Rajab, Zairs come out in large bodies from the city, encamp on\\nthe plain for three or four days, and pass the time in feasting,\\njollity, and devotion, as is usual at pilgrimages and at saints\\'\\nfestivals in general.\\n</p><p>After half an hour\\'s ride we came to the Mustarah or resting-place, so\\ncalled because the Prophet sat here for a few minutes on his way to the\\nbattle of Ohod. It is a newly-built square enclosure of dwarf\\nwhitewashed walls, within which devotees pray. On the outside fronting\\nAl-Madinah is a seat like a chair of rough stones. Here I was placed by\\nmy Muzawwir, who recited an insignificant supplication to be repeated\\nafter him. At its end with the Fatihah and accompaniments, we remounted\\nour asses and resumed our way. Travelling onwards, we came in sight of\\nthe second Harrah or ridge. It lies to the right and left of the road,\\nand resembles lines of lava, but I had not an opportunity to examine it\\nnarrowly.<sup id=\"cite_ref-15\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-15\">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup> Then we reached the gardens of Ohod, which reflect in\\nminiature those of Kuba; and presently we arrived at what explained the\\npresence of verdure and vegetable life,-a deep Fiumara full of loose\\nsand and large stones denoting an impetuous stream. It flows along the\\nSouthern base of Ohod, said to be part of the plain of Al-Madinah, and\\nit collects the drainage of the high lands lying to the South and\\nSouth-east. The bed becomes impassable after rain, and sometimes the\\ntorrents overflow the neighbouring gardens. By the direction of this\\nFiumara I judged that it must supply the Ghabbah or \"basin\" in the\\nhills north of the plain. Good authorities, however, informed me that a large volume of water will not stand there, but flows down the beds that wind through the Ghats westward of Al-Madinah, and falls into the sea near the harbour of Wijh. To the south of the Fiumara is a village on an eminence, containing some large brick houses now in a ruinous state; these are the villas of opulent\\nand religious citizens who visited the place for change of air,\\nrecreation, and worship at Hamzah\\'s tomb. Our donkeys presently sank\\nfetlock-deep in the loose sand of the torrent-bed. Then reaching the\\nNorthern side, and ascending a gentle slope, we found ourselves upon\\nthe battle-field.\\n</p><p>This spot, so celebrated in the annals of Al-Islam, is a shelving strip\\nof land, close to the Southern base of Mount Ohod. The army of the\\nInfidels advanced from the Fiumara in crescent shape, with Abu Sufiyan,\\nthe general, and his idols in the centre. It is distant about three\\nmiles from Al-Madinah, in a Northerly direction.<sup id=\"cite_ref-16\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-16\">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup> All the visitor sees is hard gravelly ground, covered with little heaps of various coloured granite, red sandstone, and bits of porphyry, to denote the\\ndifferent places where the martyrs fell, and were buried.<sup id=\"cite_ref-17\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-17\">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup> Seen from this point, there is something appalling in the look of the Holy Mountain. Its seared and jagged flanks rise like masses of iron from\\nthe plain, and the crevice into which the Moslem host retired, when the\\ndisobedience of the archers in hastening to plunder enabled Khalid bin\\nWalid to fall upon Mohammed\\'s rear, is the only break in the grim wall.\\nReeking with heat, its surface produces not one green shrub or stunted tree; neither bird nor beast appeared upon its inhospitable sides, and the bright blue sky glaring above its bald and sullen brow, made it look only the more repulsive. I was glad to turn away my eyes from it.\\n</p><p>To the left of the road North of the Fiumara, and leading to the mountains, stands Hamzah\\'s Mosque, which, like the Harim of Al-Madinah, is a Mausoleum as well as a fane. It is a small strongly built square of hewn stone, with a dome covering the solitary hypostyle to the South, and the usual minaret. The Westward wing is a Zawiyah or oratory,<sup id=\"cite_ref-18\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-18\">&#91;18&#93;</a></sup> frequented by the celebrated Sufi and Saint, Mohammed al-Samman, the \"Clarified Butter-Seller,\" one of whose blood, the reader will remember, stood by my side in the person of Shaykh Hamid. On the Eastern side of the building a half wing projects; and a small door opens to the South, upon a Mastabah or stone bench five or six feet high: this completes the square of the edifice. On the right of the road opposite Hamzah\\'s Mosque, is a large erection, now in ruins, containing a deep hole leading to a well, with huge platforms for the\\naccommodation of travellers. Beyond, towards the mountains, are the small edifices presently to be described.\\n</p><p>Some Turkish women were sitting veiled upon the shady platform opposite\\nthe Martyrs\\' Mosque. At a little distance their husbands, and the\\nservants holding horses and asses, lay upon the ground, and a large\\ncrowd of Badawin, boys, girls, and old women, had gathered around to\\nbeg, draw water, and sell dry dates. They were awaiting the guardian, who had not yet acknowledged the summons. After half an hour\\'s vain patience, we determined to proceed with the ceremonies. Ascending by its steps the Mastabah subtending\\nhalf the Eastern wall, Shaykh Hamid placed me so as to front the tomb.\\nThere standing in the burning sun, we repeated the following prayer:\\n\"Peace be upon Thee, O our Lord Hamzah! O Paternal Uncle of Allah\\'s\\nApostle! O Paternal Uncle of Allah\\'s Prophet! Peace be upon Thee, O\\nPaternal Uncle of Mustafa! Peace be upon Thee, O Prince of the Martyrs!\\nO Prince of the Happy! Peace be upon Thee, O Lion of Allah! O Lion of\\nHis Prophet!\" After which, we asked Hamzah and his companions to lend\\nus their aid in obtaining for us and ours pardon, worldly prosperity\\nand future happiness. Scarcely had we finished, when, mounted on a\\nhigh-trotting dromedary, appeared the emissary of Mohammed Kalifah,\\ndescendant of Al-Abbas, who keeps the key of the Mosque, and who\\nreceives the fees and donations of the devout. It was to be opened for\\nthe Turkish pilgrims. I waited to see the interior. The Arab drew forth\\nfrom his pouch, with abundant solemnity, a bunch of curiously made\\nkeys, and sharply directed me to stand away from and out of sight of\\nthe door. When I obeyed, grumblingly, he began to rattle the locks, and\\nto snap the padlocks, opening them slowly, shaking them, and making as\\nmuch noise as possible. The reason of the precaution-it sounded like\\npoetry if not sense-is this. It is believed that the souls of martyrs,\\nleaving the habitations of their senseless clay,<sup id=\"cite_ref-19\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-19\">&#91;19&#93;</a></sup> are fond of sitting together in spiritual converse, and profane eye must not fall upon the scene. What grand pictures these imaginative Arabs see! Conceive the majestic figures of the saints-for the soul with Mohammedans is like the old European spirit, a something immaterial in the shape of the body-with\\nlong grey beards, earnest faces, and solemn eyes, reposing beneath the\\npalms, and discussing events now buried in the gloom of a thousand\\nyears. I would fain be hard upon this superstition, but shame prevents.\\nWhen in Nottingham, eggs may not be carried out after sunset; when\\nIreland hears Banshees, or apparitional old women, with streaming hair,\\nand dressed in blue mantles; when Scotland sees a shroud about a\\nperson, showing his approaching death; when France has her loup-garous,\\nrevenants, and poules du Vendredi Saint (i.e. hens hatched on Good\\nFriday supposed to change colour every year): as long as the Holy Coat\\ncures devotees at Treves, Madonnas wink at Rimini, San Januario melts\\nat Naples, and Addolorate and Estatiche make converts to hysteria at\\nRome: whilst the Virgin manifests herself to children on the Alps and\\nin France, whilst Germany sends forth Psychography, whilst Europe, the\\ncivilised, the enlightened, the sceptical, dotes over clairvoyance and\\ntable-turning, and whilst even hard-headed America believes in\\n\"mediums,\" in \"snail-telegraphs,\" and \"spirit-rappings,\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-20\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-20\">&#91;20&#93;</a></sup>-I must\\nhold the men of Al-Madinah to be as wise, and their superstition to be\\nas respectable, as that of others. But the realities of Hamzah\\'s Mosque\\nhave little to recommend them. The building is like that of Kuba, only\\nsmaller: and the hypostyle is hung with oil lamps and ostrich eggs, the\\nusual paltry furniture of an Arab mausoleum. On the walls are a few modern inscriptions and framed\\npoetry, written in a calligraphic hand. Beneath the Riwak lies Hamzah,\\nunder a mass of black basaltic stone,<sup id=\"cite_ref-21\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-21\">&#91;21&#93;</a></sup> resembling that of Aden,\\nonly more porous and scoriaceous, convex at the top, like a heap of\\nearth, without the Kiswah,<sup id=\"cite_ref-22\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-22\">&#91;22&#93;</a></sup> or cover of a saint\\'s tomb, and\\nrailed round with wooden bars. At his head, or westward, lies Abdullah\\nbin Jaysh, a name little known to fame, under a plain whitewashed tomb,\\nalso convex; and in the courtyard is a similar pile, erected over the\\nremains of Shammas bin Osman, another obscure Companion.<sup id=\"cite_ref-23\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-23\">&#91;23&#93;</a></sup> We then\\npassed through a door in the Northern part of the Western wall, and saw\\na diminutive palm plantation and a well. After which we left the\\nMosque, and I was under the \"fatal necessity\" of paying a dollar for\\nthe honour of entering it. But the guardian promised that the chapters\\nY.S. and Al-Ikhlas should be recited for my benefit, the latter forty\\ntimes; and if their efficacy be one-twentieth part of what men say it\\nis, the reader cannot quote against me a certain popular proverb\\nconcerning an order of men easily parted from their money.\\n</p><p>Issuing from the Mosque, we advanced a few paces towards the mountain.\\nOn our left we passed by-at a respectful distance, for the Turkish\\nHajis cried out that their women were engaged in ablution-a large\\nSahrij or tank, built of cut stone with steps, and intended to detain\\n</p><p>[p.430] the overflowing waters of the torrent. The next place we prayed\\nat was a small square, enclosed with dwarf whitewashed walls,\\ncontaining a few graves denoted by ovals of loose stones thinly spread\\nupon the ground. This is primitive Arab simplicity. The Badawin still\\nmark the places of their dead with four stones planted at the head, the\\nfeet, and the sides; in the centre the earth is either heaped up\\nMusannam (i.e. like the hump of a camel), or more generally left\\nMusattah (level). I therefore suppose that the latter was the original\\nshape of the Prophet\\'s tomb. Within the enclosure certain martyrs of\\nthe holy army were buried. After praying there, we repaired to a small\\nbuilding still nearer to the foot of the mountain. It is the usual\\ncupola springing from four square walls, not in the best preservation.\\nHere the Prophet prayed, and it is called the Kubbat al-Sanaya, \"Dome\\nof the Front Teeth,\" from the following circumstance. Five Infidels\\nwere bound by oath to slay Mohammed at the battle of Ohod: one of\\nthese, Ibn Kumayyah, threw so many stones, and with such goodwill, that\\ntwo rings of the Prophet\\'s helmet were driven into his cheek, and blood\\npoured from his brow down his mustachios, which he wiped with a cloak\\nto prevent the drops falling to the ground. Then Utbah bin Abi Wakkas\\nhurled a stone at him, which, splitting his lower lip, knocked out one\\nof his front teeth.<sup id=\"cite_ref-24\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-24\">&#91;24&#93;</a></sup> On the left of the Mihrab, inserted low down\\nin the wall, is a square stone, upon which Shaykh Hamid showed me the\\nimpression of a tooth<sup id=\"cite_ref-25\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-25\">&#91;25&#93;</a></sup>: he kissed it with peculiar reverence, and so did I. But the boy Mohammed being by me objurgated-for I remarked in him a jaunty demeanour combined with neglectfulness\\nof ceremonies-saluted it sulkily, muttering the while hints about the\\nholiness of his birthplace exempting him from the trouble of stooping.\\nAlready he had appeared at the Harim without his Jubbah, and with\\nungirt loins-in waistcoat and shirt-sleeves. Moreover, he had conducted\\nhimself indecorously by nudging Shaykh Hamid\\'s sides during divine\\nservice. Feeling that the youth\\'s \"moral man\" was, like his physical,\\nunder my charge, and determined to arrest a course of conduct which\\nmust have ended in obtaining for me, the master, the reputation of a\\n\"son of Belial,\" I insisted upon his joining us in the customary\\ntwo-bow prayers. And Sa\\'ad the Demon, taking my side of the question\\nwith his usual alacrity when a disturbance was in prospect, the youth\\nfound it necessary to yield. After this little scene, Shaykh Hamid\\npointed out a sprawling inscription blessing the Companions of the\\nProphet. The unhappy Abu Bakr\\'s name had been half effaced by some\\nfanatic Shi\\'ah, a circumstance which seemed to arouse all the evil in\\nmy companion\\'s nature; and, looking close at the wall I found a line of\\nPersian verse to this effect:\\n</p><p>\"I am weary of my life (Umr), because it bears the name of Umar.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-26\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-26\">&#91;26&#93;</a></sup>\\n</p><p>We English wanderers are beginning to be shamed out of our \"vulgar\"\\nhabit of scribbling names and nonsense in noted spots. Yet the practice\\nis both classical and oriental. The Greeks and Persians left their\\nmarks everywhere, as Egypt shows; and the paws of the Sphinx bears\\nscratches which, being interpreted, are found to be the same manner of\\ntrash as that written upon the remains of Thebes in A.D. 1879. And\\nEasterns appear never to\\n</p><p>[p.432]enter a building with a white wall without inditing upon it\\nplatitudes in verse and prose. Influenced by these considerations, I\\ndrew forth a pencil and inscribed in the Kubbat al-Sanaya,\\n</p>\\n<center><a href=\"/wiki/File:Burton_Abdullah_Name.PNG\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Burton Abdullah Name.PNG\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/Burton_Abdullah_Name.PNG\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"350\" height=\"389\" data-file-width=\"287\" data-file-height=\"319\" /></a></center><p>Issuing from the dome, we turned a few paces to the left, passed\\nnorthwards, and thus blessed the Martyrs of Ohod:\\n</p><p>\"Peace be upon Ye, O Martyrs! Peace be upon Ye, O Blessed! ye Pious! ye Pure! who fought upon Allah\\'s Path the good Fight, who worshipped your Lord until He brought you to Certainty.<sup id=\"cite_ref-27\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-27\">&#91;27&#93;</a></sup> Peace be upon You of whom Allah said (viz., in the Koran), \\xef\\xbf\\xbdVerily repute not them slain on God\\'s Path (i.e., warring with Infidels); nay, rather they are alive, and there is no Fear upon them, nor are they sorrowful!\\' Peace be upon Ye, O Martyrs of Ohod! One and All, and the Mercy of Allah and His Blessings.\"\\n</p><p><br />\\nThen again we moved a few paces forward and went through a similar\\nceremony, supposing ourselves to be in the cave that sheltered the\\nApostle. After which, returning towards the torrent-bed by the way we\\ncame, we stood a small distance from a cupola called Kubbat al-Masra.\\nIt resembles that of the \"Front-teeth,\" and notes, as its name proves,\\nthe place where the gallant Hamzah fell by the spear of Wahshi the slave.<sup id=\"cite_ref-28\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-28\">&#91;28&#93;</a></sup> We faced towards it and finished the ceremonies of this Ziyarat by a Supplication, the Testification, and the Fatihah.\\n</p><p>In the evening I went with my friends to the Harim. The minaret\\ngalleries were hung with lamps, and the inside of the temple was\\nilluminated. It was crowded with Hajis, amongst whom were many women, a circumstance which struck me from its being unusual.<sup id=\"cite_ref-29\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-29\">&#91;29&#93;</a></sup> Some pious pilgrims, who had duly paid for the privilege, were perched upon ladders trimming wax candles of vast dimensions, others were laying up for themselves rewards in Paradise, by performing the same office to the lamps; many were going through the ceremonies of Ziyarat, and not a few were sitting in different parts of the Mosque apparently overwhelmed with emotion. The boys and the beggars were inspired with fresh energy, the Aghawat were gruffer and surlier than I had ever seen them, and the young men about town walked and talked with a freer and an easier demeanour than usual. My old friends the Persians-there were about 1200 of them in the Hajj Caravan-attracted my attention. The doorkeepers stopped them with curses as they were about to enter, and all claimed from each the sum of five piastres, whilst other Moslems were allowed to enter the Mosque free. Unhappy men! they had lost all the Shiraz swagger, their mustachios dropped pitiably, their eyes would not look\\nany one in the face, and not a head bore a cap stuck upon it crookedly.\\nWhenever an \"\\'Ajami,\" whatever might be his rank, stood in the way of\\nan Arab or a Turk, he was rudely thrust aside, with abuse muttered loud\\nenough to be heard by all around. All eyes followed them as they went\\nthrough the ceremonies of Ziyarat, especially as they approached the\\ntombs of Abu Bakr and Omar,-which every man is bound to defile if he\\ncan,-and the supposed place of Fatimah\\'s burial. Here they stood in\\nparties, after praying before the Prophet\\'s window: one read from a\\nbook the pathetic tale of the Lady\\'s life, sorrows, and mourning death, whilst the others listened to him with\\nbreathless attention. Sometimes their emotion was too strong to be\\nrepressed. \"Ay Fatimah! Ay Muzlumah! Way! way!-O Fatimah! O thou\\ninjured one! Alas! alas!\" burst involuntarily from their lips, despite\\nthe danger of such exclamations; tears trickled down their hairy\\ncheeks, and their brawny bosoms heaved with sobs. A strange sight it\\nwas to see rugged fellows, mountaineers perhaps, or the fierce Iliyat\\nof the plains, sometimes weeping silently like children, sometimes\\nshrieking like hysteric girls, and utterly careless to conceal a grief\\nso coarse and grisly, at the same time so true and real, that I knew\\nnot how to behold it. Then the Satanic scowls with which they passed\\nby, or pretended to pray at, the hated Omar\\'s tomb! With what curses\\ntheir hearts are belying those mouths full of blessings! How they are\\ninternally canonising Fayruz-the Persian slave who stabbed Omar in the\\nMosque-and praying for his eternal happiness in the presence of the\\nmurdered man! Sticks and stones, however, and not unfrequently the\\nknife and the sabre, have taught them the hard lesson of disciplining\\ntheir feelings; and nothing but a furious contraction of the brow, a\\nroll of the eye, intensely vicious, and a twitching of the muscles\\nabout the region of the mouth, denote the wild storm of wrath within.\\nThey generally, too, manage to discharge some part of their passion in\\nwords. \"Hail Omar, thou hog!\" exclaims some fanatic Madani as he passes\\nby the heretic-a demand more outraging than requiring a red-hot,\\nblack-north Protestant to bless the Pope. \"O Allah! hell him!\" meekly\\nresponds the Persian, changing the benediction to a curse most\\nintelligible to, and most delicious in, his fellows\\' ears.<sup id=\"cite_ref-30\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-30\">&#91;30&#93;</a></sup>\\n</p><p>An evening hour in the steamy heat of the Harim was equal to\\nhalf a dozen afternoons; and I left it resolved never to revisit it\\ntill the Hajj departed from Al-Madinah. It was only prudent not to see\\nmuch of the \\'Ajamis; and as I did so somewhat ostentatiously, my\\ncompanions discovered that the Shaykh Abdullah, having slain many of\\nthose heretics in some war or other, was avoiding them to escape\\nretaliation. In proof of my generalistic qualities, the rolling down of\\nthe water jar upon the heads of the Maghribi Pilgrims in the \"Golden\\nThread\" was quoted, and all offered to fight for me a l\\'outrance.

I heard only of four whose genealogy is undoubted. These\\nwere,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n</p><p>1. The Bayt al-Ansari, or descendants of Abu Ayyub, a most noble race\\nwhose tree ramifies through a space of fifteen hundred years. They keep\\nthe keys of the Kuba Mosque, and are Imams in the Harim, but the family\\nis no longer wealthy or powerful.\\n</p><p>2. The Bayt Abu Jud: they supply the Harim with Imams and\\nMu\\xef\\xbf\\xbdezzins.[FN#l] I was told that there are now but two surviving members\\nof this family, a boy and a girl.\\n</p><p>3. The Bayt al-Sha\\xef\\xbf\\xbdab, a numerous race. Some of the members travel\\n</p><p>professionally, others trade, and others are employed in the Harim.\\n</p><p>4. The Bayt al-Karrani, who are mostly engaged in commerce.\\n</p><p>There is also a race called Al-Nakhawilah,[FN#2] who,\\n</p><p>[p.2]according to some, are descendants of the Ansar, whilst others\\nderive them from Yazid, the son of Mu\\xef\\xbf\\xbdawiyah: the latter opinion is\\nimprobable, as the Caliph in question was a mortal foe to Ali\\xef\\xbf\\xbds family,\\nwhich is inordinately venerated by these people. As far as I could\\nascertain, they abuse the Shaykhayn (Abu Bakr and Omar): all my\\ninformants agreed upon this point, but none could tell me why they\\nneglected to bedevil Osman, the third object of hatred to the Shi\\xef\\xbf\\xbdah\\npersuasion. They are numerous and warlike, yet they are despised by the\\ntownspeople, because they openly profess heresy, and are moreover of\\nhumble degree. They have their own priests and instructors, although\\nsubject to the orthodox Kazi; marry in their own sect, are confined to\\nlow offices, such as slaughtering animals, sweeping, and gardening, and\\nare not allowed to enter the Harim during life, or to be carried to it\\nafter death. Their corpses are taken down an outer street called the\\nDarb al-Janazah\\xef\\xbf\\xbdRoad of Biers\\xef\\xbf\\xbdto their own cemetery near Al-Bakia. They\\ndress and speak Arabic, like the townspeople; but the Arabs pretend to\\ndistinguish them by a peculiar look denoting their degradation: it is\\ndoubtless the mistake of effect for cause, about all such\\n</p><p>\\xef\\xbf\\xbdTribes of the wandering foot and weary breast.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n</p>\\n<pre>number of reports are current about the horrid\\n</pre>\\n<p>[p.3]customs of these people, and their community of women[FN#3] with\\nthe Persian pilgrims who pass through the town. It need scarcely be\\nsaid that such tales coming from the mouths of fanatic foes are not to\\nbe credited. I regret not having had an opportunity to become intimate\\nwith any of the Nakhawilah, from whom curious information might be\\nelicited. Orthodox Moslems do not like to be questioned about such\\nhateful subjects; when I attempted to learn something from one of my\\nacquaintance, Shaykh Ula al-Din, of a Kurd family, settled at\\nAl-Madinah, a man who had travelled over the East, and who spoke five\\nlanguages to perfection, he coldly replied that he had never consorted\\nwith these heretics. Sayyids and Sharifs,[FN#4] the descendants of the\\nProphet, here abound. The Benu Hosayn of Al-Madinah have their\\nhead-quarters at Suwayrkiyah:[FN#5] the former place contains six or\\nseven families; the latter, ninety-three or ninety-four. Anciently they\\nwere much more numerous, and such was their power, that for centuries\\nthey retained charge of the Prophet\\xef\\xbf\\xbds tomb. They\\n</p><p>[p.4]subsist principally upon their Amlak, property in land, for which\\nthey have title-deeds extending back to Mohammed\\xef\\xbf\\xbds day, and Aukaf,\\nreligious bequests; popular rumour accuses them of frequent murders for\\nthe sake of succession. At Al-Madinah they live chiefly at the Hosh Ibn\\nSa\\xef\\xbf\\xbdad, a settlement outside the town and south of the Darb al-Janazah.\\nThere is, however, no objection to their dwelling within the walls; and\\nthey are taken to the Harim after death, if there be no evil report\\nagainst the individual. Their burial-place is the Bakia cemetery. The\\nreason of this toleration is, that some are supposed to be Sunni, or\\northodox, and even the most heretical keep their \\xef\\xbf\\xbdRafz[FN#6]\\xef\\xbf\\xbd (heresy) a\\nprofound secret. Most learned Arabs believe that they belong, like the\\nPersians, to the sect of Ali: the truth, however, is so vaguely known,\\nthat I could find out none of the peculiarities of their faith, till I\\nmet a Shirazi friend at Bombay. The Benu Hosayn are spare dark men of\\nBadawi appearance, and they dress in the old Arab style still affected\\nby the Sharifs,\\xef\\xbf\\xbda Kufiyah (kerchief) on the head,[FN#7] and a Banish, a\\nlong and wide-sleeved garment resembling our magicians\\xef\\xbf\\xbd gown, thrown over\\nthe white cotton Kamis (shirt): in public they always carry swords,\\neven when others leave weapons at home. There are about two hundred\\nfamilies of Sayyid Alawiyah,\\xef\\xbf\\xbddescendants of Ali by any of his wives but\\nFatimah, they bear no distinctive mark in dress or appearance, and are\\neither employed at the\\n</p><p>[p.5]temple or engage at trade. Of the Khalifiyah, or descendants of\\nAbbas, there is, I am told, but one household, the Bayt Al-Khalifah,\\nwho act as Imams in the Harim, and have charge of Hamzah\\xef\\xbf\\xbds tomb. Some\\ndeclare that there are a few of the Siddikiyah, or descendants from Abu\\nBakr; others ignore them, and none could give me any information about\\nthe Benu Najjar.\\n</p><p>The rest of the population of Al-Madinah is a motley race composed of\\noffshoots from every nation in Al-Islam. The sanctity of the city\\nattracts strangers, who, purposing to stay but a short time, become\\nresidents; after finding some employment, they marry, have families,\\ndie, and are buried there with an eye to the spiritual advantages of\\nthe place. I was much importuned to stay at Al-Madinah. The only known\\nphysician was one Shaykh Abdullah Sahib, an Indian, a learned man, but\\nof so melancholic a temperament, and so ascetic in his habits, that his\\nknowledge was entirely lost to the public. \\xef\\xbf\\xbdWhy dost thou not,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd said my\\nfriends, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdhire a shop somewhere near the Prophet\\xef\\xbf\\xbds Mosque? There thou wilt\\neat bread by thy skill, and thy soul will have the blessing of being on\\nholy ground.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd Shaykh Nur also opined after a short residence at\\nAl-Madinah that it was bara jannati Shahr, a \\xef\\xbf\\xbdvery heavenly City,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd and\\nlittle would have induced him to make it his home. The present ruling\\nrace at Al-Madinah, in consequence of political vicissitudes, is the\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbdSufat,[FN#8]\\xef\\xbf\\xbd sons of Turkish fathers by Arab mothers. These half-castes\\nare now numerous, and have managed to secure the highest and most\\nlucrative offices. Besides Turks, there are families originally from\\nthe Maghrib, Takruris, Egyptians in considerable numbers, settlers from\\nAl-Yaman and other parts of Arabia, Syrians, Kurds, Afghans,\\nDaghistanis from the Caucasus, and a few Jawis\\xef\\xbf\\xbdJava Moslems. The Sindis,\\nI was told, reckon about one hundred families, who are exceedingly\\ndespised for their\\n</p><p>[p.6]cowardice and want of manliness, whilst the Baluch and the Afghan\\nare respected. The Indians are not so numerous in proportion here as at\\nMeccah; still Hindustani is by no means uncommonly heard in the\\nstreets. They preserve their peculiar costume, the women persisting in\\nshowing their faces, and in wearing tight, exceedingly tight,\\npantaloons. This, together with other reasons, secures for them the\\ncontempt of the Arabs. At Al-Madinah they are generally small\\nshopkeepers, especially druggists and sellers of Kumash (cloth), and\\nthey form a society of their own. The terrible cases of misery and\\nstarvation which so commonly occur among the improvident Indians at\\nJeddah and Meccah are here rare.\\n</p><p>The Hanafi school holds the first rank at Al-Madinah, as in most parts\\nof Al-Islam, although many of the citizens, and almost all the Badawin,\\nare Shafe\\xef\\xbf\\xbdis. The reader will have remarked with astonishment that at one\\nof the fountain-heads of the faith, there are several races of\\nschismatics, the Benu Hosayn, the Benu Ali, and the Nakhawilah. At the\\ntown of Safra there are said to be a number of the Zuyud\\nschismatics,[FN#9] who visit Al-Madinah, and have settled in force at\\nMeccah, and some declare that the Bayazi sect[FN#10] also exists.\\n</p><p>The citizens of Al-Madinah are a favoured race, although the city is\\nnot, like Meccah, the grand mart of the Moslem world or the\\nmeeting-place of nations. They pay no taxes, and reject the idea of a\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbdMiri,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd or land-cess, with extreme disdain. \\xef\\xbf\\xbdAre we, the children of the\\nProphet,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd they exclaim, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdto support or to be supported?\\xef\\xbf\\xbd The Wahhabis, not\\nunderstanding the argument, taxed them,\\n</p><p>[p.7]as was their wont, in specie and in materials, for which reason\\nthe very name of those Puritans is an abomination. As has before been\\nshown, all the numerous attendants at the Mosque are paid partly by the\\nSultan, partly by Aukaf, the rents of houses and lands bequeathed to\\nthe shrine, and scattered over every part of the Moslem world. When a\\nMadani is inclined to travel, he applies to the Mudir al-Harim, and\\nreceives from him a paper which entitles him to the receipt of a\\nconsiderable sum at Constantinople. \\xef\\xbf\\xbdThe \\xef\\xbf\\xbdIkram\\xef\\xbf\\xbd (honorarium), as it is\\ncalled, varies with the rank of the recipient, the citizens being\\ndivided into these four orders, viz.\\n</p><p>First and highest, the Sadat (Sayyids),[FN#11] and Ima[m]s, who are\\nentitled to twelve purses, or about \\xef\\xbf\\xbd60. Of these there are said to be\\nthree hundred families.\\n</p><p>The Khanahdan, who keep open house and receive poor strangers gratis.\\nTheir Ikram amounts to eight purses, and they number from a hundred to\\na hundred and fifty families.\\n</p><p>The Ahali[FN#12] (burghers) or Madani properly speaking, who have homes\\nand families, and were born in Al-Madinah. They claim six purses.\\n</p><p>The Mujawirin, strangers, as Egyptians or Indians, settled at, though\\nnot born in, Al-Madinah. Their honorarium is four purses.\\n</p><p>The Madani traveller, on arrival at Constantinople, reports his arrival\\nto his Consul, the Wakil al-Haramayn. This \\xef\\xbf\\xbdAgent of the two Holy Places\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\napplies to the Nazir al-Aukaf, or \\xef\\xbf\\xbdIntendant of Bequests\\xef\\xbf\\xbd; the latter,\\n</p><p>[p.8]after transmitting the demand to the different officers of the\\ntreasury, sends the money to the Wakil, who delivers it to the\\napplicant. This gift is sometimes squandered in pleasure, more often\\nprofitably invested either in merchandise or in articles of home-use,\\npresents of dress and jewellery for the women, handsome arms,\\nespecially pistols and Balas[FN#13] (yataghans), silk tassels, amber\\npipe-pieces, slippers, and embroidered purses. They are packed up in\\none or two large Sahharahs, and then commences the labour of returning\\nhome gratis. Besides the Ikram, most of the Madani, when upon these\\nbegging trips, are received as guests by great men at Constantinople.\\nThe citizens whose turn it is not to travel, await the Aukaf and\\nSadakat (bequests and alms),[FN#14] forwarded every year by the\\nDamascus Caravan; besides which, as has been before explained, the\\nHarim supplies even those not officially employed in it with many\\nperquisites.\\n</p><p>Without these advantages Al-Madinah would soon be abandoned to\\ncultivators and Badawin. Though commerce is here honourable, as\\neverywhere in the East, business is \\xef\\xbf\\xbdslack,[FN#15]\\xef\\xbf\\xbd because the higher\\nclasses prefer the idleness of administering their landed estates, and\\nbeing servants to the Mosque. I heard of only four respectable houses,\\nAl-Isawi, Al-Sha\\xef\\xbf\\xbdab, Abd al-Jawwad, and a family from Al-Shark (the\\nEastern Region).[FN#16] They all deal in grain, cloth, and provisions,\\nand perhaps the richest have a capital of twenty thousand dollars.\\nCaravans in\\n</p><p>[p.9]the cold weather are constantly passing between Al-Madinah and\\nEgypt, but they are rather bodies of visitors to Constantinople than\\ntraders travelling for gain. Corn is brought from Jeddah by land, and\\nimported into Yambu\\xef\\xbf\\xbd or via Al-Rais, a port on the Red Sea, one day and a\\nhalf\\xef\\xbf\\xbds journey from Safra. There is an active provision trade with the\\nneighbouring Badawin, and the Syrian Hajj supplies the citizens with\\napparel and articles of luxury\\xef\\xbf\\xbdtobacco, dried fruits, sweetmeats, knives,\\nand all that is included under the word \\xef\\xbf\\xbdnotions.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd There are few\\nstore-keepers, and their dealings are petty, because articles of every\\nkind are brought from Egypt, Syria, and Constantinople. As a general\\nrule, labour is exceedingly expensive,[FN#17] and at the Visitation\\ntime a man will demand fifteen or twenty piastres from a stranger for\\nsuch a trifling job as mending an umbrella. Handicraftsmen and\\nartisans\\xef\\xbf\\xbdcarpenters, masons, locksmiths, potters, and others\\xef\\xbf\\xbdare either\\nslaves or foreigners, mostly Egyptians.[FN#18] This proceeds partly\\nfrom the pride of the people. They are taught from their childhood that\\nthe Madani is a favoured being, to be respected however vile or\\nschismatic; and that the vengeance of Allah will fall upon any one who\\nventures to abuse, much more to strike him.[FN#19] They receive a\\nstranger at the shop window with the haughtiness of Pashas, and take\\npains to show him, by words as well as by looks, that they consider\\nthemselves as\\n</p><p>[p.10]\\xef\\xbf\\xbdgood gentlemen as the king, only not so rich.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd Added to this pride\\nare indolence, and the true Arab prejudice, which, even in the present\\nday, prevents a Badawi from marrying the daughter of an artisan. Like\\nCastilians, they consider labour humiliating to any but a slave; nor is\\nthis, as a clever French author remarks, by any means an unreasonable\\nidea, since Heaven, to punish man for disobedience, caused him to eat\\ndaily bread by the sweat of his brow. Besides, there is degradation,\\nmoral and physical, in handiwork compared with the freedom of the\\nDesert. The loom and the file do not conserve courtesy and chivalry\\nlike the sword and spear; man \\xef\\xbf\\xbdextends his tongue,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd to use an Arab phrase,\\nwhen a cuff and not a stab is to be the consequence of an injurious\\nexpression. Even the ruffian becomes polite in California, where his\\nbrother-ruffian carries his revolver, and those European nations who\\nwere most polished when every gentleman wore a rapier, have become the\\nrudest since Civilisation disarmed them.\\n</p><p>By the tariff quoted below it will be evident that Al-Madinah is not a\\ncheap place.[FN#20] Yet the citizens,\\n</p><p>[p.11]despite their being generally in debt, manage to live well. Their\\ncookery, like that of Meccah, has borrowed something from Egypt,\\nTurkey, Syria, Persia, and India: as all Orientals, they are\\nexceedingly fond of clarified butter.[FN#21]\\n</p><p>[p.12]I have seen the boy Mohammed drink off nearly a tumbler-full,\\nalthough his friends warned him that it would make him as fat as an\\nelephant. When a man cannot enjoy clarified butter in these countries,\\nit is considered a sign that his stomach is out of order, and all my\\nexcuses of a melancholic temperament were required to be in full play\\nto prevent the infliction of fried meat swimming in grease, or that\\nguest-dish,[FN#22] rice saturated with melted\\xef\\xbf\\xbdperhaps I should say\\xef\\xbf\\xbdrancid\\nbutter. The \\xef\\xbf\\xbdSamn\\xef\\xbf\\xbd of Al-Hijaz, however, is often fresh, being brought in\\nby the Badawin; it has not therefore the foul flavour derived from the\\nold and impregnated skin-bag which distinguishes the \\xef\\xbf\\xbdghi\\xef\\xbf\\xbd of India.[FN#23]\\nThe house of a Madani in good circumstances is comfortable, for the\\nbuilding is substantial, and the attendance respectable. Black\\nslave-girls here perform the complicated duties of servant-maids in\\nEngland; they are taught to sew, to cook, and to wash, besides sweeping\\nthe house and drawing water for domestic use. Hasinah (the \\xef\\xbf\\xbdCharmer,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd a\\ndecided misnomer) costs from $40 to $50; if she be a mother, her value\\nis less; but neat-handedness, propriety of demeanour, and skill in\\nfeminine accomplishments, raise her to $100=\\xef\\xbf\\xbd25. A little black boy,\\nperfect in all his points, and tolerably intelligent, costs about a\\nthousand piastres; girls are dearer, and eunuchs fetch double that sum.\\nThe older the children become, the\\n</p><p>[p.13]more their value diminishes; and no one would purchase[,] save\\nunder exceptional circumstances, an adult slave, because he is never\\nparted with but for some incurable vice. The Abyssinian, mostly Galla,\\ngirls, so much prized because their skins are always cool in the\\nhottest weather, are here rare; they seldom sell for less than \\xef\\xbf\\xbd20, and\\nthey often fetch \\xef\\xbf\\xbd60. I never heard of a Jariyah Bayza, a white slave\\ngirl, being in the market at Al-Madinah: in Circassia they fetch from\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbd100 to \\xef\\xbf\\xbd400 prime cost, and few men in Al-Hijaz could afford so expensive\\na luxury. The Bazar at Al-Madinah is poor, and as almost all the slaves\\nare brought from Meccah by the Jallabs, or drivers, after exporting the\\nbest to Egypt, the town receives only the refuse.[FN#24]\\n</p><p>The personal appearance of the Madani makes the stranger wonder how\\nthis mongrel population of settlers has acquired a peculiar and almost\\nan Arab physiognomy. They are remarkably fair, the effect of a cold\\nclimate; sometimes the cheeks are lighted up with red, and the hair is\\na dark chestnut\\xef\\xbf\\xbdat Al-Madinah I was not stared at as a white man. The\\ncheeks and different parts of the children\\xef\\xbf\\xbds bodies are sometimes marked\\nwith Mashali or Tashrih, not the three long stripes of the\\nMeccans,[FN#25] but little scars generally in threes. In some points\\nthey approach very near the true Arab type, that is to say, the Badawi\\nof ancient and noble family. The cheek-bones are high and saillant, the\\neye small, more round than long,\\n</p><p>[p.14] piercing, fiery, deep-set, and brown rather than black. The head\\nis small, the ears well-cut, the face long and oval, though not\\nunfrequently disfigured by what is popularly called the \\xef\\xbf\\xbdlantern-jaw\\xef\\xbf\\xbd; the\\nforehead high, bony, broad, and slightly retreating, and the beard and\\nmustachios scanty, consisting of two tufts upon the chin, with,\\ngenerally speaking, little or no whisker. These are the points of\\nresemblance between the city and the country Arab. The difference is\\nequally remarkable. The temperament of the Madani is not purely\\nnervous, like that of the Badawi, but admits a large admixture of the\\nbilious, and, though rarely, the lymphatic. The cheeks are fuller, the\\njaws project more than in the pure race, the lips are more fleshy, more\\nsensual and ill-fitting; the features are broader, and the limbs are\\nstouter and more bony. The beard is a little thicker, and the young\\nArabs of the towns are beginning to imitate the Turks in that\\nabomination to their ancestors\\xef\\xbf\\xbdshaving. Personal vanity, always a ruling\\npassion among Orientals, and a hopeless wish to emulate the flowing\\nbeards of the Turks and the Persians\\xef\\xbf\\xbdperhaps the only nations in the\\nworld who ought not to shave the chin\\xef\\xbf\\xbdhave overruled even the religious\\nobjections to such innovation. I was more frequently appealed to at\\nAl-Madinah than anywhere else, for some means of removing the\\nopprobrium \\xef\\xbf\\xbdKusah,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd or scant-bearded man. They blacken the beard with\\ngall-nuts, henna, and other preparations, especially the Egyptian\\nmixture, composed of sulphate of iron one part, ammoniure of iron one\\npart, and gall-nuts two parts, infused in eight parts of distilled\\nwater. It is a very bad dye. Much refinement of dress is now found at\\nAl-Madinah,\\xef\\xbf\\xbdConstantinople, the Paris of the East, supplying it with the\\nnewest fashions. Respectable men wear either a Benish or a Jubbah; the\\nlatter, as at Meccah, is generally of some light and flashy colour,\\ngamboge, yellow, tender green, or bright pink.\\n</p><p>[p.15]This is the sign of a \\xef\\xbf\\xbddressy\\xef\\xbf\\xbd man. If you have a single coat, it\\nshould be of some modest colour, as a dark violet; to appear always in\\nthe same tender green, or bright pink, would excite derision. But the\\nHijazis, poor and rich, always prefer these tulip tints. The proper\\nBadan, or long coat without sleeves, still worn in truly Arab\\ncountries, is here confined to the lowest classes. That ugliest of\\nhead-dresses, the red Tunisian cap, called \\xef\\xbf\\xbdTarbush,[FN#26]\\xef\\xbf\\xbd is much used,\\nonly the Arabs have too much regard for their eyes and faces to wear\\nit, as the Turks do, without a turband. It is with regret that one sees\\nthe most graceful head-gear imaginable, the Kufiyah and the Aakal,\\nproscribed except amongst the Sharifs and the Badawin. The women dress,\\nlike the men, handsomely. Indoors they wear, I am told, a Sudayriyah,\\nor boddice of calico and other stuffs, like the Choli of India, which\\nsupports the bosom without the evils of European stays. Over this is a\\nSaub, or white shirt, of the white stuff called Halaili or Burunjuk,\\nwith enormous sleeves, and flowing down to the feet; the Sarwal or\\npantaloons are not wide, like the Egyptians\\xef\\xbf\\xbd, but rather tight,\\napproaching to the Indian cut, without its exaggeration.[FN#27] Abroad,\\nthey throw over the head a silk or a cotton Milayah, generally\\nchequered white and blue. The Burka (face-veil), all over Al-Hijaz is\\nwhite, a decided improvement in point of cleanliness upon that of\\nEgypt. Women of all ranks die the soles of the feet and the palms of\\nthe hands black; and trace thin lines down the inside of the\\n</p><p>[p.16]fingers, by first applying a plaster of henna and then a mixture,\\ncalled \\xef\\xbf\\xbdShadar,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd of gall-nuts, alum, and lime. The hair[,] parted in the\\ncentre, is plaited into about twenty little twists called\\nJadilah.[FN#28] Of ornaments, as usual among Orientals, they have a\\nvast variety, ranging from brass and spangles to gold and precious\\nstones; and they delight in strong perfumes, musk, civet, ambergris,\\nattar of rose, oil of jasmine, aloe-wood, and extract of cinnamon. Both\\nsexes wear Constantinople slippers. The women draw on Khuff, inner\\nslippers, of bright yellow leather, serving for socks, and covering the\\nankle, with Papush of the same material, sometimes lined with velvet\\nand embroidered with a gold sprig under the hollow of the foot. In\\nmourning the men show no difference of dress, like good Moslems, to\\nwhom such display of grief is forbidden. But the women, who cannot\\ndissociate the heart and the toilette, evince their sorrow by wearing\\nwhite clothes and by doffing their ornaments. This is a modern custom:\\nthe accurate Burckhardt informs us that in his day the women of\\nAl-Madinah did not wear mourning.\\n</p><p>The Madani generally appear abroad on foot. Few animals are kept here,\\non account, I suppose, of the expense of feeding them. The Cavalry are\\nmounted on poor Egyptian nags. The horses generally ridden by rich men\\nare generally Nijdi, costing from $200 to $300. Camels are numerous,\\nbut those bred in Al-Hijaz are small, weak, and consequently little\\nprized. Dromedaries of good breed, called Ahrar[FN#29] (the noble) and\\nNamani, from the place of that name, are to be had for any sum between\\n$10 and $400; they are diminutive, but exceedingly swift, surefooted,\\nsagacious, thoroughbred, with eyes like the\\n</p><p>[p.17]antelope\\xef\\xbf\\xbds, and muzzles that would almost enter a tumbler. Mules\\nare not found at Al-Madinah, although popular prejudice does not now\\nforbid the people to mount them. Asses come from Egypt and Meccah: I am\\ntold that some good animals are to be found in the town, and that\\ncertain ignoble Badawi clans have a fine breed, but I never saw any. Of\\nbeasts intended for food, the sheep is the only common one in this part\\nof Al-Hijaz. There are three distinct breeds. The larger animal comes\\nfrom Nijd and the Anizah Badawin, who drive a flourishing trade; the\\nsmaller is a native of the country. Both are the common Arab species,\\nof a tawny colour, with a long fat tail. Occasionally one meets with\\nwhat at Aden is called the Berberah sheep, a totally different\\nbeast,\\xef\\xbf\\xbdwhite, with a black broad face, a dew-lap, and a short fat tail,\\nthat looks as if twisted up into a knot: it was doubtless introduced by\\nthe Persians. Cows are rare at Al-Madinah. Beef throughout the East is\\nconsidered an unwholesome food, and the Badawi will not drink cow\\xef\\xbf\\xbds milk,\\npreferring that of the camel, the ewe, and the goat. The flesh of the\\nlatter animal is scarcely ever eaten in the city, except by the poorest\\nclasses.\\n</p><p>The manners of the Madani are graver and somewhat more pompous than\\nthose of any Arabs with whom I ever mixed. This they appear to have\\nborrowed from their rulers, the Turks. But their austerity and\\nceremoniousness are skin-deep. In intimacy or in anger the garb of\\npoliteness is thrown off, and the screaming Arab voice, the voluble,\\ncopious, and emphatic abuse, and the mania for gesticulation, return in\\nall their deformity. They are great talkers as the following little\\ntrait shows. When a man is opposed to more than his match in disputing\\nor bargaining, instead of patiently saying to himself, S\\xef\\xbf\\xbdil crache il est\\nmort, he interrupts the adversary with a Sall\\xef\\xbf\\xbd ala Mohammed,\\xef\\xbf\\xbdBless the\\nProphet. Every good Moslem is obliged to obey such requisition by\\nresponding, Allahumma\\n</p><p>[p.18] salli alayh,\\xef\\xbf\\xbdO Allah bless him! But the Madani curtails the phrase\\nto \\xef\\xbf\\xbdA\\xef\\xbf\\xbdn,[FN#30]\\xef\\xbf\\xbd supposing it to be an equivalent, and proceeds in his\\nloquacity. Then perhaps the baffled opponent will shout out Wahhid,\\ni.e., \\xef\\xbf\\xbdAttest the unity of the Deity\\xef\\xbf\\xbd; when, instead of employing the usual\\nreligious phrases to assert that dogma, he will briefly ejaculate \\xef\\xbf\\xbdAl,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd and\\nhurry on with the course of conversation. As it may be supposed, these\\nwars of words frequently end in violent quarrels; for, to do the Madani\\njustice, they are always ready to fight. The desperate old feud between\\nthe \\xef\\xbf\\xbdJuwwa,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd and the \\xef\\xbf\\xbdBarra,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\xef\\xbf\\xbdthe town and the suburbs\\xef\\xbf\\xbdhas been put down with the\\ngreatest difficulty. The boys, indeed, still keep it up, turning out in\\nbodies and making determined onslaughts with sticks and stones.[FN#31]\\n</p><p>It is not to be believed that in a town garrisoned by Turkish troops,\\nfull of travelled traders, and which supports itself by plundering\\nHajis, the primitive virtues of the Arab could exist. The Meccans, a\\ndark people, say of the Madani, that their hearts are black as their\\nskins are white.[FN#32] This is, of course, exaggerated; but it is not\\ntoo\\n</p><p>[p.19] much to assert that pride, pugnacity, a peculiar point of honour\\nand a vindictiveness of wonderful force and patience, are the only\\ncharacteristic traits of Arab character which the citizens of\\nAl-Madinah habitually display. Here you meet with scant remains of the\\nchivalry of the Desert. A man will abuse his guest, even though he will\\nnot dine without him, and would protect him bravely against an enemy.\\nAnd words often pass lightly between individuals which suffice to cause\\na blood feud amongst Badawin. The outward appearance of decorum is\\nconspicuous amongst the Madani. There are no places where Corinthians\\ndwell, as at Meccah, Cairo, and Jeddah. Adultery, if detected, would be\\npunished by lapidation according to the rigour of the Koranic\\nlaw[FN#33]; and simple immorality by religious stripes, or, if of\\nrepeated occurrence, by expulsion from the city. But scandals seldom\\noccur, and the women, I am told, behave with great decency.[FN#34]\\nAbroad, they have the usual Moslem\\n</p><p>[p.20]pleasures of marriage, lyings-in, circumcision feasts, holy\\nisitations, and funerals. At home, they employ themselves with domestic\\nmatters, and especially in scolding \\xef\\xbf\\xbdHasinah\\xef\\xbf\\xbd and \\xef\\xbf\\xbdZa\\xef\\xbf\\xbdafaran.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd In this occupation\\nthey surpass even the notable English housekeeper of the middle orders\\nof society\\xef\\xbf\\xbdthe latter being confined to \\xef\\xbf\\xbdknagging\\xef\\xbf\\xbd at her slavey, whereas the\\nArab lady is allowed an unbounded extent of vocabulary. At Shaykh Hamid\\xef\\xbf\\xbds\\nhouse, however, I cannot accuse the women of\\n</p><p>\\xef\\xbf\\xbdSwearing into strong shudders\\nThe immortal gods who heard them.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n</p><p>They abused the black girls with unction, but without any violent\\nexpletives. At Meccah, however, the old lady in whose house I was\\nliving would, when excited by the melancholy temperament of her eldest\\nson and his irregular hours of eating, scold him in the grossest terms,\\nnot unfrequently ridiculous in the extreme. For instance, one of her\\nassertions was that he\\xef\\xbf\\xbdthe son\\xef\\xbf\\xbdwas the offspring of an immoral mother;\\nwhich assertion, one might suppose, reflected not indirectly upon\\nherself. So in Egypt I have frequently heard a father, when reproving\\nhis boy, address him by \\xef\\xbf\\xbdO dog, son of a dog!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd and \\xef\\xbf\\xbdO spawn of an Infidel\\xef\\xbf\\xbdof a\\nJew\\xef\\xbf\\xbdof a Christian!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd Amongst the men of Al-Madinah I remarked a\\nconsiderable share of hypocrisy. Their mouths were as full of religious\\nsalutations, exclamations, and hackneyed quotations from the Koran, as\\nof indecency and vile abuse\\xef\\xbf\\xbda point in which they resemble the Persians.\\nAs before\\n</p><p>[p.21] observed, they preserve their reputation as the sons of a holy\\ncity by praying only in public. At Constantinople they are by no means\\nremarkable for sobriety. Intoxicating liquors, especially Araki, are\\nmade in Al-Madinah, only by the Turks: the citizens seldom indulge in\\nthis way at home, as detection by smell is imminent among a people of\\nwater-bibbers. During the whole time of my stay I had to content myself\\nwith a single bottle of Cognac, coloured and scented to resemble\\nmedicine. The Madani are, like the Meccans, a curious mixture of\\ngenerosity and meanness, of profuseness and penuriousness. But the\\nformer quality is the result of ostentation, the latter is a\\ncharacteristic of the Semitic race, long ago made familiar to Europe by\\nthe Jew. The citizens will run deeply in debt, expecting a good season\\nof devotees to pay off their liabilities, or relying upon the next\\nbegging trip to Turkey; and such a proceeding, contrary to the custom\\nof the Moslem world, is not condemned by public opinion. Above all\\ntheir qualities, personal conceit is remarkable: they show it in their\\nstrut, in their looks, and almost in every word. \\xef\\xbf\\xbdI am such an one, the\\nson of such an one,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd is a common expletive, especially in times of\\ndanger; and this spirit is not wholly to be condemned, as it certainly\\nacts as an incentive to gallant actions. But it often excites them to\\nvie with one another in expensive entertainments and similar vanities.\\nThe expression, so offensive to English ears, Inshallah Bukra\\xef\\xbf\\xbdPlease God,\\ntomorrow\\xef\\xbf\\xbdalways said about what should be done to-day, is here common as\\nin Egypt or in India. This procrastination belongs more or less to all\\nOrientals. But Arabia especially abounds in the Tawakkal al\\xef\\xbf\\xbd Allah, ya\\nShaykh!\\xef\\xbf\\xbdPlace thy reliance upon Allah, O Shaykh!\\xef\\xbf\\xbdenjoined when a man should\\ndepend upon his own exertions. Upon the whole, however, though alive to\\nthe infirmities of the Madani character, I thought favourably of it,\\nfinding among this people more of the redeeming point, manliness,\\n</p><p>[p.22]than in most Eastern nations with whom I am acquainted.\\n</p><p>The Arabs, like the Egyptians, all marry. Yet, as usual, they are hard\\nand facetious upon that ill-treated subject\\xef\\xbf\\xbdmatrimony. It has exercised\\nthe brain of their wits and sages, who have not failed to indite\\nnotable things concerning it. Saith \\xef\\xbf\\xbdHarikar al-Hakim\\xef\\xbf\\xbd [(]Dominie Do-All)\\nto his nephew Nadan (Sir Witless), whom he would dissuade from taking\\nto himself a wife, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdMarriage is joy for a month and sorrow for a life,\\nand the paying of settlements and the breaking of back (i.e. under the\\nload of misery), and the listening to a woman\\'s tongue!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd And again we\\nhave in verse:\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n</p><p>\\xef\\xbf\\xbdThey said \\xef\\xbf\\xbdmarry!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd I replied, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdfar be it from me\\nTo take to my bosom a sackful of snakes.\\nI am free\\xef\\xbf\\xbdwhy then become a slave?\\nMay Allah never bless womankind!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n</p><p>And the following lines are generally quoted, as affording a kind of\\nbird\\xef\\xbf\\xbds-eye view of female existence:\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n</p><p>\\xef\\xbf\\xbdFrom 10 (years of age) unto 20,\\nA repose to the eyes of beholders.[FN#35]\\nFrom 20 unto 30,\\nStill fair and full of flesh.\\nFrom 30 unto 40,\\nA mother of many boys and girls.\\nFrom 40 unto 50,\\nAn old woman of the deceitful.\\nFrom 50 unto 60,\\nSlay her with a knife.\\nFrom 60 unto 70,\\nThe curse of Allah upon them, one and all!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n</p><p>Another popular couplet makes a most unsupported assertion:\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n</p><p>\\xef\\xbf\\xbdThey declare womankind to be heaven to man,\\nI say, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdAllah, give me Jahannam, and not this heaven.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n</p><p>Yet the fair sex has the laugh on its side, for these railers at\\nAl-Madinah as at other places, invariably marry. The\\n</p><p>[p.23]marriage ceremony is tedious and expensive. It begins with a\\nKhitbah or betrothal: the father of the young man repairs to the parent\\nor guardian of the girl, and at the end of his visit exclaims, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdThe\\nFatihah! we beg of your kindness your daughter for our son.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd Should the\\nother be favourable to the proposal, his reply is, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdWelcome and\\ncongratulation to you: but we must perform Istikharah[FN#36] (religious\\nlot casting)\\xef\\xbf\\xbd; and, when consent is given, both pledge themselves to the\\nagreement by reciting the Fatihah. Then commence negotiations about the\\nMahr or sum settled upon the bride[FN#37]; and after the smoothing of\\nthis difficulty follow feastings of friends and relatives, male and\\nfemale. The marriage itself is called Akd al-Nikah or Ziwaj. A Walimah\\nor banquet is prepared by the father of the Aris (groom), at his own\\nhouse, and the Kazi attends to perform the nuptial ceremony, the girl\\xef\\xbf\\xbds\\nconsent being obtained through her Wakil, any male relation whom she\\ncommissions to act for her. Then, with great pomp and circumstance, the\\nAris visits his Arusah (bride) at her father\\xef\\xbf\\xbds house; and finally, with a\\nZuffah or procession and sundry ceremonies at the Harim, she is brought\\nto her new home. Arab funerals are as simple as their marriages are\\ncomplicated. Neither Naddabah (myriologist or hired keener), nor indeed\\nany female, even a relation, is present at burials as in other parts of\\nthe Moslem world,[FN#38] and it is esteemed disgraceful\\n</p><p>[p.24]for a man to weep aloud. The Prophet, ho doubtless had heard of\\nthose pagan mournings, where an effeminate and unlimited display of woe\\nwas often terminated by licentious excesses, like the Christian\\xef\\xbf\\xbds\\nhalf-heathen \\xef\\xbf\\xbdwakes,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd forbad [a]ught beyond a decent demonstration of\\ngrief. And his strong good sense enabled him to see through the vanity\\nof professional mourners. At Al-Madinah the corpse is interred shortly\\nafter decease. The bier is carried though the streets at a moderate\\npace, by friends and relatives,[FN#39] these bringing up the rear.\\nEvery man who passes lends his shoulder for a minute, a mark of respect\\nto the dead, and also considered a pious and a prayerful act. Arrived\\nat the Harim, they carry the corpse in visitation to the Prophet\\xef\\xbf\\xbds\\nwindow, and pray over it at Osman\\xef\\xbf\\xbds niche. Finally, it is interred after\\nthe usual Moslem fashion in the cemetery Al-Bakia.\\n</p><p>Al-Madinah, though pillaged by the Wahhabis, still abounds in books.\\nNear the Harim are two Madrasah or colleges, the Mahmudiyah, so called\\nfrom Sultan Mahmud, and that of Bashir Agha: both have large stores of\\ntheological and other works. I also heard of extensive private\\ncollections, particularly of one belonging to the Najib al-Ashraf, or\\nchief of the Sharifs, a certain Mohammed Jamal al-Layl, whose father is\\nwell-known in India. Besides which, there is a large Wakf or bequest of\\nbooks, presented to the Mosque or entailed upon particular\\nfamilies.[FN#40] The celebrated Mohammed Ibn Abdillah al-Sannusi[FN#41]\\nhas removed\\n</p><p>[p.25] his collection, amounting, it is said, to eight thousand\\nvolumes, from Al-Madinah to his house in Jabal Kubays at Meccah. The\\nburial-place of the Prophet, therefore, no longer lies open to the\\ncharge of utter ignorance brought against it by my predecessor.[FN#42]\\nThe people now praise their Olema for learning, and boast a superiority\\nin respect of science over Meccah. Yet many students leave the place\\nfor Damascus and Cairo, where the Riwak al-Haramayn (College of the Two\\nShrines) in the Azhar Mosque University, is always crowded; and though\\nOmar Effendi boasted to me that his city was full of lore, he did not\\nappear the less anxious to attend the lectures of Egyptian professors.\\nBut none of my informants claimed for Al-Madinah any facilities of\\nstudying other than the purely religious sciences.[FN#43] Philosophy,\\nmedicine, arithmetic, mathematics, and algebra cannot be learnt here. I\\nwas careful to inquire about the occult sciences, remembering that\\nParacelsus had travelled in Arabia, and that the Count Cagliostro\\n(Giuseppe Balsamo), who claimed the Meccan Sharif as his father,\\nasserted that about A.D. 1765 he had studied alchemy at Al-Madinah. The\\nonly trace I could find was a superficial knowledge of the Magic\\nMirror. But after denying the Madani the praise of varied learning, it\\nmust be owned that their quick observation and retentive memories have\\nstored up for\\n</p><p>[p.26]them an abundance of superficial knowledge, culled from\\nconversations in the market and in the camp. I found it impossible here\\nto display those feats which in Sind, Southern Persia, Eastern Arabia,\\nand many parts of India, would be looked upon as miraculous. Most\\nprobably one of the company had witnessed the performance of some\\nItalian conjuror at Constantinople or Alexandria, and retained a lively\\nrecollection of every man\\xef\\xbf\\xbduvre. As linguists they are not equal to the\\nMeccans, who surpass all Orientals excepting only the Armenians; the\\nMadani seldom know Turkish, and more rarely still Persian and Indian.\\nThose only who have studied in Egypt chaunt the Koran well. The\\ncitizens speak and pronounce[FN#44] their language purely; they are not\\nequal to the people of the southern Hijaz, still their Arabic is\\nrefreshing after the horrors of Cairo and Maskat.\\n</p><p>The classical Arabic, be it observed, in consequence of an extended\\nempire, soon split up into various dialects, as the Latin under similar\\ncircumstances separated into the Neo-Roman patois of Italy, Sicily,\\nProvence, and Languedoc. And though Niebuhr has been deservedly\\n</p><p>[p.27]censured for comparing the Koranic language to Latin and the\\nvulgar tongue to Italian, still there is a great difference between\\nthem, almost every word having undergone some alteration in addition to\\nthe manifold changes and simplifications of grammar and syntax. The\\ntraveller will hear in every part of Arabia that some distant tribe\\npreserves the linguistic purity of its ancestors, uses final vowels\\nwith the noun, and rejects the addition of the pronoun which apocope in\\nthe verb now renders necessary.[FN#45] But I greatly doubt the\\nexistence of such a race of philologists. In Al-Hijaz, however, it is\\nconsidered graceful in an old man, especially when conversing publicly,\\nto lean towards classical Arabic. On the contrary, in a youth this\\nwould be treated as pedantic affectation, and condemned in some such\\nsatiric quotation as\\n</p><p>\\xef\\xbf\\xbdThere are two things colder than ice,<br />\\nA young old man, and an old young man.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n</p>\\n<center><a href=\"/wiki/File:Burton_Hibaz_illustration.PNG\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Burton Hibaz illustration.PNG\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/11/Burton_Hibaz_illustration.PNG\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"150\" height=\"251\" data-file-width=\"139\" data-file-height=\"233\" /></a></center><p>[FN#1] Ibn Jubayr relates that in his day a descendant of Belal, the\\noriginal Mu\\xef\\xbf\\xbdezzin of the Prophet, practised his ancestral profession at\\nAl-Madinah.\\n[FN#2] This word is said to be the plural of Nakhwali,\\xef\\xbf\\xbdone who cultivates\\nthe date tree, a gardener or farmer.

This race of sectarians,\\nabout 35,000 in number, holds to the Imamship or supreme pontificate of\\nAli and his descendants.

The former devotes himself to government and\\nwar; the latter, to learning and religion. In Persia and India, the\\nSharif is the son of a Sayyid woman and a common Moslem. The Sayyid\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbdNejib al-Taraf\\xef\\xbf\\xbd (noble on one side) is the son of a Sayyid father and a\\ncommon Moslemah.

At the battle of Ohod, we read that the combatants amused\\nthemselves with throwing stones. On our road to Meccah, the Badawi\\nattacked a party of city Arabs, and the fight was determined with these\\nharmless weapons. At Meccah, the men, as well as the boys, use them\\nwith as much skill as the Somalis at Aden. As regards these feuds\\nbetween different quarters of the Arab towns, the reader will bear in\\nmind that such things can co-exist with considerable amount of\\ncivilization. In my time, the different villages in the Sorrentine\\nplain were always at war. The Irish still fight in bodies at\\nBirkenhead. And in the days of our fathers, the gamins of London amused\\nthemselves every Sunday by pitched battles on Primrose Hill, and the\\nfields about Marylebone and St. Pancras.\\n[FN#32] Alluding especially to their revengefulness, and their habit of\\nstoring up an injury, and of forgetting old friendships or benefits,\\nwhen a trivial cause of quarrel arises.\\n[FN#33] The sentence is passed by the Kazi: in cases of murder, he\\ntries the criminal, and, after finding him guilty, sends him to the\\nPasha, who orders a Kawwas, or policeman, to strike off his head with a\\nsword. Thieves are punished by mutilation of the hand. In fact, justice\\nat Al-Madinah is administered in perfect conformity with the Shariat or\\nHoly Law.\\n[FN#34] Circumcisio utriusque sexus apud Arabos mos est vetustissimus.\\nAiunt theologi mutilationis hujus religiosae inventricem esse Saram,\\nAbrahami uxorem quae, zelotypia incitata, Hagaris amorem minuendi\\ngratia, somnientis puellae clitoridem exstirpavit.

It is a\\ncustom throughout the Moslem world, a relic, doubtless, of the Azlam or\\nKidah (seven divining-arrows) of the Pagan times. At Al-Madinah it is\\ngenerally called Khirah.\\n[FN#37] Among respectable citizens 400 dollars would be considered a\\nfair average sum; the expense of the ceremony would be about half.

Of their so misdemeaning themselves there is little danger; the\\nArab in these matters is a man from his cradle.\\n[FN#39] They are called the Asdikah; in the singular, Sadik.\\n[FN#40] From what I saw at Al-Madinah, the people are not so\\nunprejudiced on this point as the Cairenes, who think little of selling\\na book in Wakf. The subject of Wakf, however, is an extensive one, and\\ndoes not wholly exclude the legality of sale.\\n[FN#41] This Shaykh is a Maliki Moslem from Algiers, celebrated as an\\nAlim (sage), especially in the mystic study Al-Jafr. He is a Wali or\\nsaint; but opinions differ as regards his Kiramat (saint\\xef\\xbf\\xbds miracles):\\nsome disciples look upon him as the Mahdi (the forerunner of the\\nProphet), others consider him a clever impostor. His peculiar dogma is\\nthe superiority of live over dead saints, whose tombs are therefore not\\nto be visited\\xef\\xbf\\xbda new doctrine in a Maliki! Abbas Pasha loved and respected\\nhim, and, as he refused all presents, built him a new Zawiyah (oratory)\\nat Bulak; and when the Egyptian ruler\\xef\\xbf\\xbds mother was at Al-Madinah, she\\ncalled upon him three times, it is said, before he would receive her.\\nHis followers and disciples are scattered in numbers about Tripoli and,\\namongst other oases of the Fezzan, at Siwah, where they saved the Abbe\\nHamilton\\xef\\xbf\\xbds life in A.D[.] 1843.\\n[FN#42] Burckhardt\\xef\\xbf\\xbds Travels in Arabia, vol. ii. p. 174.\\n[FN#43] Of which I have given an account in chapter xvi.\\n[FN#44] The only abnormal sound amongst the consonants heard here and\\nin Al-Hijaz generally is the pronouncing of k (A[rabic]) a hard g\\xef\\xbf\\xbdfor\\ninstance, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdGur\\xef\\xbf\\xbdan\\xef\\xbf\\xbd for \\xef\\xbf\\xbdKur\\xef\\xbf\\xbdan\\xef\\xbf\\xbd (a Koran), and Haggi or Hakki (my right). This g,\\nhowever, is pronounced deep in the throat, and does not resemble the\\ncorrupt Egyptian pronunciation of the jim (j, [Arabic]), a letter which\\nthe Copts knew not, and which their modern descendants cannot\\narticulate. In Al-Hijaz, the only abnormal sounds amongst the vowels\\nare o for u, as Khokh, a peach, and [Arabic] for [Arabic], as Ohod for\\nUhud. The two short vowels fath and kasr are correctly pronounced, the\\nformer never becoming a short e, as in Egypt (El for Al and Yemen for\\nYaman), or a short i, as in Syria (\\xef\\xbf\\xbdmin\\xef\\xbf\\xbd for \\xef\\xbf\\xbdman\\xef\\xbf\\xbd who? &amp;c.)

These tribes are generally\\nat feud, and the least provocation fans their smouldering wrath into a\\nflame. The Hawamid number, it is said, between three and four thousand\\nfighting men, and the Hawazim not more than seven hundred: the latter\\nhowever, are considered a race of desperadoes who pride themselves upon\\nnever retreating,\\n</p><p>[p.29]and under their fiery Shaykhs, Abbas and Abu Ali, they are a\\nthorn in the sides of their disproportionate foe. On the present\\noccasion a Hamidah[FN#2] happened to strike the camel of a Hazimi which\\nhad trespassed; upon which the Hazimi smote the Hamidah, and called him\\na rough name. The Hamidah instantly shot the Hazimi, the tribes were\\ncalled out, and they fought with asperity for some days. During the\\nwhole of the afternoon of Tuesday, the 30th of August, the sound of\\nfiring amongst the mountains was distinctly heard in the city. Through\\nthe streets parties of Badawin, sword and matchlock in hand, or merely\\ncarrying quarterstaves on their shoulders, might be seen hurrying\\nalong, frantic at the chance of missing the fray. The townspeople\\ncursed them privily, expressing a hope that the whole race of vermin\\nmight consume itself. And the pilgrims were in no small trepidation,\\nfearing the desertion of their camel-men, and knowing what a blaze is\\nkindled in this inflammable land by an ounce of gunpowder. I afterwards\\nheard that the Badawin fought till night, and separated after losing on\\nboth sides ten men.\\n</p><p>This quarrel put an end to any lingering possibility of my prosecuting\\nmy journey to Maskat,[FN#3] as originally intended.

But\\nhe offered to make all inquiries about the route, and to\\n</p><p>[p.30] bring me the result at noonday, a time when the household was\\nasleep. He had almost consented at last to travel with me about the end\\nof August, in which case I should have slipped out of Hamid\\xef\\xbf\\xbds house and\\nstarted like a Badawi towards the Indian Ocean. But when the war\\ncommenced, Mujrim, who doubtless wished to stand by his brethren the\\nHawazim, began to show signs of recusancy in putting off the day of\\ndeparture to the end of September. At last, when pressed, he frankly\\ntold me that no traveller\\xef\\xbf\\xbdnay, not a Badawi\\xef\\xbf\\xbdcould leave the city in that\\ndirection, even as far as historic Khaybar,[FN#4] which information I\\nafterwards ascertained to be correct. It was impossible to start alone,\\nand when in despair I had recourse to Shaykh Hamid, he seemed to think\\nme mad for wishing to wend Northwards when all the world was hurrying\\ntowards the South. My disappointment was bitter at first, but\\nconsolation soon suggested itself. Under the most favourable\\ncircumstances, a Badawi-trip from Al-Madinah to Maskat, fifteen or\\nsixteen hundred miles, would require at least ten months; whereas,\\nunder pain of losing my commission,[FN#5] I was ordered to be at Bombay\\nbefore the end of March. Moreover, entering Arabia by Al-Hijaz, as has\\nbefore been said, I was obliged to leave behind all my instruments\\nexcept a watch and a pocket-compass, so the benefit rendered to\\ngeography by my trip would have been scanty. Still remained\\n</p><p>[p.31] to me the comfort of reflecting that possibly at Meccah some\\nopportunity of crossing the Peninsula might present itself. At any rate\\nI had the certainty of seeing the strange wild country of the Hijaz,\\nand of being present at the ceremonies of the Holy City. I must request\\nthe reader to bear with a Visitation once more: we shall conclude it\\nwith a ride to Al-Bakia.[FN#6] This venerable spot is frequented by the\\npious every day after the prayer at the Prophet\\xef\\xbf\\xbds Tomb, and especially on\\nFridays.\\n</p><p>Our party started one morning,\\xef\\xbf\\xbdon donkeys, as usual, for my foot was not\\nyet strong,\\xef\\xbf\\xbdalong the Darb al-Janazah round the Southern wall of the\\ntown. The locomotion was decidedly slow, principally in consequence of\\nthe tent-ropes which the Hajis had pinned down literally all over the\\nplain, and falls were by no means unfrequent. At last we arrived at the\\nend of the Darb, where I committed myself by mistaking the decaying\\nplace of those miserable schismatics the Nakhawilah[FN#7] for Al-Bakia,\\nthe glorious cemetery of the Saints. Hamid corrected my blunder with\\ntartness, to which I replied as tartly, that in our country\\xef\\xbf\\xbdAfghanistan\\xef\\xbf\\xbdwe\\nburned the body of every heretic upon whom we could lay our hands. This\\ntruly Islamitic custom was heard with general applause, and as the\\nlittle dispute ended, we stood at the open gate of Al-Bakia. Then\\nhaving dismounted I sat down on a low Dakkah or stone bench within the\\nwalls, to obtain a general view and to prepare for the most fatiguing\\nof the Visitations.\\n</p><p>There is a tradition that seventy thousand, or according to others a\\nhundred thousand saints, all with faces like full moons, shall cleave\\non the last day the yawning bosom\\n</p><p>[p.32] of Al-Bakia.[FN#8] About ten thousand of the Ashab (Companions\\nof the Prophet) and innumerable Sadat are here buried: their graves are\\nforgotten, because, in the olden time, tombstones were not placed over\\nthe last resting-places of mankind. The first of flesh who shall arise\\nis Mohammed, the second Abu Bakr, the third Omar, then the people of\\nAl-Bakia (amongst whom is Osman, the fourth Caliph), and then the\\nincol[ae] of the Jannat al-Ma\\xef\\xbf\\xbdala, the Meccan cemetery. The Hadis, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdwhoever\\ndies at the two Harims shall rise with the Sure on the Day of judgment,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\nhas made these spots priceless in value. And even upon earth they might\\nbe made a mine of wealth. Like the catacombs at Rome, Al-Bakia is\\nliterally full of the odour of sanctity, and a single item of the great\\naggregate here would render any other Moslem town famous. It is a pity\\nthat this people refuses to exhume its relics.\\n</p><p>The first person buried in Al-Bakia was Osman bin Maz\\xef\\xbf\\xbdun, the first of\\nthe Muhajirs, who died at Al-Madinah. In the month of Sha\\xef\\xbf\\xbdaban, A.H. 3,\\nthe Prophet kissed the forehead of the corpse and ordered it to be\\ninterred within sight of his abode.[FN#9] In those days the field was\\ncovered with the tree Gharkad; the vegetation was cut down, the ground\\nwas levelled, and Osman was placed in the centre of the new cemetery.\\nWith his own hands Mohammed planted two large upright stones at the\\nhead and the feet of his faithful follower[FN#10]; and in process of\\ntime a dome covered the spot. Ibrahim, the Prophet\\xef\\xbf\\xbds infant second\\n</p><p>[p.33] son, was laid by Osman\\xef\\xbf\\xbds side, after which Al-Bakia became a\\ncelebrated cemetery.\\n</p><p>The Burial-place of the Saints is an irregular oblong surrounded by\\nwalls which are connected with the suburb at their south-west angle.\\nThe Darb al-Janazah separates it from the enceinte of the town, and the\\neastern Desert Road beginning from the Bab al-Jumah bounds it on the\\nNorth. Around it palm plantations seem to flourish. It is small,\\nconsidering the extensive use made of it: all that die at Al-Madinah,\\nstrangers as well as natives, except only heretics and schismatics,\\nexpect to be interred in it. It must be choked with corpses, which it\\ncould never contain did not the Moslem style of burial greatly favour\\nrapid decomposition; and it has all the inconveniences of \\xef\\xbf\\xbdintramural\\nsepulture.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd The gate is small and ignoble; a mere doorway in the wall.\\nInside there are no flower-plots, no tall trees, in fact none of the\\nrefinements which lightens the gloom of a Christian burial-place: the\\nbuildings are simple, they might even be called mean. Almost all are\\nthe common Arab Mosque, cleanly whitewashed, and looking quite new. The\\nancient monuments were levelled to the ground by Sa\\xef\\xbf\\xbdad the Wahhabi and\\nhis puritan followers, who waged pitiless warfare against what must\\nhave appeared to them magnificent mausolea, deeming as they did a loose\\nheap of stones sufficient for a grave. In Burckhardt\\xef\\xbf\\xbds time the whole\\nplace was a \\xef\\xbf\\xbdconfused accumulation of heaps of earth, wide pits, and\\nrubbish, without a singular regular tomb-stone.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd The present erections\\nowe their existence, I was told, to the liberality of the Sultans Abd\\nal-Hamid and Mahmud.\\n</p><p>A poor pilgrim has lately started on his last journey, and his corpse,\\nunattended by friends or mourners, is carried upon the shoulders of\\nhired buriers into the cemetery. Suddenly they stay their rapid steps,\\nand throw the body upon the ground. There is a life-like pliability\\n</p><p>[p.34] about it as it falls, and the tight cerements so define the\\noutlines that the action makes me shudder. It looks almost as if the\\ndead were conscious of what is about to occur. They have forgotten\\ntheir tools; one man starts to fetch them, and three sit down to smoke.\\nAfter a time a shallow grave is hastily scooped out.[FN#11] The corpse\\nis packed in it with such unseemly haste that earth touches it in all\\ndirections,\\xef\\xbf\\xbdcruel carelessness among Moslems, who believe this to torture\\nthe sentient frame.[FN#12] One comfort suggests itself. The poor man\\nbeing a pilgrim has died \\xef\\xbf\\xbdShahid\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\xef\\xbf\\xbdin martyrdom. Ere long his spirit shall\\nleave Al-Bakia,\\n</p><p>\\xef\\xbf\\xbdAnd he on honey-dew shall feed,\\nAnd drink the milk of Paradise.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n</p><p>I entered the holy cemetery right foot forwards, as if it were a\\nMosque, and barefooted, to avoid suspicion of being a heretic. For\\nthough the citizens wear their shoes in the Bakia, they are much\\noffended at seeing the Persians follow their example. We began by the\\ngeneral benediction[FN#13]: \\xef\\xbf\\xbdPeace be upon Ye, O People of Al-Bakia!\\nPeace be upon Ye, O Admitted to the Presence of the\\n</p><p>[p.35] Most High! Receive Ye what Ye have been promised! Peace be upon\\nYe, Martyrs of Al-Bakia, One and All! We verily, if Allah please, are\\nabout to join You! O Allah, pardon us and Them, and the Mercy of God,\\nand His Blessings!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd After which we recited the Chapter Al-Ikhlas and the\\nTestification, then raised our hands, mumbled the Fatihah, passed our\\npalms down our faces, and went on.\\n</p><p>Walking down a rough narrow path, which leads from the western to the\\neastern extremity of Al-Bakia, we entered the humble mausoleum of the\\nCaliph Osman\\xef\\xbf\\xbdOsman \\xef\\xbf\\xbdAl-Mazlum,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd or the \\xef\\xbf\\xbdill-treated,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd he is called by some\\nMoslems. When he was slain,[FN#14] his friends wished to bury him by\\nthe Prophet in the Hujrah, and Ayishah made no objection to the\\nmeasure. But the people of Egypt became violent; swore that the corpse\\nshould neither be buried nor be prayed over, and only permitted it to\\nbe removed upon the threat of Habibah (one of the \\xef\\xbf\\xbdMothers of the Moslems,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\nand daughter of Abu Sufiyan) to expose her countenance. During the\\nnight that followed his death, Osman was carried out by several of his\\nfriends to Al-Bakia, from which, however, they were driven away, and\\nobliged to deposit their burden in a garden, eastward of and outside\\nthe saints\\xef\\xbf\\xbd cemetery. It was called Hisn Kaukab, and was looked upon as\\nan inauspicious place of sepulture, till Marwan included it in\\nAl-Bakia. We stood before Osman\\xef\\xbf\\xbds monument, repeating, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdPeace be upon Thee,\\nO our Lord Osman, Son of Affan![FN#15] Peace be upon\\n</p><p>[p.36] Thee, O Caliph of Allah\\xef\\xbf\\xbds Apostle! Peace be upon Thee, O Writer of\\nAllah\\xef\\xbf\\xbds Book! Peace be upon Thee, in whose Presence the Angels are\\nashamed![FN#16] Peace be upon Thee, O Collector of the Koran! Peace be\\nupon Thee, O Son-in-Law of the Prophet! Peace be upon Thee, O Lord of\\nthe Two Lights (the two daughters of Mohammed)![FN#17] Peace be upon\\nThee, who fought the Battle of the Faith! Allah be satisfied with Thee,\\nand cause Thee to be satisfied, and render Heaven thy Habitation! Peace\\nbe upon Thee, and the Mercy of Allah and His Blessing, and Praise be to\\nAllah, Lord of the (three) Worlds!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd This supplication concluded in the\\nusual manner. After which we gave alms, and settled with ten piastres\\nthe demands of the Khadim[FN#18] who takes charge of the tomb: this\\ndouble-disbursing process had to be repeated at each station.\\n</p><p>Then moving a few paces to the North, we faced Eastwards, and performed\\nthe Visitation of Abu Sa\\xef\\xbf\\xbdid al-Khazari, a Sahib or Companion of the\\nProphet, whose sepulchre lies outside Al-Bakia. The third place visited\\nwas a dome containing the tomb of our lady Halimah, the Badawi\\nwet-nurse who took charge of Mohammed[FN#19]:\\n</p><p>[p.37] she is addressed hus; \\xef\\xbf\\xbdPeace be upon Thee, O Halimah the\\nAuspicious![FN#20] Peace be upon Thee, who performed thy Trust in\\nsuckling the Best of Mankind! Peace be upon Thee, O Wet-nurse of\\nAl-Mustafa (the chosen)! Peace be upon Thee, O Wet-nurse of Al-Mujtaba\\n(the (accepted)![FN#21] May Allah be satisfied with Thee, and cause\\nThee to be satisfied, and render Heaven thy House and Habitation! and\\nverily we have come visiting Thee, and by means of Thee drawing near to\\nAllah\\xef\\xbf\\xbds Prophet, and through Him to God, the Lord of the Heavens and the\\nEarths.[FN#22]\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n</p><p>After which, fronting the North, we stood before a low enclosure,\\ncontaining ovals of loose stones, disposed side by side. These are the\\nMartyrs of Al-Bakia, who received the crown of glory at the hands of\\nAl-Muslim,[FN#23] the general of the arch-heretic Yazid[FN#24] The\\nprayer here recited differs so little from that addressed to the\\nmartyrs of Ohod, that I will not transcribe it. The fifth station is\\nnear the centre of the cemetery at the tomb of Ibrahim, who died, to\\nthe eternal regret of Al-Islam, some say six months old, others in his\\nsecond year. He was the son\\n</p><p>[p.38] of Mariyah, the Coptic girl, sent as a present to Mohammed by\\nJarih, the Mukaukas or governor of Alexandria. The Prophet with his own\\nhand piled earth upon the grave, and sprinkled it with water,\\xef\\xbf\\xbda ceremony\\nthen first performed,\\xef\\xbf\\xbddisposed small stones upon it, and pronounced the\\nfinal salutation. For which reason many holy men were buried in this\\npart of the cemetery, every one being ambitious to lie in ground which\\nhas been honored by the Apostle\\xef\\xbf\\xbds hands. Then we visited Al-Nafi Maula,\\nson of Omar, generally called Imam Nafi al-Kari, or the Koran chaunter;\\nand near him the great doctor Imam Malik ibn Anas, a native of\\nAl-Madinah, and one of the most dutiful of her sons. The eighth station\\nis at the tomb of Ukayl bin Abi Talib, brother of Ali.[FN#25] Then we\\nvisited the spot where lie interred all the Prophet\\xef\\xbf\\xbds wives, Khadijah,\\nwho lies at Meccah, alone excepted. Mohammed married fifteen wives of\\nwhom nine survived him. After the \\xef\\xbf\\xbdMothers of the Moslems,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd we prayed at\\nthe tombs of Mohammed\\xef\\xbf\\xbds daughters, said to be ten in number.\\n</p><p>In compliment probably to the Hajj, the beggars mustered strong that\\nmorning at Al-Bakia. Along the walls and at the entrance of each\\nbuilding squatted ancient dames, all engaged in anxious contemplation\\nof every approaching face, and in pointing to dirty cotton napkins\\nspread upon the ground before them, and studded with a few coins, gold,\\nsilver, or copper, according to the expectations of the proprietress.\\nThey raised their voices to demand largesse: some promised to recite\\nFatihahs, and the most audacious seized visitors by the skirts of their\\n</p><p>[p.39] garments. Fakihs, ready to write \\xef\\xbf\\xbdY.S.,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd or anything else demanded\\nof them, covered the little heaps and eminences of the cemetery, all\\nbegging lustily, and looking as though they would murder you, when told\\nhow beneficent is Allah\\xef\\xbf\\xbdpolite form of declining to be charitable. At the\\ndoors of the tombs old housewives, and some young ones also, struggled\\nwith you for your slippers as you doffed them, and not unfrequently the\\ncharge of the pair was divided between two. Inside, when the boys were\\nnot loud enough or importunate enough for presents, they were urged on\\nby the adults and seniors, the relatives of the \\xef\\xbf\\xbdKhadims\\xef\\xbf\\xbd and hangers-on.\\nUnfortunately for me, Shaykh Hamid was renowned for taking charge of\\nwealthy pilgrims: the result was, that my purse was lightened of three\\ndollars. I must add that although at least fifty female voices loudly\\npromised that morning, for the sum of ten parahs each, to supplicate\\nAllah in behalf of my lame foot, no perceptible good came of their\\nefforts.\\n</p><p>Before leaving Al-Bakia, we went to the eleventh station, [FN#26] the\\nKubbat al-Abbasiyah, or Dome of Abbas. Originally built by the Abbaside\\nCaliphs in A.H. 519, it is a larger and a handsomer building than its\\nfellows, and it is situated on the right-hand side of the gate as you\\nenter. The crowd of beggars at the door testified to its importance:\\nthey were attracted by the Persians who assemble here in force to weep\\nand to pray. Crossing the threshold with some difficulty, I walked\\nround a mass of tombs which occupies the centre of the building,\\nleaving but a narrow passage between it and the walls. It is railed\\nround, and covered over with several \\xef\\xbf\\xbdKiswahs\\xef\\xbf\\xbd of green cloth worked with\\nwhite letters: it looked like a confused\\n</p><p>[p.40] heap, but it might have appeared irregular to me by the reason\\nof the mob around. The Eastern portion contains the body of Al-Hasan,\\nthe son of Ali and grandson of the Prophet[FN#27]; the Imam Zayn\\nal-Abidin, son of Al-Hosayn, and great-grandson to the Prophet; the\\nImam Mohammed al-Bakir (fifth Imam), son to Zayn al-Abidin; and his son\\nthe Imam a\\xef\\xbf\\xbdafar al-Sadik\\xef\\xbf\\xbdall four descendants of the Prophet, and buried in\\nthe same grave with Abbas ibn Abd al-Muttalib, uncle to Mohammed. It is\\nalmost needless to say that these names are subjects of great\\ncontroversy. Al-Musudi mentions that here was found an inscribed stone\\ndeclaring it to be the tomb of the Lady Fatimah, of Hasan her brother,\\nof Ali bin Hosayn, of Mohammed bin Ali, and of Ja\\xef\\xbf\\xbdafar bin Mohammed. Ibn\\nJubayr, describing Al-Bakia, mentions only two in this tomb, Abbas and\\nHasan; the head of the latter, he says, in the direction of the former\\xef\\xbf\\xbds\\nfeet. Other authors\\n</p><p>[p.41] relate that in it, about the ninth century of the Hijrah, was\\nfound a wooden box covered with fresh-looking red felt cloth, with\\nbright brass nails, and they believe it to have contained the corpse of\\nAli, placed here by his own son Hasan.\\n</p><p>Standing opposite this mysterious tomb, we repeated, with difficulty by\\nreason of the Persians weeping, the following supplication:\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\xef\\xbf\\xbdPeace be upon\\nYe, O Family of the Prophet! O Lord Abbas, the free from Impurity and\\nUncleanness, and Father\\xef\\xbf\\xbds Brother to the Best of Men! And Thou too O Lord\\nHasan, Grandson of the Prophet! And thou also O Lord Zayn\\nal-Abidin[FN#28]! Peace be upon Ye, One and All, for verily God hath\\nbeen pleased to deliver You from all Guile, and to purify You with all\\nPurity. The Mercy of Allah and His Blessings be upon Ye, and verily He\\nis the Praised, the Mighty!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd After which, freeing ourselves from the\\nhands of greedy boys, we turned round and faced the southern wall,\\nclose to which is a tomb attributed to the Lady Fatimah.[FN#29] I will\\nnot repeat the prayer, it being the same as that recited in the Harim.\\n</p><p>[p.42] Issuing from the hot and crowded dome, we recovered our slippers\\nafter much trouble, and found that our garments had suffered from the\\nfrantic gesticulations of the Persians. We then walked to the gate of\\nAl-Bakia, stood facing the cemetery upon an elevated piece of ground,\\nand delivered the general benediction.\\n</p><p>\\xef\\xbf\\xbdO Allah! O Allah! O Allah! O full of Mercy! O abounding in Beneficence!\\nLord of Length (of days), and Prosperity, and Goodness! O Thou, who\\nwhen asked, grantest, and when prayed for aid, aidest! Have Mercy upon\\nthe Companions of thy Prophet, of the Muhajirin, and the Ansar! Have\\nMercy upon them, One and All!\\n</p><p>[p.43] Have Mercy upon bdullah bin Hantal\\xef\\xbf\\xbd (and so on, specifying their\\nnames), \\xef\\xbf\\xbdand make Paradise their Resting-place, their Habitation, their\\nDwelling, and their Abode! O Allah! accept our Ziyarat, and supply our\\nWants, and lighten our Griefs, and restore us to our Homes, and comfort\\nour Fears, and disappoint not our Hopes, and pardon us, for on no other\\ndo we rely; and let us depart in Thy Faith, and after the Practice of\\nThy Prophet, and be Thou satisfied with us! O Allah! forgive our past\\nOffences, and leave us not to our (evil) Natures during the Glance of\\nan Eye, or a lesser Time; and pardon us, and pity us, and let us return\\nto our Houses and Homes safe,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd (i.e., spiritually and physically)\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbdfortunate, abstaining from what is unlawful, re-established after our\\nDistresses, and belonging to the Good, thy Servants upon whom is no\\nFear, nor do they know Distress. Repentance, O Lord! Repentance, O\\nMerciful! Repentance, O Pitiful! Repentance before Death, and Pardon\\nafter Death! I beg pardon of Allah! Thanks be to Allah! Praise be to\\nAllah! Amen, O Lord of the (three) Worlds!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n</p><p>After which, issuing from Al-Bakia,[FN#30] we advanced\\n</p><p>[p.44] northwards, leaving the city gate on the left hand, till we came\\nto a small Kubbah (dome) close to the road. It is visited as containing\\nthe tomb of the Prophet\\xef\\xbf\\xbds paternal aunts, especially of Safiyah, daughter\\nof Abd al-Muttalib, sister of Hamzah, and one of the many heroines of\\nearly Al-Islam. Hurrying over our devotions here,\\xef\\xbf\\xbdfor we were tired\\nindeed,\\xef\\xbf\\xbdwe applied to a Sakka for water, and entered a little\\ncoffee-house near the gate of the town: after which we rode home.\\n</p><p>I have now described, at a wearying length I fear, the spots visited by\\nevery Zair at Al-Madinah. The guide-books mention altogether between\\nfifty and fifty-five Mosques and other holy places, most of which are\\nnow unknown even by name to the citizens. The most celebrated of these\\nare the few following, which I describe from hearsay. About three miles\\nto the North-west of the town, close to the Wady al-Akik, lies the\\nMosque called Al-Kiblatayn\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\xef\\xbf\\xbdThe Two Directions of Prayer.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd Some give this\\ntitle to the Masjid al-Takwa at Kuba.[FN#31] Others assert that the\\nProphet, after visiting and eating\\n</p><p>[p.45] at the house of an old woman named Umm Mabshar, went to pray the\\nmid-day prayer in the Mosque of the Benu Salmah. He had performed the\\nprostration with his face towards Jerusalem, when suddenly warned by\\nrevelation he turned Southwards and concluded his orisons in that\\ndirection.[FN#32] I am told it is a mean dome without inner walls,\\nouter enclosures, or minaret.\\n</p><p>The Masjid Benu Zafar (some write the word Tifr) is also called Masjid\\nal-Baghlah\\xef\\xbf\\xbdof the She-mule,\\xef\\xbf\\xbdbecause, according to Al-Matari, on the ridge\\nof stone to the south of this Mosque are the marks where the Prophet\\nleaned his arm, and where the she-mule, Duldul, sent by the Mukaukas as\\na present with Mariyah the Coptic girl and Yafur the donkey, placed its\\nhoofs. At the Mosque was shown a slab upon which the Prophet sat\\nhearing recitations from the Koran; and historians declare that by\\nfollowing his example many women have been blessed with\\noffspring.[FN#33] This Mosque is to the East of Al-Bakia.\\n</p><p>The Masjid al-Jumah\\xef\\xbf\\xbdof Friday,\\xef\\xbf\\xbdor Al-Anikah\\xef\\xbf\\xbdof the Sand-heaps,\\xef\\xbf\\xbdis in the valley\\nnear Kuba, where Mohammed prayed and preached on the first Friday after\\nhis flight from Meccah [FN#34]\\n</p><p>The Masjid al-Fazikh\\xef\\xbf\\xbdof Date-liquor\\xef\\xbf\\xbdis so called because when Abu Ayyub and\\nothers of the Ansar were sitting with cups in their hands, they heard\\nthat intoxicating\\n</p><p>[p.46] draughts were for the future forbidden, upon which they poured\\nthe liquor upon the ground. Here the Prophet prayed six days whilst he\\nwas engaged in warring down the Benu Nazir Jews. The Mosque derives its\\nother name, Al-Shams\\xef\\xbf\\xbdof the Sun\\xef\\xbf\\xbdbecause, being erected on rising ground\\nEast of and near Kuba, it receives the first rays of morning light.\\n</p><p>To the Eastward of the Masjid al-Fazikh lies the Masjid al-Kurayzah,\\nerected on a spot where the Prophet descended to attack the Jewish\\ntribe of that name. Returning from the battle of the Moat, wayworn and\\ntired with fighting, he here sat down to wash and comb his hair, when\\nsuddenly appeared to him the Archangel Gabriel in the figure of a\\nhorseman dressed in a corslet and covered with dust. \\xef\\xbf\\xbdThe Angels of Allah,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\nsaid the preternatural visitor, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdare still in Arms, O Prophet, and it is\\nAllah\\xef\\xbf\\xbds Will that Thy foot return to the Stirrup. I go before Thee to\\nprepare a Victory over the Infidels, the Sons of Kurayzah.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd The legend\\nadds that the dust raised by the angelic host was seen in the streets\\nof Al-Madinah, but that mortal eye fell not upon horseman\\xef\\xbf\\xbds form. The\\nProphet ordered his followers to sound the battle-call, gave his flag\\nto Ali,\\xef\\xbf\\xbdthe Arab token of appointing a commander-in-chief,\\xef\\xbf\\xbdand for\\ntwenty-five days invested the habitations of the enemy. This hapless\\ntribe was exterminated, sentence of death being passed upon them by Sa\\xef\\xbf\\xbdad\\nibn Ma\\xef\\xbf\\xbdaz, an Ausi whom they constituted their judge because he belonged\\nto an allied tribe. Six hundred men were beheaded in the Market-place\\nof Al-Madinah, their property was plundered, and their wives and\\nchildren were reduced to slavery.\\n</p><p>\\xef\\xbf\\xbdTantane relligio potuit suadere malorum!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n</p><p>The Masjid Mashrabat Umm Ibrahim, or Mosque of the garden of Ibrahim\\xef\\xbf\\xbds\\nmother, is a place where Mariyah the Copt had a garden, and became the\\nmother of\\n</p><p>[p.47] Ibrahim, the Prophet\\xef\\xbf\\xbds second son.[FN#35] It is a small building\\nin what is called the Awali, or highest part of the Al-Madinah plain,\\nto the North of the Masjid Benu Kurayzah, and near the Eastern Harrah\\nor ridge.[FN#36]\\n</p><p>Northwards of Al-Bakia is, or was, a small building called the Masjid\\nal-Ijabah\\xef\\xbf\\xbdof Granting,\\xef\\xbf\\xbdfrom the following circumstance. One day the Prophet\\nstopped to perform his devotions at this place, which then belonged to\\nthe Benu Mu\\xef\\xbf\\xbdawiyah of the tribe of Aus. He made a long Dua or\\nsupplication, and then turning to his Companions, exclaimed, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdI have\\nasked of Allah three favours, two hath he vouchsafed to me, but the\\nthird was refused!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd Those granted were that the Moslems might never be\\ndestroyed by famine or by deluge. The third was that they might not\\nperish by internecine strife.\\n</p><p>The Masjid al-Fath (of Victory), vulgarly called the \\xef\\xbf\\xbdFour Mosques,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd is\\nsituated in the Wady Al-Sayh,[FN#37] which comes from the direction of\\nKuba, and about half a mile to the East of \\xef\\xbf\\xbdAl-Kiblatayn.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd The largest is\\ncalled the Masjid al-Fath, or Al-Ahzab\\xef\\xbf\\xbdof the Troops,\\xef\\xbf\\xbdand is alluded to in\\nthe Koran. Here it is said the Prophet prayed for three days during the\\nBattle of the Moat, also called the affair \\xef\\xbf\\xbdAl-Ahzab,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd the last fought with\\nthe Infidel Kuraysh under Abu Sufiyan. After three days of devotion, a\\ncold and violent blast arose, with rain\\n</p><p>[p.48] and sleet, and discomfited the foe. The Prophet\\xef\\xbf\\xbds prayer having\\nhere been granted, it is supposed by ardent Moslems that no petition\\nput up at the Mosque Al-Ahzab is ever neglected by Allah. The form of\\nsupplication is differently quoted by different authors. When Al-Shafe\\xef\\xbf\\xbdi\\nwas in trouble and fear of Harun al-Rashid, by the virtue of this\\nformula he escaped all danger: I would willingly offer so valuable a\\nprophylactory to my readers, only it is of an unmanageable length. The\\ndoctors of Al-Islam also greatly differ about the spot where the\\nProphet stood on this occasion; most of them support the claims of the\\nMasjid al-Fath, the most elevated of the four, to that distinction.\\nBelow, and to the South of the highest ground, is the Masjid Salman\\nal-Farsi, the Persian, from whose brain emanated the bright idea of the\\nMoat. At the mature age of two hundred and fifty, some say three\\nhundred and fifty, after spending his life in search of a religion,\\nfrom a Magus (fire-worshipper)[FN#38] becoming successively a Jew and a\\nNazarene, he ended with being a Moslem, and a Companion of Mohammed.\\nDuring his eventful career he had been ten times sold into slavery.\\nBelow Salman\\xef\\xbf\\xbds Mosque is the Masjid Ali, and the smallest building on the\\nSouth of the hill is called Masjid Abu Bakr. All these places owe their\\nexistence to Al-Walid the Caliph: they were repaired at times by his\\nsuccessors.\\n</p><p>The Masjid al-Rayah\\xef\\xbf\\xbdof the Banner\\xef\\xbf\\xbdwas originally built by Al-Walid upon a\\nplace where the Prophet pitched his tent during the War of the Moat.\\nOthers call it Al-Zubab, after a hill upon which it stands. Al-Rayah is\\nseparated from the Masjid al-Fath by a rising ground called Jabal Sula\\nor Jabal Sawab[FN#39]: the former\\n</p><p>[p.49] being on the Eastern, whilst the latter lies upon the Western\\ndeclivity of the hill. The position of this place is greatly admired,\\nas commanding the fairest view of the Harim.\\n</p><p>About a mile and a half South-east of Al-Bakia is a dome called Kuwwat\\nIslam, the \\xef\\xbf\\xbdStrength of Al-Islam.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd Here the Apostle planted a dry\\npalm-stick, which grew up, blossomed, and bore fruit at once. Moreover,\\non one occasion when the Moslems were unable to perform the pilgrimage,\\nMohammed here produced the appearance of a Ka\\xef\\xbf\\xbdabah, an Arafat, and all\\nthe appurtenances of the Hajj.

See chapter xviii.\\n[FN#2] The word Hawamid is plural of Hamidah, Hawazin of Hazimi.\\n[FN#3] Anciently there was a Caravan from Maskat to Al-Madinah. My\\nfriends could not tell me when the line had been given up, but all were\\nagreed that for years they had not seen an Oman caravan, the pilgrims\\npreferring to enter Al-Hijaz via Jeddah.\\n[FN#4] According to Abulfeda, Khaybar is six stations N.E. of\\nAl-Madinah; it is four according to Al-Idrisi; but my informants\\nassured me that camels go there easily, as the Tarikh al-Khamisy says,\\nin three days. I should place it 80 miles N.N.E. of Al-Madinah.\\nAl-Atwal locates it in 65\\xef\\xbf\\xbd 20\\' E. lon., and 25\\xef\\xbf\\xbd 20\\' N. lat; Al-Kanun in\\nlon. 67\\xef\\xbf\\xbd 30\\', and lat. 24\\xef\\xbf\\xbd 20\\'; Ibn Sa\\xef\\xbf\\xbdid in lon. 64\\xef\\xbf\\xbd 56\\', and lat. 27\\xef\\xbf\\xbd; and\\nD\\xef\\xbf\\xbdAnville in lon. 57\\xef\\xbf\\xbd, and lat. 25\\xef\\xbf\\xbd. In Burckhardt\\xef\\xbf\\xbds map, and those copied from\\nit, Khaybar is placed about 2\\xef\\xbf\\xbd distant from Al-Madinah, which I believe\\nto be too far.\\n[FN#5] The Parliamentary limit of an officer\\xef\\xbf\\xbds leave from India is five\\nyears: if he overstay that period, he forfeits his commission.\\n{to me the comfort of reflecting that possibly at Meccah some\\nopportunity of crossing the Peninsula might present itself. At any rate\\nI had the certainty of seeing the strange wild country of the Hijaz,\\nand of being present at the ceremonies of the Holy City. I must request\\nthe reader to bear with a Visitation once more: we shall conclude it\\nwith a ride to Al-Bakia.[FN#6] This venerable spot is frequented by the\\npious every day after the prayer at the Prophet\\xef\\xbf\\xbds Tomb, and especially on\\nFridays.\\n[FN#6] The name means \\xef\\xbf\\xbdthe place of many roots.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd It is also called Bakia\\nAl-Gharkad\\xef\\xbf\\xbdthe place of many roots of the tree Rhamnus. Gharkad is\\ntranslated in different ways: some term it the lote, others the tree of\\nthe Jews (Forskal, sub voce).\\n[FN#7] See chapter xxi., ante.\\n[FN#8] The same is said of the Makbarah Benu Salmah or Salim, a\\ncemetery to the west of Al-Madinah, below rising ground called Jabal\\nSula. It has long ago been deserted. See chapter xiv.\\n[FN#9] In those days Al-Madinah had no walls, and was clear of houses\\non the East of the Harim.\\n[FN#10] These stones were removed by Al-Marwan, who determined that\\nOsman\\xef\\xbf\\xbds grave should not be distinguished from his fellows. For this act,\\nthe lieutenant of Mu\\xef\\xbf\\xbdawiyah was reproved and blamed by pious Moslems.\\n[FN#11] It ought to be high enough for the tenant to sit upright when\\nanswering the interrogatory angels.\\n[FN#12] Because of this superstition, in every part of Al-Islam, some\\ncontrivance is made to prevent the earth pressing upon the body.\\n[FN#13] This blessing is in Mohammed\\xef\\xbf\\xbds words, as the beauty of the Arabic\\nshows. Ayishah relates that in the month Safar, A.H. 11, one night the\\nProphet, who was beginning to suffer from the headache which caused his\\ndeath, arose from his couch, and walked out into the darkness;\\nwhereupon she followed him in a fit of jealousy, thinking he might be\\nabout to visit some other wife. He went to Al-Bakia, delivered the\\nabove benediction (which others give somewhat differently), raised his\\nhands three times, and turned to go home. Ayishah hurried back, but she\\ncould not conceal her agitation from her husband, who asked her what\\nshe had done. Upon her confessing her suspicions, he sternly informed\\nher that he had gone forth, by order of the Archangel Gabriel, to bless\\nand to intercede for the people of Al-Bakia. Some authors relate a more\\nfacetious termination of the colloquy.\\xef\\xbf\\xbdM.C. de Perceval (Essai, &amp;c., vol.\\niii. p. 314.)\\n[FN#14] \\xef\\xbf\\xbdLimping Osman,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd as the Persians contemptuously call him, was slain\\nby rebels, and therefore became a martyr according to the Sunnis. The\\nShi\\xef\\xbf\\xbdahs justify the murder, saying it was the act of an \\xef\\xbf\\xbdIjma al-Muslimin,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\nor the general consensus of Al-Islam, which in their opinion ratifies\\nan act of \\xef\\xbf\\xbdlynch law.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n[FN#15] This specifying the father Affan, proves him to have been a\\nMoslem. Abu Bakr\\xef\\xbf\\xbds father, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdKahafah,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd and Omar\\xef\\xbf\\xbds \\xef\\xbf\\xbdAl-Khattab,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd are not mentioned by\\nname in the Ceremonies of Visitation.\\n[FN#16] The Christian reader must remember that the Moslems rank\\nangelic nature, under certain conditions, below human nature.\\n[FN#17] Osman married two daughters of the Prophet, a circumstance\\nwhich the Sunnis quote as honourable to him: the Shi\\xef\\xbf\\xbdahs, on the\\ncontrary, declare that he killed them both by ill-treatment.\\n[FN#18] These men are generally descendants of the Saint whose tomb\\nthey own: they receive pensions from the Mudir of the Mosque, and\\nretain all fees presented to them by visitors. Some families are\\nrespectably supported in this way.\\n[FN#19] This woman, according to some accounts, also saved Mohammed\\xef\\xbf\\xbds\\nlife, when an Arab Kahin or diviner, foreseeing that the child was\\ndestined to subvert the national faith, urged the bystanders to bury\\ntheir swords in his bosom. The Sharifs of Meccah still entrust their\\nchildren to the Badawin, that they may be hardened by the discipline of\\nthe Desert. And the late Pasha of Egypt gave one of his sons in charge\\nof the Anizah tribe, near Akabah. Burckhardt (Travels in Arabia, vol.\\ni. p. 427) makes some sensible remarks about this custom, which cannot\\nbe too much praised.\\n[FN#20] Al- \\xef\\xbf\\xbdSadiyah,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd a double entendre; it means auspicious, and also\\nalludes to Halimah\\xef\\xbf\\xbds tribe, the Benu Sa\\xef\\xbf\\xbdad.\\n[FN#21] Both these words are titles of the Prophet.

I have\\nheard Hanafi Moslems, especially Sayyids, revile him; but this is not,\\nstrictly speaking, correct. The Shi\\xef\\xbf\\xbdahs, of course, place no limits to\\ntheir abuse of him. You first call a man \\xef\\xbf\\xbdOmar,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd then \\xef\\xbf\\xbdShimr,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd (the slayer of\\nAl-Hosayn), and lastly, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdYazid,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd beyond which insult does not extend.\\n[FN#25] Ukayl or Akil, as many write the name, died at Damascus, during\\nthe Caliphate of Al-Mu\\xef\\xbf\\xbdawiyah. Some say he was buried there, others that\\nhis corpse was transplanted to Al-Madinah, and buried in a place where\\nformerly his house, known as \\xef\\xbf\\xbdDar Ukayl,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd stood.\\n[FN#26] Some are of opinion that the ceremonies of Ziyarat formerly\\ndid, and still should begin here. But the order of visitation differs\\ninfinitely, and no two authors seem to agree. I was led by Shaykh\\nHamid, and indulged in no scruples.\\n[FN#27] Burckhardt makes a series of mistakes upon this subject. \\xef\\xbf\\xbdHassan\\nibn Aly, whose trunk only lies buried here (in El Bakia), his head\\nhaving been sent to Cairo, where it is preserved in the fine Mosque\\ncalled El-Hassanya.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd The Mosque Al-Hasanayn (the \\xef\\xbf\\xbdtwo Hasans\\xef\\xbf\\xbd) is supposed to\\ncontain only the head of Al-Hosayn, which, when the Crusaders took\\nAscalon, was brought from thence by Sultan Salih or Beybars, and\\nconveyed to Cairo. As I have said before, the Persians in Egypt openly\\nshow their contempt of this tradition. It must be remembered that\\nAl-Hasan died poisoned at Al-Madinah by his wife Ja\\xef\\xbf\\xbdadah. Al-Hosayn, on\\nthe other hand, was slain and decapitated at Kerbela. According to the\\nShi\\xef\\xbf\\xbdahs, Zayn al-Abidin obtained from Yazid, after a space of forty days,\\nhis father\\xef\\xbf\\xbds head, and carried it back to Kerbela, for which reason the\\nevent is known to the Persians as \\xef\\xbf\\xbdChilleyeh sar o tan,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd the \\xef\\xbf\\xbdforty days of\\n(separation between) the head and trunk.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd They vehemently deny that the\\nbody lies at Kerbela, and the head at Cairo. Others, again, declare\\nthat Al-Hosayn\\xef\\xbf\\xbds head was sent by Yazid to Amir bin al-As, the governor\\nof Al-Madinah, and was by him buried near Fatimah\\xef\\xbf\\xbds Tomb. Nor are they\\nwanting who declare, that after Yazid\\xef\\xbf\\xbds death the head was found in his\\ntreasury, and was shrouded and buried at Damascus. Such is the\\nuncertainty which hangs over the early history of Al-Islam[.]\\n[FN#28] The names of the fifth and sixth Imams, Mohammed al-Bakia and\\nJa\\xef\\xbf\\xbdafar al-Sadik, were omitted by Hamid, as doubtful whether they are\\nreally buried here or not.\\n[FN#29] Moslem historians seem to delight in the obscurity which hangs\\nover the lady\\xef\\xbf\\xbds last resting-place, as if it were an honour even for the\\nreceptacle of her ashes to be concealed from the eyes of men. Some\\nplace her in the Harim, relying upon this tradition: \\xef\\xbf\\xbdFatimah, feeling\\nabout to die, rose up joyfully, performed the greater ablution, dressed\\nherself in pure garments, spread a mat upon the floor of her house near\\nthe Prophet\\xef\\xbf\\xbds Tomb, lay down fronting the Kiblah, placed her hand under\\nher cheek, and said to her attendant, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdI am pure and in a pure dress; now\\nlet no one uncover my body, but bury me where I lie!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd When Ali returned\\nhe found his wife dead, and complied with her last wishes. Omar bin Abd\\nal-Aziz believed this tradition, when he included the room in the\\nMosque; and generally in Al-Islam Fatimah is supposed to be buried in\\nthe Harim. Those who suppose the Prophet\\xef\\xbf\\xbds daughter to be buried in\\nAl-Bakia rely upon a saying of the Imam Hasan, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdIf men will not allow me\\nto sleep beside my grandsire, place me in Al-Bakia, by my mother.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd They\\ngive the following account of his death and burial. His body was bathed\\nand shrouded by Ali and Omar Salmah. Others say that Asma Bint Umays,\\nthe wife of Abu Bakr, was present with Fatimah, who at her last hour\\ncomplained of being carried out, as was the custom of those days, to\\nburial like a man. Asma promised to make her a covered bier, like a\\nbride\\xef\\xbf\\xbds litter, of palm sticks, in shape like what she had seen in\\nAbyssinia: whereupon Fatimah smiled for the first time after her father\\xef\\xbf\\xbds\\ndeath, and exacted from her a promise to allow no one entrance as long\\nas her corpse was in the house. Ayishah, shortly afterwards knocking at\\nthe door, was refused admittance by Asma; the former complained of this\\nto her father, and declared that her stepmother had been making a bride\\xef\\xbf\\xbds\\nlitter to carry out the corpse. Abu Bakr went to the door, and when\\ninformed by his wife that all was the result of Fatimah\\xef\\xbf\\xbds orders, he\\nreturned home making no objection. The death of the Prophet\\xef\\xbf\\xbds daughter\\nwas concealed by her own desire from high and low; she was buried at\\nnight, and none accompanied her bier, or prayed at her grave, except\\nAli and a few relatives. The Shi\\xef\\xbf\\xbdahs found a charge of irreverence and\\ndisrespect against Abu Bakr for absence on this occasion. The third\\nplace which claims Fatimah\\xef\\xbf\\xbds honoured remains, is a small Mosque in\\nAl-Bakia, South of the Sepulchre of Abbas. It was called Bayt\\nal-Huzn\\xef\\xbf\\xbdHouse of Mourning\\xef\\xbf\\xbdbecause here the lady passed the end of her days,\\nlamenting the loss of her father. Her tomb appears to have formerly\\nbeen shown there. Now visitors pray, and pray only twice,\\xef\\xbf\\xbdat the Harim,\\nand in the Kubbat al-Abbasiyah.\\n[FN#30] The other celebrities in Al-Bakia are:\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n</p><p>Fatimah bint As\\xef\\xbf\\xbdad, mother of Ali. She was buried with great religious\\npomp. The Prophet shrouded her with his own garment (to prevent hell\\nfrom touching her), dug her grave, lay down in it (that it might never\\nsqueeze or be narrow to her), assisted in carrying the bier, prayed\\nover her, and proclaimed her certain of future felicity. Over her tomb\\nwas written, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdThe grave hath not closed upon one like Fatimah, daughter\\nof As\\xef\\xbf\\xbdad.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd Historians relate that Mohammed lay down in only four graves: 1.\\nKhadijah\\xef\\xbf\\xbds, at Meccah. 2. Kasim\\xef\\xbf\\xbds, her son by him. 3. That of Umm Ruman,\\nAyishah\\xef\\xbf\\xbds mother. 4. That of Abdullah al-Mazni, a friend and companion.\\n</p><p>Abd al-Rahman bin Auf was interred near Osman bin Maz\\xef\\xbf\\xbdun. Ayishah offered\\nto bury him in her house near the Prophet, but he replied that he did\\nnot wish to narrow her abode, and that he had promised to sleep by the\\nside of his friend Maz\\xef\\xbf\\xbdun. I have already alluded to the belief that none\\nhas been able to occupy the spare place in the Hujrah.\\n</p><p>Ibn Hufazah al-Sahmi, who was one of the Ashab al-Hijratayn (who had\\naccompanied both flights, the greater and the lesser), here died of a\\nwound received at Ohod, and was buried in Shawwal, A.H. 3, one month\\nafter Osman bin Maz\\xef\\xbf\\xbdun.\\n</p><p>Abdullah bin Mas\\xef\\xbf\\xbdud, who, according to others, is buried at Kufah.\\n</p><p>Sa\\xef\\xbf\\xbdad ibn Zararah, interred near Osman bin Maz\\xef\\xbf\\xbdun.\\n</p><p>Sa\\xef\\xbf\\xbdad bin Ma\\xef\\xbf\\xbdaz, who was buried by the Prophet.

He was buried\\nnear Abdullah bin Ja\\xef\\xbf\\xbdafar al-Tayyar, popularly known as the \\xef\\xbf\\xbdmost generous\\nof the Arabs,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd and near Ukayl bin Abi Talib, the brother of Ali mentioned\\nabove.\\n</p><p>These are the principal names mentioned by popular authors. The curious\\nreader will find in old histories a multitude of others, whose graves\\nare now utterly forgotten at Al-Madinah.\\n[FN#31] See chapter xix.\\n[FN#32] The story is related in another way. Whilst Mohammed was\\npraying the Asr or afternoon prayer at the Harim he turned his face\\ntowards Meccah. Some of the Companions ran instantly to all the\\nMosques, informing the people of the change. In many places they were\\nnot listened to, but the Benu Salmah who were at prayer instantly faced\\nSouthwards. To commemorate their obedience the Mosque was called\\nAl-Kiblatayn.\\n[FN#33] I cannot say whether this valuable stone be still at the Mosque\\nBenu Tifr. But I perfectly remember that my friend Larking had a\\nmutilated sphynx in his garden at Alexandria, which was found equally\\nefficacious.\\n[FN#34] See chapter xvii.\\n[FN#35] Mohammed\\xef\\xbf\\xbds eldest son was Kasim, who died in his infancy, and was\\nburied at Meccah. Hence the Prophet\\xef\\xbf\\xbds p\\xef\\xbf\\xbddonymic, Abu Kasim, the sire of\\nKasim.\\n[FB#36] Ayishah used to relate that she was exceedingly jealous of the\\nCoptic girl\\xef\\xbf\\xbds beauty, and of the Prophet\\xef\\xbf\\xbds love for her. Mohammed seeing\\nthis, removed Mariyah from the house of Harisat bin al-Numan, in which\\nhe had placed her, to the Awali of Al-Madinah, where the Mosque now is.\\nOriental authors use this term \\xef\\xbf\\xbdAwali,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd high-grounds, to denote the plains\\nto the Eastward and Southward of the City, opposed to Al-Safilah, the\\nlower ground on the W. and N.W.\\n[FN#37] I am very doubtful about this location of the Masjid al-Fath.\\n[FN#38] A magus, a magician, one supposed to worship fire.

I had intended to stay at Al-Madinah till the last moment,\\nand to accompany the Kafilat al-Tayyarah, or the \\xef\\xbf\\xbdFlying Caravan,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd which\\nusually leaves on the 2nd Zu\\xef\\xbf\\xbdl Hijjah, two days after that of Damascus.\\n</p><p>Suddenly arose the rumour that there would be no Tayyarah,[FN#l] and\\nthat all pilgrims must proceed with the Damascus Caravan or await the\\nRakb. This is a Dromedary Caravan, in which each person carries only\\nhis saddle-bags. It usually descends by the road called Al-Khabt, and\\nmakes Meccah on the fifth day. The Sharif Zayd, Sa\\xef\\xbf\\xbdad the Robber\\xef\\xbf\\xbds only\\nfriend, had paid him an unsuccessful visit. Schinderhans demanded back\\nhis Shaykh-ship, in return for a safe-conduct through his country:\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbdOtherwise,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd said he, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdI will cut the throat of every hen that ventures into\\nthe passes.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n</p><p>The Sharif Zayd returned to Al-Madinah on the 25th Zu\\xef\\xbf\\xbdl Ka\\xef\\xbf\\xbdadah (30th\\nAugust). Early on the morning of the next day, Shaykh Hamid returned\\nhurriedly from the bazar, exclaiming, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdYou must make ready at once,\\nEffendi!\\xef\\xbf\\xbdthere will be no Tayyarah\\xef\\xbf\\xbdall Hajis start to-morrow\\xef\\xbf\\xbdAllah will make\\nit easy to you!\\xef\\xbf\\xbdhave you\\n</p><p>[p.51] your water-skins in order?\\xef\\xbf\\xbdyou are to travel down the Darb\\nal-Sharki, where you will not see water for three days!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n</p><p>Poor Hamid looked horrorstruck as he concluded this fearful\\nannouncement, which filled me with joy. Burckhardt had visited and had\\ndescribed the Darb al-Sultani, the road along the coast. But no\\nEuropean had as yet travelled down by Harun al-Rashid\\xef\\xbf\\xbds and the Lady\\nZubaydah\\xef\\xbf\\xbds celebrated route through the Nijd Desert.\\n</p><p>Not a moment, however, was to be lost: we expected to start early the\\nnext morning. The boy Mohammed went forth, and bought for eighty\\npiastres a Shugduf, which lasted us throughout the pilgrimage, and for\\nfifteen piastres a Shibriyah or cot to be occupied by Shaykh Nur, who\\ndid not relish sleeping on boxes. The youth was employed all day, with\\nsleeves tucked up, and working like a porter, in covering the litter\\nwith matting and rugs, in mending broken parts, and in providing it\\nwith large pockets for provisions inside and outside, with pouches to\\ncontain the gugglets of cooled water.\\n</p><p>Meanwhile Shaykh Nur and I, having inspected the water-skins, found\\nthat the rats had made considerable rents in two of them. There being\\nno workman procurable at this time for gold, I sat down to patch the\\ndamaged articles; whilst Nur was sent to lay in supplies for fourteen\\ndays. The journey is calculated at eleven days; but provisions are apt\\nto spoil, and the Badawi camel-men expect to be fed. Besides which,\\npilferers abound. By my companion\\xef\\xbf\\xbds advice I took wheat-flour, rice,\\nturmeric, onions, dates, unleavened bread of two kinds, cheese, limes,\\ntobacco, sugar, tea and coffee.\\n</p><p>Hamid himself started upon the most important part of our business.\\nFaithful camel-men are required upon a road where robberies are\\nfrequent and stabbings occasional, and where there is no law to prevent\\ndesertion or to limit new and exorbitant demands. After a time he\\n</p><p>[p.52] returned, accompanied by a boy and a Badawi, a short, thin,\\nwell-built old man with regular features, a white beard, and a cool\\nclear eye; his limbs, as usual, were scarred with wounds. Mas\\xef\\xbf\\xbdud of the\\nRahlah, a sub-family of the Hamidah family of the Benu-Harb, came in\\nwith a dignified demeanour, applied his dexter palm to ours,[FN#2] sat\\ndown, declined a pipe, accepted coffee, and after drinking it, looked\\nat us to show that he was ready for nego[t]iation. We opened the\\nproceedings with \\xef\\xbf\\xbdWe want men, and not camels,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd and the conversation\\nproceeded in the purest Hijazi.[FN#3] After much discussion, we agreed,\\nif compelled to travel by the Darb al-Sharki, to pay twenty dollars for\\ntwo camels,[FN#4] and to advance Arbun, or earnest-money, to half that\\namount.[FN#5] The Shaykh bound himself to provide us with good animals,\\nwhich, moreover, were to be changed in case of accidents: he was also\\nto supply his beasts with water, and to accompany us to Arafat and\\nback. But, absolutely refusing to carry my large chest, he declared\\nthat the tent under the Shugduf was burden enough for one camel; and\\nthat the green box of drugs, the saddle-bags, and the provision-sacks,\\nsurmounted by Nur\\xef\\xbf\\xbds cot, were amply sufficient for the other. On our\\npart, we bound ourselves to feed the\\n</p><p>[p.53] Shaykh and his son, supplying them either with raw or with\\ncooked provender, and, upon our return to Meccah from Mount Arafat, to\\npay the remaining hire with a discretionary present.\\n</p><p>Hamid then addressed to me flowery praises of the old Badawi. After\\nwhich, turning to the latter, he exclaimed, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdThou wilt treat these\\nfriends well, O Mas\\xef\\xbf\\xbdud the Harbi!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd The ancient replied with a dignity that\\nhad no pomposity in it,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\xef\\xbf\\xbdEven as Abu Shawarib\\xef\\xbf\\xbdthe Father of\\nMustachios[FN#6]\\xef\\xbf\\xbdbehaveth to us, so will we behave to him!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd He then arose,\\nbade us be prepared when the departure-gun sounded, saluted us, and\\nstalked out of the room, followed by his son, who, under pretext of\\ndozing, had mentally made an inventory of every article in the room,\\nourselves especially included.\\n</p><p>When the Badawin disappeared, Shaykh Hamid shook his head, advising me\\nto give them plenty to eat, and never to allow twenty-four hours to\\nelapse without dipping hand in the same dish with them, in order that\\nthe party might always be \\xef\\xbf\\xbdMalihin,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\xef\\xbf\\xbdon terms of salt.[FN#7] He concluded\\n</p><p>[p.54] with a copious lecture upon the villainy of Badawin, and on\\ntheir habit of drinking travellers\\xef\\xbf\\xbd water. I was to place the skins on a\\ncamel in front, and not behind; to hang them with their mouths\\ncarefully tied, and turned upwards, contrary to the general practice;\\nalways to keep a good store of liquid, and at night to place it under\\nthe safeguard of the tent.\\n</p><p>In the afternoon, Omar Effendi and others dropped in to take leave.\\nThey found me in the midst of preparations, sewing sacks, fitting up a\\npipe, patching water-bags, and packing medicines. My fellow-traveller\\nhad brought me some pencils[FN#8] and a penknife, as \\xef\\xbf\\xbdforget-me-nots,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd for\\nwe were by no means sure of meeting again. He hinted, however, at\\nanother escape from the paternal abode, and proposed, if possible, to\\njoin the Dromedary-Caravan. Shaykh Hamid said the same, but I saw, by\\nthe expression of his face, that his mother and wife would not give him\\nleave from home so soon after his return.\\n</p><p>Towards evening-time the Barr al-Manakhah became a scene of exceeding\\nconfusion. The town of tents lay upon the ground. Camels were being\\nladen, and were roaring under the weight of litters and cots, boxes and\\nbaggage. Horses and mules galloped about. Men were rushing wildly in\\nall directions on worldly errands, or hurrying to pay a farewell visit\\nto the Prophet\\xef\\xbf\\xbds Tomb. Women and children sat screaming on the ground, or\\nran to and fro distracted, or called their vehicles to escape the\\ndanger of being crushed. Every now and then a random shot excited all\\ninto the belief that the departure-gun had sounded. At times we heard a\\nvolley from the robbers\\xef\\xbf\\xbd hills, which elicited a general groan, for the\\npilgrims were still, to use their own phrase, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdbetween fear\\n</p><p>[p.55] and hope,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd and, consequently, still far from \\xef\\xbf\\xbdone of the two\\ncomforts.[FN#9]\\xef\\xbf\\xbd Then would sound the loud \\xef\\xbf\\xbdJhin-Jhin\\xef\\xbf\\xbd of the camels\\xef\\xbf\\xbd bells, as\\nthe stately animals paced away with some grandee\\xef\\xbf\\xbds gilt and emblazoned\\nlitter, the sharp plaint of the dromedary, and the loud neighing of\\nexcited steeds.\\n</p><p>About an hour after sunset all our preparations were concluded, save\\nonly the Shugduf, at which the boy Mohammed still worked with untiring\\nzeal; he wisely remembered that he had to spend in it the best portion\\nof a week and a half. The evening was hot, we therefore dined outside\\nthe house. I was told to repair to the Harim for the Ziyarat al-Wida\\xef\\xbf\\xbda,\\nor the \\xef\\xbf\\xbdFarewell Visitation\\xef\\xbf\\xbd; but my decided objection to this step was\\nthat we were all to part,\\xef\\xbf\\xbdhow soon!\\xef\\xbf\\xbdand when to meet again we knew not. My\\ncompanions smiled consent, assuring me that the ceremony could be\\nperformed as well at a distance as in the temple.\\n</p><p>Then Shaykh Hamid made me pray a two-bow prayer, and afterwards, facing\\ntowards the Harim, to recite this supplication with raised hands:\\n</p><p>\\xef\\xbf\\xbdO Apostle of Allah, we beg Thee to entreat Almighty Allah, that He cut\\noff no Portion of the Good resulting to us, from this Visit to Thee and\\nto Thy Harim! May He cause us to return safe and prosperous to our\\nBirth-places; aid then us in the Progeny he hath given us, and continue\\nto us his Benefits, and make us thankful for our daily Bread! O Allah,\\nlet not this be the last of our Visitations to Thy Apostle\\'s Tomb! Yet\\nif Thou summon us before such Blessing, verily in my Death I bear\\nWitness, as in my Life,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd (here the forefinger of the right hand is\\nextended, that the members of the body may take part with the tongue\\nand the heart) \\xef\\xbf\\xbdthat there\\n</p><p>[p.56] is no god but Allah, One and without Partner, and verily that\\nour Lord Mohammed is His Servant and His Apostle! O Allah, grant us in\\nthis World Weal, and in the future Weal, and save us from the torments\\nof Hell-fire! Praise to Thee, O Lord, Lord of Glory, greater than Man\\ncan describe! and Peace be upon the Apostle, and Laud to Allah, the\\nLord of the (three) Worlds.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd This concludes, as usual, with the\\nTestification and the Fatihah. Pious men on such an occasion go to the\\nRauzah, where they strive, if possible, to shed a tear,\\xef\\xbf\\xbda single drop\\nbeing a sign of acceptance,\\xef\\xbf\\xbdgive alms to the utmost of their ability, vow\\npiety, repentance, and obedience, and retire overwhelmed with grief, at\\nseparating themselves from their Prophet and Intercessor. It is\\ncustomary, too, before leaving Al-Madinah, to pass at least one night\\nin vigils at the Harim, and for learned men to read through the Koran\\nonce before the tomb.\\n</p><p>Then began the uncomfortable process of paying off little bills. The\\nEastern creditor always, for divers reasons, waits the last moment\\nbefore he claims his debt. Shaykh Hamid had frequently hinted at his\\ndifficulties; the only means of escape from which, he said, was to rely\\nupon Allah. He had treated me so hospitably, that I could not take back\\nany part of the \\xef\\xbf\\xbd5 lent to him at Suez. His three brothers received a\\ndollar or two each, and one or two of his cousins hinted to some effect\\nthat such a proceeding would meet with their approbation.\\n</p><p>The luggage was then carried down, and disposed in packs upon the\\nground before the house, so as to be ready for loading at a moment\\xef\\xbf\\xbds\\nnotice. Many flying parties of travellers had almost started on the\\nhigh road, and late in the evening came a new report that the body of\\nthe Caravan would march about midnight. We sat up till about two A.M.,\\nwhen, having heard no gun, and having seen no camels, we lay down to\\nsleep through the sultry remnant of the hours of darkness.\\n</p><p>[p.57]Thus, gentle reader, was spent my last night at Al-Madinah.\\n</p><p>I had reason to congratulate myself upon having passed through the\\nfirst danger. Meccah is so near the coast, that, in case of detection,\\nthe traveller might escape in a few hours to Jeddah, where he would\\nfind an English Vice-Consul, protection from the Turkish authorities,\\nand possibly a British cruiser in the harbour. But at Al-Madinah\\ndiscovery would entail more serious consequences. The next risk to be\\nrun was the journey between the two cities, where it would be easy for\\nthe local officials quietly to dispose of a suspected person by giving\\na dollar to a Badawi.\\n</p><p>[FN#1] The \\xef\\xbf\\xbdTayyarah,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd or \\xef\\xbf\\xbdFlying Caravan,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd is lightly laden, and travels by\\nforced marches.\\n[FN#2] This \\xef\\xbf\\xbdMusafahah,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd as it is called, is the Arab fashion of shaking\\nhands. They apply the palms of the right hands flat to each other,\\nwithout squeezing the fingers, and then raise the hand to the forehead.\\n[FN#3] On this occasion I heard three new words: \\xef\\xbf\\xbdKharitah,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd used to\\nsignify a single trip to Meccah (without return to Al-Madinah), \\xef\\xbf\\xbdTa\\xef\\xbf\\xbdarifah,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\ngoing out from Meccah to Mount Arafat, and \\xef\\xbf\\xbdTanzilah,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd return from Mount\\nArafat to Meccah.\\n[FN#4] And part of an extra animal which was to carry water for the\\nparty. Had we travelled by the Darb al-Sultani, we should have paid 6\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\ndollars, instead of 10, for each beast.\\n[FN#5] The system of advances, as well as earnest money, is common all\\nover Arabia. In some places, Aden for instance, I have heard of\\ntwo-thirds the price of a cargo of coffee being required from the\\npurchaser before the seller would undertake to furnish a single bale.\\n[FN#6] Most men of the Shafe\\xef\\xbf\\xbdi school clip their mustachios exceedingly\\nshort; some clean shave the upper lip, the imperial, and the parts of\\nthe beard about the corners of the mouth, and the forepart of the\\ncheeks. I neglected so to do, which soon won for me the epithet\\nrecorded above. Arabs are vastly given to \\xef\\xbf\\xbdnick-naming God\\xef\\xbf\\xbds creatures\\xef\\xbf\\xbd;\\ntheir habit is the effect of acute observation, and the want of variety\\nin proper names. Sonnini appears not to like having been called the\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbdFather of a nose.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd But there is nothing disrespectful in these personal\\nallusions. In Arabia you must be \\xef\\xbf\\xbdfather\\xef\\xbf\\xbd of something, and it is better to\\nbe father of a feature, than father of a cooking pot, or father of a\\nstrong smell (\\xef\\xbf\\xbdAbu-Zirt.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd)\\n[FN#7] Salt among the Hindus is considered the essence and preserver of\\nthe seas; it was therefore used in their offerings to the gods. The old\\nidea in Europe was, that salt is a body composed of various elements,\\ninto which it cannot be resolved by human means: hence, it became the\\ntype of an indissoluble tie between individuals. Homer calls salt\\nsacred and divine, and whoever ate it with a stranger was supposed to\\nbecome his friend. By the Greek authors, as by the Arabs, hospitality\\nand salt are words expressing a kindred idea. When describing the\\nBadawin of Al-Hijaz, I shall have occasion to notice their peculiar\\nnotions of the Salt-law.\\n[FN#8] The import of such articles shows the march of progress in\\nAl-Hijaz. During the last generation, schoolmasters used for pencils\\nbits of bar lead beaten to a point.\\n[FN#9] The \\xef\\xbf\\xbdtwo comforts\\xef\\xbf\\xbd are success and despair; the latter, according to\\nthe Arabs, being a more enviable state of feeling than doubt or hope\\ndeferred.\\n</p>\\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Chapter_XXIV._FROM_AL-MADINAH_TO_AL-SUWAYRKIYAH.\">Chapter XXIV.

The [\\xef\\xbf\\xbd]Darb al-Sultani,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd or\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbdSultan\\xef\\xbf\\xbds Highway,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd follows the line of coast: this general passage has been\\nminutely described by my exact predecessor. The \\xef\\xbf\\xbdTarik al-Ghabir,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd a\\nmountain path, is avoided by the Mahmil and the great Caravans on\\naccount of its rugged passes; water abounds along the whole line, but\\nthere is not a single village and the Sobh Badawin, who own the soil[,]\\nare inveterate plunderers. The route called \\xef\\xbf\\xbdWady al-Kura\\xef\\xbf\\xbd is a favourite\\nwith Dromedary Caravans; on this road are two or three small\\nsettlements, regular wells, and free passage through the Benu Amr\\ntribe. The Darb al-Sharki, or \\xef\\xbf\\xbdEastern road,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd down which I travelled, owes\\nits existence to the piety of the Lady Zubaydah, wife of Harun\\nal-Rashid. That munificent princess dug wells from Baghdad to\\nAl-Madinah, and built, we are told, a wall to direct pilgrims over the\\nshifting sands.[FN#1] There is a fifth road, or rather mountain path,\\nconcerning which I can give no information.\\n</p><p>At eight A.M. on Wednesday, the 26th Zu\\xef\\xbf\\xbdl Ka\\xef\\xbf\\xbdadah\\n</p><p>[p.59] (31st August, 1853), as we were sitting at the window of Hamid\\xef\\xbf\\xbds\\nhouse after our early meal, suddenly appeared, in hottest haste, Mas\\xef\\xbf\\xbdud,\\nour Camel-Shaykh. He was accompanied by his son, a bold boy about\\nfourteen years of age, who fought sturdily about the weight of each\\npackage as it was thrown over the camel\\xef\\xbf\\xbds back; and his nephew, an ugly\\npock-marked lad, too lazy even to quarrel. We were ordered to lose no\\ntime in loading; all started into activity, and at nine A.M. I found\\nmyself standing opposite the Egyptian Gate, surrounded by my friends,\\nwho had accompanied me thus far on foot, to take leave with due honour.\\nAfter affectionate embraces and parting mementoes, we mounted, the boy\\nMohammed and I in the litter, and Shaykh Nur in his cot. Then in\\ncompany with some Turks and Meccans, for Mas\\xef\\xbf\\xbdud owned a string of nine\\ncamels, we passed through the little gate near the castle, and shaped\\nour course towards the North. On our right lay the palm-groves, which\\nconceal this part of the city; far to the left rose the domes of Hamzah\\xef\\xbf\\xbds\\nMosques at the foot of Mount Ohod; and in front a band of road, crowded\\nwith motley groups, stretched over a barren stony plain.\\n</p><p>After an hour\\xef\\xbf\\xbds slow march, bending gradually from North to North-East,\\nwe fell into the Nijd highway, and came to a place of renown called\\nAl-Ghadir, or the Basin.[FN#2] This is a depression conducting the\\ndrainage of the plain towards the northern hills. The skirts of Ohod\\nstill limited the prospect to the left. On the right was the Bir Rashid\\n(Well of Rashid), and the little whitewashed dome of Ali al-Urays, a\\ndescendant from Zayn al-Abidin:\\xef\\xbf\\xbdthe tomb is still a place of Visitation.\\nThere we halted and turned to take farewell of the Holy City. All the\\n</p><p>[p.60] pilgrims dismounted and gazed at the venerable minarets and the\\nGreen Dome,\\xef\\xbf\\xbdspots upon which their memories would for ever dwell with a\\nfond and yearning interest.\\n</p><p>Remounting at noon, we crossed a Fiumara which runs, according to my\\nCamel-Shaykh, from North to South; we were therefore emerging from the\\nMadinah basin. The sky began to be clouded, and although the air was\\nstill full of Samu[m], cold draughts occasionally poured down from the\\nhills. Arabs fear this\\n</p><p>\\xef\\xbf\\xbdbitter change\\nOf fierce extremes, extremes by change more fierce,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n</p><p>and call that a dangerous climate which is cold in the hot season and\\nhot in the cold. Travelling over a rough and stony path, dotted with\\nthorny Acacias, we arrived about two P.M. at the bed of lava heard of\\nby Burckhardt.[FN#3] The\\n</p><p>[p.61] aspect of the country was volcanic, abounding in basalts and\\nscoriae, more or less porous: sand veiled the black bed whose present\\ndimensions by no means equal the descriptions of Arabian historians. I\\nmade diligent enquiries about the existence of active volcanoes in this\\npart of Al-Hijaz, and heard of none.\\n</p><p>At five P.M., travelling towards the East, we entered a Bughaz,[FN#4]\\nor Pass, which follows the course of a wide Fiumara, walled in by steep\\nand barren hills,\\xef\\xbf\\xbdthe portals of a region too wild even for Badawin. The\\ntorrent-bed narrowed where the turns were abrupt, and the drift of\\nheavy stones, with a water-mark from six to seven feet\\n</p><p>[p.62] high, showed that after rains a violent stream runs from East\\nand South-East to West and North-West. The fertilising fluid is close\\nto the surface, evidenced by a spare growth of Acacia, camel-grass, and\\nat some angles of the bed by the Daum, or Theban palm.[FN#5] I remarked\\nwhat was technically called \\xef\\xbf\\xbdHufrah,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd holes dug for water in the sand; and\\nthe guide assured me that somewhere near there is a spring flowing from\\nthe rocks.\\n</p><p>After the long and sultry afternoon, beasts of burden began to sink in\\nnumbers. The fresh carcases of asses, ponies, and camels dotted the\\nwayside: those that had been allowed to die were abandoned to the foul\\ncarrion-birds, the Rakham (vulture), and the yellow Ukab; and all whose\\nthroats had been properly cut, were surrounded by troops of Takruri\\npilgrims. These half-starved wretches cut steaks from the choice\\nportions, and slung them over their shoulders till an opportunity of\\ncooking might arrive. I never saw men more destitute. They carried\\nwooden bowls, which they filled with water by begging; their only\\nweapon was a small knife, tied in a leathern sheath above the elbow;\\nand their costume an old skull-cap, strips of leather like sandals\\nunder the feet, and a long dirty shirt, or sometimes a mere rag\\ncovering the loins. Some were perfect savages, others had been\\nfine-looking men, broad-shouldered, thin-flanked, and long-limbed; many\\nwere lamed by fatigue and by thorns; and looking at most of them, I\\nfancied death depicted in their forms and features.\\n</p><p>After two hours\\xef\\xbf\\xbd slow marching up the Fiumara eastwards, we saw in front\\nof us a wall of rock; and, turning abruptly southwards, we left the\\nbed, and ascended rising ground. Already it was night; an hour,\\nhowever, elapsed before we saw, at a distance, the twinkling fires, and\\nheard the watch-cries of our camp. It was\\n</p><p>[p.63] pitched in a hollow, under hills, in excellent order; the Pasha\\xef\\xbf\\xbds\\npavilion surrounded by his soldiers and guards disposed in tents, with\\nsentinels, regularly posted, protecting the outskirts of the\\nencampment. One of our men, whom we had sent forward, met us on the\\nway, and led us to an open place, where we unloaded the camels, raised\\nour canvas home, lighted fires, and prepared, with supper, for a good\\nnight\\xef\\xbf\\xbds rest. Living is simple on such marches. The pouches inside and\\noutside the Shugduf contain provisions and water, with which you supply\\nyourself when inclined. At certain hours of the day, ambulant vendors\\noffer sherbet, lemonade, hot coffee, and water-pipes admirably\\nprepared.[FN#6] Chibuks may be smoked in the litter; but few care to do\\nso during the Samu[m]. The first thing, however, called for at the\\nhalting-place is the pipe, and its delightfully soothing influence,\\nfollowed by a cup of coffee, and a \\xef\\xbf\\xbdforty winks\\xef\\xbf\\xbd upon the sand, will awaken\\nan appetite not to be roused by other means. How could Waterton, the\\ntraveller, abuse a pipe? During the night-halt, provisions are cooked:\\nrice, or Kichri, a mixture of pulse and rice, is eaten with Chutnee and\\nlime-pickle, varied, occasionally, by tough mutton and indigestible\\ngoat.\\n</p><p>We arrived at Ja al-Sharifah at eight P.M., after a march of about\\ntwenty-two miles.[FN#7] This halting-place is\\n</p><p>[p.64] the rendezvous of Caravans: it lies 50\\xef\\xbf\\xbd south-east of Al-Madinah,\\nand belongs rather to Nijd than to Al-Hijaz.\\n</p><p>At three A.M., on Thursday (Sept. 1), we started up at the sound of the\\ndeparture-gun, struck the tent, loaded the camels, mounted, and found\\nourselves hurrying through a gloomy pass, in the hills, to secure a\\ngood place in the Caravan. This is an object of some importance, as,\\nduring the whole journey, marching order must not be broken. We met\\nwith a host of minor accidents, camels falling, Shugdufs bumping\\nagainst one another, and plentiful abuse. Pertinaciously we hurried on\\ntill six A.M., at which hour we emerged from the Black Pass. The large\\ncrimson sun rose upon us, disclosing, through purple mists, a hollow of\\ncoarse yellow gravel, based upon a hard whitish clay. About five miles\\nbroad by twelve long, it collects the waters of the high grounds after\\nrain, and distributes the surplus through an exit towards the\\nNorth-west, a gap in the low undulating hills around. Entering it, we\\ndismounted, prayed, broke our fast, and after half an hour\\xef\\xbf\\xbds halt\\nproceeded to cross its breadth. The appearance of the Caravan was most\\nstriking, as it threaded its slow way over the smooth surface of the\\nKhabt (low plain).[FN#8] To judge by the eye, the host was composed of\\nat fewest seven thousand souls, on foot, on horseback, in litters, or\\nbestriding the splendid camels of Syria.[FN#9] There were eight\\ngradations of pilgrims.\\n</p><p>[p.65] The lowest hobbled with heavy staves. Then came the riders of\\nasses, of camels, and of mules. Respectable men, especially Arabs, were\\nmounted on dromedaries, and the soldiers had horses: a led animal was\\nsaddled for every grandee, ready whenever he might wish to leave his\\nlitter. Women, children, and invalids of the poorer classes sat upon a\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbdHaml Musattah,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\xef\\xbf\\xbdrugs and cloths spread over the two large boxes which form\\nthe camel\\xef\\xbf\\xbds load.[FN#10] Many occupied Shibriyahs; a few, Shugdufs, and\\nonly the wealthy and the noble rode in Takht-rawan (litters), carried\\nby camels or mules.[FN#11] The morning beams fell brightly upon the\\nglancing arms which surrounded the stripped Mahmil,[FN#12] and upon the\\nscarlet and gilt conveyances of the grandees. Not the least beauty of\\nthe spectacle was its wondrous variety of detail: no man was dressed\\nlike his neighbour, no camel was caparisoned, no horse was\\n</p><p>[p.66] clothed in uniform, as it were. And nothing stranger than the\\ncontrasts; a band of half-naked Takruri marching with the Pasha\\xef\\xbf\\xbds\\nequipage, and long-capped, bearded Persians conversing with Tarbush\\xef\\xbf\\xbdd and\\nshaven Turks.\\n</p><p>The plain even at an early hour reeked with vapours distilled by the\\nfires of the Samum: about noon, however, the air became cloudy, and\\nnothing of colour remained, save that milky white haze, dull, but\\nglaring withal, which is the prevailing day-tint in these regions. At\\nmid-day we reached a narrowing of the basin, where, from both sides, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdIrk,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\nor low hills, stretch their last spurs into the plain. But after half a\\nmile, it again widened to upwards of two miles. At two P.M. (Friday,\\nSept. 2), we turned towards the South-west, ascended stony ground, and\\nfound ourselves one hour afterwards in a desolate rocky flat, distant\\nabout twenty-four miles of unusually winding road from our last\\nstation. \\xef\\xbf\\xbdMahattah Ghurab,[FN#13]\\xef\\xbf\\xbd or the Raven\\xef\\xbf\\xbds Station, lies 10\\xef\\xbf\\xbd south-west\\nfrom Ja al-Sharifah, in the irregular masses of hill on the frontier of\\nAl-Hijaz, where the highlands of Nijd begin.\\n</p><p><br />\\nAfter pitching the tent, we prepared to recruit our supply of water;\\nfor Mas\\xef\\xbf\\xbdud warned me that his camels had not drunk for ninety hours, and\\nthat they would soon sink under the privation. The boy Mohammed,\\nmounting a dromedary, set off with the Shaykh and many water-bags,\\ngiving me an opportunity of writing out my journal. They did not return\\nhome until after nightfall, a delay caused by many adventures. The\\nwells are in a Fiumara, as usual, about two miles distant from the\\nhalting-place, and the soldiers, regular as well as irregular, occupied\\nthe water and exacted hard coin in exchange for it. The men are not to\\nblame; they would die of starvation but for this resource. The boy\\nMohammed had been engaged in several quarrels; but after\\n</p><p>[p.67] snapping his pistol at a Persian pilgrim\\xef\\xbf\\xbds head, he came forth\\ntriumphant with two skins of sweetish water, for which we paid ten\\npiastres. He was in his glory. There were many Meccans in the Caravan,\\namong them his elder brother and several friends: the Sharif Zayd had\\nsent, he said, to ask why he did not travel with his compatriots. That\\nevening he drank so copiously of clarified butter, and ate dates mashed\\nwith flour and other abominations to such an extent, that at night he\\nprepared to give up the ghost.\\n</p><p>We passed a pleasant hour or two before sleeping. I began to like the\\nold Shaykh Mas\\xef\\xbf\\xbdud, who, seeing it, entertained me with his genealogy, his\\nbattles, and his family affairs. The rest of the party could not\\nprevent expressing contempt when they heard me putting frequent\\nquestions about torrents, hills, Badawin, and the directions of places.\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbdLet the Father of Moustachios ask and learn,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd said the old man; \\xef\\xbf\\xbdhe is\\nfriendly with the Badawin,[FN#14] and knows better than you all.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd This\\nreproof was intended to be bitter as the poet\\xef\\xbf\\xbds satire,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n</p><p>\\xef\\xbf\\xbdAll fools have still an itching to deride,\\n</p>\\n<pre> And fain would be upon the laughing side.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n</pre>\\n<p>It called forth, however[,] another burst of merriment, for the jeerers\\nremembered my nickname to have belonged to that pestilent heretic, Sa\\xef\\xbf\\xbdud\\nthe Wahhabi.\\n</p><p>On Saturday, the 3rd September, the hateful signal-gun awoke us at one\\nA.M. In Arab travel there is nothing more disagreeable than the Sariyah\\nor night-march, and yet the people are inexorable about it. \\xef\\xbf\\xbdChoose early\\nDarkness (daljah) for your Wayfarings,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd said the Prophet, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdas the\\nCalamities of the Earth (serpents and wild beasts) appear not at Night.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\nI can scarcely find words to express the weary horrors of the long dark\\nmarch, during which the hapless traveller, fuming, if a European, with\\ndisappointment in his hopes of \\xef\\xbf\\xbdseeing the country,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n[p.68] is compelled to sit upon the back of a creeping camel. The\\nday-sleep, too, is a kind of lethargy, and it is all but impossible to\\npreserve an appetite during the hours of heat.\\n</p><p>At half-past five A.M., after drowsily stumbling through hours of outer\\ngloom, we entered a spacious basin at least six miles broad, and\\nlimited by a circlet of low hill. It was overgrown with camel-grass and\\nAcacia (Shittim) trees, mere vegetable mummies; in many places the\\nwater had left a mark; and here and there the ground was pitted with\\nmud-flakes, the remains of recently dried pools. After an hour\\xef\\xbf\\xbds rapid\\nmarch we toiled over a rugged ridge, composed of broken and detached\\nblocks of basalt and scori\\xef\\xbf\\xbd, fantastically piled together, and dotted\\nwith thorny trees. Shaykh Mas\\xef\\xbf\\xbdud passed the time in walking to and fro\\nalong his line of camels, addressing us with a Khallikum guddam, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdto the\\nfront (of the litter)!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd as we ascended, and a Khallikum wara, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdto the rear!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\nduring the descent. It was wonderful to see the animals stepping from\\nblock to block with the sagacity of mountaineers; assuring themselves\\nof their forefeet before trusting all their weight to advance. Not a\\ncamel fell, either here or on any other ridge: they moaned, however,\\npiteously, for the sudden turns of the path puzzled them; the ascents\\nwere painful, the descents were still more so; the rocks were sharp;\\ndeep holes yawned between the blocks, and occasionally an Acacia caught\\nthe Shugduf, almost overthrowing the hapless bearer by the suddenness\\nand the tenacity of its clutch. This passage took place during\\ndaylight. But we had many at night, which I shall neither forget nor\\ndescribe.\\n</p><p>Descending the ridge, we entered another hill-encircled basin of gravel\\nand clay. In many places basalt in piles and crumbling strata of\\nhornblende schiste, disposed edgeways, green within, and without\\nblackened by sun and rain, cropped out of the ground. At half-past ten\\nwe\\n</p><p>[p.69] found ourselves in an \\xef\\xbf\\xbdAcacia-barren,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd one of the things which\\npilgrims dread. Here Shugdufs are bodily pulled off the camel\\xef\\xbf\\xbds back and\\nbroken upon the hard ground; the animals drop upon their knees, the\\nwhole line is deranged, and every one, losing temper, attacks his\\nMoslem brother. The road was flanked on the left by an iron wall of\\nblack basalt. Noon brought us to another ridge, whence we descended\\ninto a second wooded basin surrounded by hills.\\n</p><p>Here the air was filled with those pillars of sand so graphically\\ndescribed by Abyssinian Bruce. They scudded on the wings of the\\nwhirlwind over the plain,\\xef\\xbf\\xbdhuge yellow shafts, with lofty heads,\\nhorizontally bent backwards, in the form of clouds; and on more than\\none occasion camels were thrown down by them. It required little\\nstretch of fancy to enter into the Arabs\\xef\\xbf\\xbd superstition. These\\nsand-columns are supposed to be Jinnis of the Waste, which cannot be\\ncaught, a notion arising from the fitful movements of the electrical\\nwind-eddy that raises them, and as they advance, the pious Moslem\\nstretches out his finger, exclaiming, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdIron! O thou ill-omened one[FN#15]!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n</p><p>During the forenoon we were troubled by the Samum, which, instead of\\npromoting perspiration, chokes up and hardens the skin. The Arabs\\ncomplain greatly of its violence on this line of road. Here I first\\nremarked the difficulty with which the Badawin bear thirst. Ya Latif,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\xef\\xbf\\xbdO\\nMerciful!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd (Lord),\\xef\\xbf\\xbdthey exclaimed at times; and yet they behaved like\\nmen.[FN#16] I had ordered them to place the\\n</p><p>[p.70] water-camel in front, so as to exercise due supervision. Shaykh\\nMas\\xef\\xbf\\xbdud and his son made only an occasional reference to the skins. But\\nhis nephew, a short, thin, pock-marked lad of eighteen, whose black\\nskin and woolly head suggested the idea of a semi-African and ignoble\\norigin, was always drinking; except when he climbed the camel\\xef\\xbf\\xbds back,\\nand, dozing upon the damp load, forgot his thirst. In vain we ordered,\\nwe taunted, and we abused him: he would drink, he would sleep, but he\\nwould not work.\\n</p><p>At one P.M. we crossed a Fiumara; and an hour afterwards we pursued the\\ncourse of a second. Mas\\xef\\xbf\\xbdud called this the Wady al-Khunak, and assured me\\nthat it runs from the East and the South-east in a North and North-west\\ndirection, to the Madinah plain. Early in the afternoon we reached a\\ndiminutive flat, on the Fiumara bank. Beyond it lies a Mahjar or stony\\nground, black as usual in Al-Hijaz, and over its length lay the road,\\nwhite with dust and with the sand deposited by the camels\\xef\\xbf\\xbd feet. Having\\narrived before the Pasha, we did not know where to pitch; many opining\\nthat the Caravan would traverse the Mahjar and halt beyond it. We soon\\nalighted, however, pitched the tent under a burning sun, and were\\nimitated by the rest of the party. Mas\\xef\\xbf\\xbdud called the place Hijriyah.\\nAccording to my computation, it is twenty-five miles from Ghurab, and\\nits direction is South-East twenty-two degrees.\\n</p><p>Late in the afternoon the boy Mohammed started with a dromedary to\\nprocure water from the higher part of the Fiumara. Here are some wells,\\nstill called Bir Harun, after the great Caliph. The youth returned soon\\nwith two bags filled at an expense of nine piastres. This being the\\n28th Zu\\xef\\xbf\\xbdl Ka\\xef\\xbf\\xbdadah, many pilgrims busied themselves\\n</p><p>[p.71] rather fruitlessly with endeavours to sight the crescent moon.\\nThey failed; but we were consoled by seeing through a gap in the\\nWestern hills a heavy cloud discharge its blessed load, and a cool\\nnight was the result.\\n</p><p>We loitered on Sunday, the 4th September, at Al-Hijriyah, although the\\nShaykh forewarned us of a long march. But there is a kind of discipline\\nin these great Caravans. A gun[FN#17] sounds the order to strike the\\ntents, and a second bids you move off with all speed. There are short\\nhalts, of half an hour each, at dawn, noon, the afternoon, and sunset,\\nfor devotional purposes, and these are regulated by a cannon or a\\nculverin. At such times the Syrian and Persian servants, who are\\nadmirably expert in their calling, pitch the large green tents, with\\ngilt crescents, for the dignitaries and their harims. The last\\nresting-place is known by the hurrying forward of these \\xef\\xbf\\xbdFarrash,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd or tent\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbdLascars,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd who are determined to be the first on the ground and at the\\nwell. A discharge of three guns denotes the station, and when the\\nCaravan moves by night a single cannon sounds three or four halts at\\nirregular intervals. The principal officers were the Emir Hajj, one\\nAshgar Ali Pasha, a veteran of whom my companions spoke slightingly,\\nbecause he had been the slave of a slave, probably the pipe-bearer of\\nsome grandee who in his youth had been pipe-bearer to some other\\ngrandee. Under him was a Wakil, or lieutenant, who managed the\\nexecutive. The Emir al-Surrah\\xef\\xbf\\xbdcalled simply Al-Surrah, or the Purse\\xef\\xbf\\xbdhad\\ncharge of the Caravan-treasure, and of remittances to the Holy Cities.\\nAnd lastly there was a commander of the\\n</p><p>[p.72] forces (Bashat al-Askar): his host consisted of about a thousand\\nIrregular horsemen, Bash-Buzuks, half bandits, half soldiers, each\\nhabited and armed after his own fashion, exceedingly dirty,\\npicturesque-looking, brave, and in such a country of no use whatever.\\n</p><p>Leaving Al-Hijriyah at seven A.M., we passed over the grim stone-field\\nby a detestable footpath, and at nine o\\xef\\xbf\\xbdclock struck into a broad\\nFiumara, which runs from the East towards the North-West. Its sandy bed\\nis overgrown with Acacia, the Senna plant, different species of\\nEuphorbiae, the wild Capparis, and the Daum Palm. Up this line we\\ntravelled the whole day. About six P.M., we came upon a basin at least\\ntwelve miles broad, which absorbs the water of the adjacent hills.\\nAccustomed as I have been to mirage, a long thin line of salt\\nefflorescence appearing at some distance on the plain below us, when\\nthe shades of evening invested the view, completely deceived me. Even\\nthe Arabs were divided in opinion, some thinking it was the effects of\\nthe rain which fell the day before: others were more acute. It is said\\nthat beasts are never deceived by the mirage, and this, as far as my\\nexperience goes, is correct. May not the reason be that most of them\\nknow the vicinity of water rather by smell than by sight? Upon the\\nhorizon beyond the plain rose dark, fort-like masses of rock which I\\nmistook for buildings, the more readily as the Shaykh had warned me\\nthat we were approaching a populous place. At last descending a long\\nsteep hill, we entered upon the level ground, and discovered our error\\nby the crunching sound of the camel[s\\xef\\xbf\\xbd] feet upon large curling flakes of\\nnitrous salt overlying caked mud.[FN#18] Those civilised birds, the\\nkite and the crow, warned us that we were in the vicinity of man. It\\nwas not, however, before eleven P.M. that we entered the confines of\\nAl-Suwayrkiyah. The fact was\\n</p><p>[p.73] made patent to us by the stumbling and the falling of our\\ndromedaries over the little ridges of dried clay disposed in squares\\nupon the fields. There were other obstacles, such as garden walls,\\nwells, and hovels, so that midnight had sped before our weary camels\\nreached the resting-place. A rumour that we were to halt here the next\\nday, made us think lightly of present troubles; it proved, however, to\\nbe false.\\n</p><p>During the last four days I attentively observed the general face of\\nthe country. This line is a succession of low plains and basins, here\\nquasi-circular, there irregularly oblong, surrounded by rolling hills\\nand cut by Fiumaras which pass through the higher ground. The basins\\nare divided by ridges and flats of basalt and greenstone averaging from\\none hundred to two hundred feet in height. The general form is a huge\\nprism; sometimes they are table-topped. From Al-Madinah to\\nAl-Suwayrkiyah the low beds of sandy Fiumaras abound. From\\nAl-Suwayrkiyah to Al-Zaribah, their place is taken by \\xef\\xbf\\xbdGhadir,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd or hollows\\nin which water stagnates. And beyond Al-Zaribah the traveller enters a\\nregion of water-courses tending West and South-West The versant is\\ngenerally from the East and South-East towards the West and North-West.\\nWater obtained by digging is good where rain is fresh in the Fiumaras;\\nsaltish, so as to taste at first unnaturally sweet, in the plains; and\\nbitter in the basins and lowlands where nitre effloresces and rain has\\nhad time to become tainted. The landward faces of the hills are\\ndisposed at a sloping angle, contrasting strongly with the\\nperpendicularity of their seaward sides, and I found no inner range\\ncorresponding with, and parallel to, the maritime chain. Nowhere had I\\nseen a land in which Earth\\xef\\xbf\\xbds anatomy lies so barren, or one richer in\\nvolcanic and primary formations.[FN#19] Especially\\n</p><p>[p.74] towards the South, the hills were abrupt and highly vertical,\\nwith black and barren flanks, ribbed with furrows and fissures, with\\nwide and formidable precipices and castellated summits like the work of\\nman. The predominant formation was basalt, called the Arabs\\xef\\xbf\\xbd Hajar\\nJahannam, or Hell-stone; here and there it is porous and cellular; in\\nsome places compact and black; and in others coarse and gritty, of a\\ntarry colour, and when fractured shining with bright points. Hornblende\\nis common at Al-Madinah and throughout this part of Al-Hijaz: it crops\\nout of the ground edgeways, black and brittle. Greenstone, diorite, and\\nactinolite are found, though not so abundantly as those above\\nmentioned. The granites, called in Arabic Suwan,[FN#20] abound. Some\\nare large-grained, of a pink colour, and appear in blocks, which,\\nflaking off under the influence of the atmosphere, form ooidal blocks\\nand boulders piled in irregular heaps. Others are grey and compact\\nenough to take a high polish when cut. The syenite is generally coarse,\\nalthough there is occasionally found a rich red variety of that stone.\\nI did not see eurite or euritic porphyry except in small pieces, and\\nthe same may be said of the petrosilex and the milky and waxy\\nquartz.[FN#21] In some parts, particularly between Yambu\\xef\\xbf\\xbd and Al-Madinah,\\nthere is an abundance of tawny\\n</p><p>[p.75] yellow gneiss markedly stratified. The transition formations are\\nrepresented by a fine calcareous sandstone of a bright ochre colour: it\\nis used at Meccah to adorn the exteriors of houses, bands of this stone\\nbeing here and there inserted into the courses of masonry. There is\\nalso a small admixture of the greenish sandstone which abounds at Aden.\\nThe secondary formation is represented by a fine limestone, in some\\nplaces almost fit for the purposes of lithography, and a coarse gypsum\\noften of a tufaceous nature. For the superficial accumulations of the\\ncountry, I may refer the reader to any description of the Desert\\nbetween Cairo and Suez.\\n</p><p>[FN#1] The distance from Baghdad to Al-Madinah is 180 parasangs,\\naccording to \\xef\\xbf\\xbdAbd al-Karim: \\xef\\xbf\\xbdVoyage de l\\xef\\xbf\\xbdInde, a la Mecque;\\xef\\xbf\\xbd translated by M.\\nLangles, Paris, 1797.

The Swiss traveller was\\nprevented by sickness from visiting it. The \\xef\\xbf\\xbdJazb al-Kulub\\xef\\xbf\\xbd affords the\\nfollowing account of a celebrated eruption, beginning on the Salkh\\n(last day) of Jamadi al-Awwal, and ending on the evening of the third\\nof Jamadi al-Akhir, A.H. 654. Terrible earthquakes, accompanied by a\\nthundering noise, shook the town; from fourteen to eighteen were\\nobserved each night. On the third of Jamadi al-Akhir, after the Isha\\nprayers, a fire burst out in the direction of Al-Hijaz (eastward); it\\nresembled a vast city with a turretted and battlemental fort, in which\\nmen appeared drawing the flame about, as it were, whilst it roared,\\nburned, and melted like a sea everything that came in its way.\\nPresently red and bluish streams, bursting from it, ran close to\\nAl-Madinah; and, at the same time, the city was fanned by a cooling\\nzephyr from the same direction. Al-Kistlani, an eye-witness, asserts\\nthat \\xef\\xbf\\xbdthe brilliant light of the volcano made the face of the country as\\nbright as day; and the interior of the Harim was as if the sun shone\\nupon it, so that men worked and required nought of the sun and moon\\n(the latter of which was also eclipsed?).\\xef\\xbf\\xbd Several saw the light at\\nMeccah, at Tayma (in Nijd, six days\\xef\\xbf\\xbd journey from Al-Madinah), and at\\nBusra, of Syria, reminding men of the Prophet\\xef\\xbf\\xbds saying, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdA fire shall burst\\nforth from the direction of Al-Hijaz; its light shall make visible the\\nnecks of the camels at Busra.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd Historians relate that the length of the\\nstream was four parasangs (from fourteen to sixteen miles), its breadth\\nfour miles (56? to the degree), and its depth about nine feet. It\\nflowed like a torrent with the waves of a sea; the rocks, melted by its\\nheat, stood up as a wall, and, for a time, it prevented the passage of\\nBadawin, who, coming from that direction, used to annoy the citizens.\\nJamal Matari, one of the historians of Al-Madinah, relates that the\\nflames, which destroyed the stones, spared the trees; and he asserts\\nthat some men, sent by the governor to inspect the fire, felt no heat;\\nalso that the feathers of an arrow shot into it were burned whilst the\\nshaft remained whole. This he attributes to the sanctity of the trees\\nwithin the Harim. On the contrary, Al-Kistlani asserts the fire to have\\nbeen so vehement that no one could approach within two arrow-flights,\\nand that it melted the outer half of a rock beyond the limits of the\\nsanctuary, leaving the inner parts unscathed. The Kazi, the Governor,\\nand the citizens engaged in devotional exercises, and during the whole\\nlength of the Thursday and the Friday nights, all, even the women and\\nchildren, with bare heads wept round the Prophet\\xef\\xbf\\xbds tomb. Then the lava\\ncurrent turned northwards. (I remarked on the way to Ohod signs of a\\nlava-field.) This current ran, according to some, three entire months.\\nAl-Kistlani dates its beginning on Friday, 6 Jamadi al-Akhir, and its\\ncessation on Sunday, 27 Rajab: in this period of fifty-two days he\\nincludes, it is supposed, the length of its extreme heat. That same\\nyear (A.H. 654) is infamous in Al-Islam for other portents, such as the\\ninundation of Baghdad by the Tigris, and the burning of the Prophet\\xef\\xbf\\xbds\\nMosque. In the next year first appeared the Tartars, who slew Al-Mu\\xef\\xbf\\xbdtasim\\nBi\\xef\\xbf\\xbdllah, the Caliph, massacred the Moslems during more than a month,\\ndestroyed their books, monuments, and tombs, and stabled their\\nwar-steeds in the Mustansariyah College.\\n[FN#4] In this part of Al-Hijaz they have many names for a pass:\\xef\\xbf\\xbdNakb,\\nSaghrah, and Mazik are those best known.\\n[FN#5] This is the palm, capped with large fan-shaped leaves, described\\nby every traveller in Egypt and in the nearer East.\\n[FN#6] The charge for a cup of coffee is one piastre and a half. A\\npipe-bearer will engage himself for about \\xef\\xbf\\xbd1 per mensem: he is always a\\nveteran smoker, and, in these regions, it is an axiom that the flavour\\nof your pipe mainly depends upon the filler. For convenience the\\nPersian Kaliun is generally used.\\n[FN#7] A day\\xef\\xbf\\xbds journey in Arabia is generally reckoned at twenty-four or\\ntwenty-five Arab miles. Abulfeda leaves the distance of a Marhalah (or\\nManzil, a station) undetermined. Al-Idrisi reckons it at thirty miles,\\nbut speaks of short as well as long marches. The common literary\\nmeasures of length are these:\\xef\\xbf\\xbd3 Kadam (man\\xef\\xbf\\xbds foot) = 1 Khatwah (pace): 1000\\npaces = 1 Mil (mile); 3 miles = 1 Farsakh (parasang); and 4 parasangs =\\n1 Barid or post. The \\xef\\xbf\\xbdBurhan i Katia\\xef\\xbf\\xbd gives the table thus:\\xef\\xbf\\xbd24 finger\\nbreadths (or 6 breadths of the clenched hand, from 20 to 24 inches!) =\\n1 Gaz or yard; 1000 yards = 1 mile; 3 miles = 1 parasang. Some call the\\nfour thousand yards measure a Kuroh (the Indian Cos), which, however,\\nis sometimes less by 1000 Gaz. The only ideas of distance known to the\\nBadawi of Al-Hijaz are the fanciful Sa\\xef\\xbf\\xbdat or hour, and the uncertain\\nManzil or halt: the former varies from 2 to 3\\xef\\xbf\\xbd miles, the latter from 15\\nto 25.\\n[FN#8] \\xef\\xbf\\xbdKhabt\\xef\\xbf\\xbd is a low plain; \\xef\\xbf\\xbdMidan,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd \\xef\\xbf\\xbdFayhah,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd or \\xef\\xbf\\xbdSath,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd a plain generally; and\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbdBatha,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd a low, sandy flat.\\n[FN#9] In Burckhardt\\xef\\xbf\\xbds day there were 5,000 souls and 15,000 camels.\\nCapt. Sadlier, who travelled during the war (1819), found the number\\nreduced to 500. The extent of this Caravan has been enormously\\nexaggerated in Europe. I have heard of 15,000, and even of 20,000 men.\\nI include in the 7,000 about 1,200 Persians. They are no longer placed,\\nas Abd al-Karim relates, in the rear of the Caravan, or post of danger.\\n[FN#10] Lane has accurately described this article: in the Hijaz it is\\nsometimes made to resemble a little tent.\\n[FN#11] The vehicle mainly regulates the expense, as it evidences a man\\xef\\xbf\\xbds\\nmeans. I have heard of a husband and wife leaving Alexandria with three\\nmonths\\xef\\xbf\\xbd provision and the sum of \\xef\\xbf\\xbd5. They would mount a camel, lodge in\\npublic buildings when possible, probably be reduced to beggary, and\\npossibly starve upon the road. On the other hand the minimum\\nexpenditure,\\xef\\xbf\\xbdfor necessaries, not donations and luxuries,\\xef\\xbf\\xbdof a man who\\nrides in a Takht-rawan from Damascus and back, would be about \\xef\\xbf\\xbd1,200.\\n[FN#12] On the line of march the Mahmil, stripped of its embroidered\\ncover, is carried on camel-back, a mere framewood. Even the gilt silver\\nballs and crescent are exchanged for similar articles in brass.\\n[FN#13] Mahattah is a spot where luggage is taken down, i.e., a\\nstation. By some Hijazis it is used in the sense of a halting-place,\\nwhere you spend an hour or two.\\n[FN#14] \\xef\\xbf\\xbdKhalik ma al-Badu\\xef\\xbf\\xbd is a favourite complimentary saying, among this\\npeople, and means that you are no greasy burgher.\\n[FN#15] Even Europeans, in popular parlance, call them \\xef\\xbf\\xbddevils.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n[FN#16] The Eastern Arabs allay the torments of thirst by a spoonful of\\nclarified butter, carried on journeys in a leathern bottle. Every\\nEuropean traveller has some recipe of his own. One chews a\\nmusket-bullet or a small stone. A second smears his legs with butter.\\nAnother eats a crust of dry bread, which exacerbates the torments, and\\nafterwards brings relief. A fourth throws water over his face and hands\\nor his legs and feet; a fifth smokes, and a sixth turns his dorsal\\nregion (raising his coat-tail) to the fire. I have always found that\\nthe only remedy is to be patient and not to talk. The more you drink,\\nthe more you require to drink\\xef\\xbf\\xbdwater or strong waters. But after the first\\ntwo hours\\xef\\xbf\\xbd abstinence you have mastered the overpowering feeling of\\nthirst, and then to refrain is easy.\\n[FN#17] We carried two small brass guns, which, on the line of march,\\nwere dismounted and placed upon camels. At the halt they were restored\\nto their carriages. The Badawin think much of these harmless articles,\\nto which I have seen a gunner apply a match thrice before he could\\ninduce a discharge. In a \\xef\\xbf\\xbdmoral\\xef\\xbf\\xbd point of view, therefore, they are far\\nmore valuable than our twelve-pounders.\\n[FN#18] Hereabouts the Arabs call these places \\xef\\xbf\\xbdBahr milh\\xef\\xbf\\xbd or \\xef\\xbf\\xbdSea of Salt\\xef\\xbf\\xbd; in\\nother regions \\xef\\xbf\\xbdBahr bila ma,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd or \\xef\\xbf\\xbdWaterless Sea.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n[FN#19] Being but little read in geology, I submitted, after my return\\nto Bombay, a few specimens collected on the way, to a learned friend,\\nDr. Carter, Secretary to the Bombay branch of the Royal Asiatic\\nSociety. His name is a guarantee of accuracy.\\n[FN#20] The Arabic language has a copious terminology for the mineral\\nas well as the botanical productions of the country: with little\\nalteration it might be made to express all the requirements of our\\nmodern geology.\\n[FN#21] NOTE TO THIRD EDITION.\\xef\\xbf\\xbdThis country may have contained gold; but\\nthe superficial formation has long been exhausted. At Cairo I washed\\nsome sand brought from the eastern shore of the Red Sea, north of\\nAl-Wijh, and found it worth my while.

[FN#2] The\\nMahrah, the Janabah, and the Gara especially show a low development,\\nfor which hardship and privation alone will not satisfactorily\\naccount.[FN#3] These are Arab al-Aribah for whose inferiority oriental\\nfable accounts as usual by thaumaturgy.\\n</p><p>The principal adven\\xef\\xbf\\xbd are the Noachians, a great Chaldaean or Mesopotamian\\ntribe which entered Arabia about\\n</p><p>[p.78] 2200 A.C., and by slow and gradual encroachments drove before\\nthem the ancient owners and seized the happier lands of the Peninsula.\\nThe great Anzah and the Nijdi families are types of this race, which is\\npurely Caucasian, and shows a highly nervous temperament, together with\\nthose signs of \\xef\\xbf\\xbdblood\\xef\\xbf\\xbd which distinguish even the lower animals, the horse\\nand the camel, the greyhound and the goat of Arabia. These advenae\\nwould correspond with the Arab al-Mutarribah or Arabicized Arabs of the\\neastern historians.[FN#4]\\n</p><p>The third family, an ancient and a noble race dating from A.C. 1900,\\nand typified in history by Ishmael, still occupies the so-called\\nSinaitic Peninsula. These Arabs, however, do not, and never did, extend\\nbeyond the limits of the mountains, where, still dwelling in the\\npresence of their brethren, they retain all the wild customs and the\\nuntamable spirit of their forefathers. They are distinguished from the\\npure stock by an admixture of Egyptian blood,[FN#5]\\n</p><p>[p.79] and by preserving the ancient characteristics of the Nilotic\\nfamily. The Ishmaelities are sub-Caucasian, and are denoted in history\\nas the Arab al-Mustarribah, the insititious or half-caste Arab.\\n</p><p>Oriental ethnography, which, like most Eastern sciences, luxuriates in\\nnomenclative distinction, recognises a fourth race under the name of\\nArab al-Mustajamah. These \\xef\\xbf\\xbdbarbarized Arabs\\xef\\xbf\\xbd are now represented by such a\\npopulation as that of Meccah.\\n</p><p>That Aus and Khazraj, the Himyaritic tribes which emigrated to\\nAl-Hijaz, mixed with the Amalikah, the Jurham, and the Katirah, also\\nraces from Al-Yaman, and with the Hebrews, a northern branch of the\\nSemitic family, we have ample historical evidence. And they who know\\nhow immutable is race in the Desert, will scarcely doubt that the\\nBadawi of Al-Hijaz preserves in purity the blood transmitted to him by\\nhis ancestors.[FN#6]\\n</p><p>[p.80] I will not apologise for entering into details concerning the\\npersonale of the Badawin[FN#7]; a precise physical portrait of race, it\\nhas justly been remarked, is the sole deficiency in the pages of Bruce\\nand of Burckhardt.\\n</p><p>The temperament of the Hijazi is not unfrequently the pure nervous, as\\nthe height of the forehead and the fine texture of the hair prove.\\nSometimes the bilious, and rarely the sanguine, elements predominate;\\nthe lymphatic I never saw. He has large nervous centres, and\\nwell-formed spine and brain, a conformation favourable to longevity.\\nBartema well describes his colour as a \\xef\\xbf\\xbddark leonine\\xef\\xbf\\xbd; it varies from the\\ndeepest Spanish to a chocolate hue, and its varieties are attributed by\\nthe people to blood. The skin is hard, dry, and soon wrinkled by\\nexposure. The xanthous complexion is rare, though not unknown in\\ncities, but the leucous does not exist. The crinal hair is frequently\\nlightened by bleaching, and the pilar is browner than the crinal. The\\nvoice is strong and clear, but rather barytone than bass: in anger it\\nbecomes a shrill chattering like the cry of a wild animal. The look of\\na chief is dignified and grave even to pensiveness; the \\xef\\xbf\\xbdrespectable man\\xef\\xbf\\xbds\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\nis self-sufficient and fierce; the lower orders look ferocious, stupid,\\nand inquisitive. Yet there is not much difference in this point between\\nmen of the same tribe, who have similar pursuits which engender\\n</p><p>[p.81] similar passions. Expression is the grand diversifier of\\nappearance among civilised people: in the Desert it knows few varieties.\\n</p><p>The Badawi cranium is small, ooidal, long, high, narrow, and remarkable\\nin the occiput for the development of Gall\\xef\\xbf\\xbds second propensity: the crown\\nslopes upwards towards the region of firmness, which is elevated;\\nwhilst the sides are flat to a fault. The hair, exposed to sun, wind,\\nand rain, acquires a coarseness not natural to it[FN#8]: worn in\\nKurun[FN#9]\\xef\\xbf\\xbdragged elf-locks,\\xef\\xbf\\xbdhanging down to the breast, or shaved in the\\nform Shushah, a skull-cap of hair, nothing can be wilder than its\\nappearance. The face is made to be a long oval, but want of flesh\\ndetracts from its regularity. The forehead is high, broad, and\\nretreating: the upper portion is moderately developed; but nothing can\\nbe finer than the lower brow, and the frontal sinuses stand out,\\nindicating bodily strength and activity of character. The temporal\\nfossa are deep, the bones are salient, and the elevated zygomata\\ncombined with the \\xef\\xbf\\xbdlantern-jaw,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd often give a \\xef\\xbf\\xbddeath\\xef\\xbf\\xbds-head\\xef\\xbf\\xbd appearance to the\\nface. The eyebrows are long, bushy, and crooked, broken, as it were, at\\nthe angle where \\xef\\xbf\\xbdOrder\\xef\\xbf\\xbd is supposed to be, and bent in sign of\\nthoughtfulness. Most popular writers, following De Page,[FN#10]\\ndescribe the Arab eye as large, ardent,\\n</p><p>[p.82] and black. The Badawi of the Hijaz, and indeed the race\\ngenerally, has a small eye, round, restless, deep-set, and fiery,\\ndenoting keen inspection with an ardent temperament and an impassioned\\ncharacter. Its colour is dark brown or green-brown, and the pupil is\\noften speckled. The habit of pursing up the skin below the orbits, and\\nhalf closing the lids to exclude glare, plants the outer angles with\\npremature crows\\xef\\xbf\\xbd-feet. Another peculiarity is the sudden way in which the\\neye opens, especially under excitement. This, combined with its fixity\\nof glance, forms an expression now of lively fierceness, then of\\nexceeding sternness; whilst the narrow space between the orbits\\nimpresses the countenance in repose with an intelligence not destitute\\nof cunning. As a general rule, however, the expression of the Badawi\\nface is rather dignity than that cunning for which the Semitic race is\\ncelebrated, and there are lines about the mouth in variance with the\\nstern or the fierce look of the brow. The ears are like those of Arab\\nhorses, small, well-cut, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdcastey,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd and elaborate, with many elevations and\\ndepressions. The nose is pronounced, generally aquiline, but sometimes\\nstraight like those Greek statues which have been treated as prodigious\\nexaggerations of the facial angle. For the most part, it is a well-made\\nfeature with delicate nostrils, below which the septum appears: in\\nanger they swell and open like a blood mare\\xef\\xbf\\xbds. I have, however, seen, in\\nnot a few instances, pert and offensive \\xef\\xbf\\xbdpugs.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd Deep furrows descend from\\nthe wings of the nose, showing an uncertain temper, now too grave, then\\ntoo gay. The mouth is irregular. The lips are either bordes, denoting\\nrudeness and want of taste, or they form a mere line. In the latter\\ncase there is an appearance of undue development in the upper portion\\nof the countenance, especially when the jaws are ascetically thin, and\\nthe chin weakly retreats. The latter\\n[p.83] feature, however, is generally well and strongly made. The\\nteeth, as usual among Orientals, are white, even, short and\\nbroad\\xef\\xbf\\xbdindications of strength. Some tribes trim their mustaches according\\nto the \\xef\\xbf\\xbdSunnat\\xef\\xbf\\xbd; the Shafe\\xef\\xbf\\xbdi often shave them, and many allow them to hang\\nPersian-like over the lips. The beard is represented by two tangled\\ntufts upon the chin; where whisker should be, the place is either bare\\nor is thinly covered with straggling pile.\\n</p><p>The Badawin of Al-Hijaz are short men, about the height of the Indians\\nnear Bombay, but weighing on an average a stone more. As usual in this\\nstage of society, stature varies little; you rarely see a giant, and\\nscarcely ever a dwarf. Deformity is checked by the Spartan restraint\\nupon population, and no weakly infant can live through a Badawi life.\\nThe figure, though spare, is square and well knit; fulness of limb\\nseldom appears but about spring, when milk abounds: I have seen two or\\nthree muscular figures, but never a fat man. The neck is sinewy, the\\nchest broad, the flank thin, and the stomach in-drawn; the legs, though\\nfleshless, are well made, especially when the knee and ankle are not\\nbowed by too early riding. The shins do not bend cucumber-like to the\\nfront as in the African race.[FN#11] The arms are thin, with muscles\\nlike whipcords, and the hands and feet are, in point of size and\\ndelicacy, a link between Europe and India. As in the Celt, the Arab\\nthumb is remarkably long, extending almost to the first joint of the\\nindex,[FN#12] which, with its easy rotation, makes it a perfect\\nprehensile instrument: the palm also is fleshless, small-boned, and\\n[p.84] elastic. With his small active figure, it is not strange that\\nthe wildest Badawi gait should be pleasing; he neither unfits himself\\nfor walking, nor distorts his ankles by turning out his toes according\\nto the farcical rule of fashion, and his shoulders are not dressed like\\na drill-sergeant\\xef\\xbf\\xbds, to throw all the weight of the body upon the heels.\\nYet there is no slouch in his walk; it is light and springy, and errs\\nonly in one point, sometimes becoming a strut.\\n</p><p>Such is the Badawi, and such he has been for ages. The national type\\nhas been preserved by systematic intermarriage. The wild men do not\\nrefuse their daughters to a stranger, but the son-in-law would be\\nforced to settle among them, and this life, which has its charms for a\\nwhile, ends in becoming wearisome. Here no evil results are anticipated\\nfrom the union of first cousins, and the experience of ages and of a\\nmighty nation may be trusted. Every Badawi has a right to marry his\\nfather\\xef\\xbf\\xbds brother\\xef\\xbf\\xbds daughter before she is given to a stranger; hence \\xef\\xbf\\xbdcousin\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n(Bint Amm) in polite phrase signifies a \\xef\\xbf\\xbdwife.[FN#13]\\xef\\xbf\\xbd Our\\nphysiologists[FN#14] adduce the Sangre Azul of Spain and the case of\\nthe lower animals to prove that degeneracy inevitably follows\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbdbreeding-in.[FN#15]\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n</p><p>[p.85] Either they have theorised from insufficient facts, or\\ncivilisation and artificial living exercise some peculiar influence, or\\nArabia is a solitary exception to a general rule. The fact which I have\\nmentioned is patent to every Eastern traveller.\\n</p><p>After this long description, the reader will perceive with pleasure\\nthat we are approaching an interesting theme, the first question of\\nmankind to the wanderer\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\xef\\xbf\\xbdWhat are the women like?\\xef\\xbf\\xbd Truth compels me to state\\nthat the women of the Hijazi Badawin are by no means comely. Although\\nthe Benu Amur boast of some pretty girls, yet they are far inferior to\\nthe high-bosomed beauties of Nijd. And I warn all men that if they run\\nto Al-Hijaz in search of the charming face which appears in my\\nsketch-book as \\xef\\xbf\\xbda Badawi girl,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd they will be bitterly disappointed: the\\ndress was Arab, but it was worn by a fairy of the West. The Hijazi\\nwoman\\xef\\xbf\\xbds eyes are fierce, her features harsh, and her face haggard; like\\nall people of the South, she soon fades, and in old age her appearance\\nis truly witch-like. Withered crones abound in the camps, where old men\\nare seldom seen. The sword and the sun are fatal to\\n</p><p>\\xef\\xbf\\xbdA green old age, unconscious of decay.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n</p><p>The manners of the Badawin are free and simple: \\xef\\xbf\\xbdvulgarity\\xef\\xbf\\xbd and\\naffectation, awkwardness and embarrassment, are weeds of civilised\\ngrowth, unknown to the People of the Desert.[FN#16] Yet their manners\\nare sometimes dashed with a strange ceremoniousness. When two frends\\nmeet, they either embrace or both extend the right hands, clapping palm\\nto palm; their foreheads are either pressed together, or their heads\\nare moved from side to side, whilst for minutes together mutual\\ninquiries are made and answered. It is a breach of decorum, even when\\neating, to turn the back upon a person, and if a Badawi\\n</p><p>[p.86] does it, he intends an insult. When a man prepares coffee, he\\ndrinks the first cup: the Sharbat Kajari of the Persians, and the\\nSulaymani of Egypt,[FN#17] render this precaution necessary. As a\\nfriend approaches the camp,\\xef\\xbf\\xbdit is not done to strangers for fear of\\nstartling them,\\xef\\xbf\\xbdthose who catch sight of him shout out his name, and\\ngallop up saluting with lances or firing matchlocks in the air. This is\\nthe well-known La\\xef\\xbf\\xbdab al-Barut, or gunpowder play. Badawin are generally\\npolite in language, but in anger temper is soon shown, and, although\\nlife be in peril, the foulest epithets\\xef\\xbf\\xbddog, drunkard, liar, and infidel\\xef\\xbf\\xbdare\\ndischarged like pistol-shots by both disputants.\\n</p><p>The best character of the Badawi is a truly noble compound of\\ndetermination, gentleness, and generosity. Usually they are a mixture\\nof worldly cunning and great simplicity, sensitive to touchiness,\\ngood-tempered souls, solemn and dignified withal, fond of a jest, yet\\nof a grave turn of mind, easily managed by a laugh and a soft word, and\\nplacable after passion, though madly revengeful after injury. It has\\nbeen sarcastically said of the Benu-Harb that there is not a man\\n</p><p>\\xef\\xbf\\xbdQue s\\xef\\xbf\\xbdil ne violoit, voloit, tuoit, bruloit\\nNe fut assez bonne personne.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n</p><p>The reader will inquire, like the critics of a certain modern\\nhumourist, how the fabric of society can be supported by such material.\\nIn the first place, it is a kind of societe leonine, in which the\\nfiercest, the strongest, and the craftiest obtains complete mastery\\nover his fellows, and this gives a\\n</p><p>[p.87] keystone to the arch. Secondly, there is the terrible\\nblood-feud, which even the most reckless fear for their posterity. And,\\nthirdly, though the revealed law of the Koran, being insufficient for\\nthe Desert, is openly disregarded, the immemorial customs of the Kazi\\nal-Arab (the Judge of the Arabs)[FN#18] form a system stringent in the\\nextreme.\\n</p><p>The valour of the Badawi is fitful and uncertain. Man is by nature an\\nanimal of prey, educated by the complicated relations of society, but\\nreadily relapsing into his old habits. Ravenous and sanguinary\\npropensities grow apace in the Desert, but for the same reason the\\nrecklessness of civilisation is unknown there. Savages and\\nsemi-barbarians are always cautious, because they have nothing valuable\\nbut their lives and limbs. The civilised man, on the contrary, has a\\nhundred wants or hopes or aims, without which existence has for him no\\ncharms. Arab ideas of bravery do not prepossess us. Their romances,\\nfull of foolhardy feats and impossible exploits, might charm for a\\ntime, but would not become the standard works of a really fighting\\npeople.[FN#19] Nor would a truly valorous race admire\\n</p><p>[p.88] the cautious freebooters who safely fire down upon Caravans from\\ntheir eyries. Arab wars, too, are a succession of skirmishes, in which\\nfive hundred men will retreat after losing a dozen of their number. In\\nthis partisan-fighting the first charge secures a victory, and the\\nvanquished fly till covered by the shades of night. Then come cries and\\ntaunts of women, deep oaths, wild poetry, excitement, and reprisals,\\nwhich will probably end in the flight of the former victor. When peace\\nis to be made, both parties count up their dead, and the usual\\nblood-money is paid for excess on either side. Generally, however, the\\nfeud endures till, all becoming weary of it, some great man, as the\\nSharif of Meccah, is called upon to settle the terms of a treaty, which\\nis nothing but an armistice. After a few months\\xef\\xbf\\xbd peace, a glance or a\\nword will draw blood, for these hates are old growths, and new\\ndissensions easily shoot up from them.\\n</p><p>But, contemptible though their battles be, the Badawin are not cowards.\\nThe habit of danger in raids and blood-feuds, the continual uncertainty\\nof existence, the desert, the chase, the hard life and exposure to the\\nair, blunting the nervous system; the presence and the practice of\\nweapons, horsemanship, sharpshooting, and martial exercises, habituate\\nthem to look death in the face like men, and powerful motives will make\\nthem heroes. The English, it is said, fight willingly for liberty, our\\nneighbours for glory; the Spaniard fights, or rather fought, for\\nreligion and the Pundonor; and the Irishman fights for the fun of\\nfighting. Gain and revenge draw the Arab\\xef\\xbf\\xbds sword; yet then he uses it\\nfitfully enough, without the gay gallantry of the\\n[p.89] French or the persistent stay of the Anglo-Saxon. To become\\ndesperate he must have the all-powerful stimulants of honour and of\\nfanaticism. Frenzied by the insults of his women, or by the fear of\\nbeing branded as a coward, he is capable of any mad deed.[FN#20] And\\nthe obstinacy produced by strong religious impressions gives a\\nsteadfastness to his spirit unknown to mere enthusiasm. The history of\\nthe Badawi tells this plainly. Some unobserving travellers, indeed,\\nhave mistaken his exceeding cautiousness for stark cowardice. The\\nincongruity is easily read by one who understands the principles of\\nBadawi warfare; with them, as amongst the Red Indians, one death dims a\\nvictory. And though reckless when their passions are thoroughly\\naroused, though heedless of danger when the voice of honour calls them,\\nthe Badawin will not sacrifice themselves for light motives. Besides,\\nthey have, as has been said, another and a potent incentive to\\ncautiousness. Whenever peace is concluded, they must pay for victory.\\n</p><p>There are two things which tend to soften the ferocity of Badawi life.\\nThese are, in the first place, intercourse with citizens, who\\nfrequently visit and entrust their children to the people of the Black\\ntents&#160;; and, secondly, the social position of the women.\\n</p><p>The Rev. Charles Robertson, author of a certain\\n</p><p>[p.90] \\xef\\xbf\\xbdLecture on Poetry, addressed to Working Men,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd asserts that Passion\\nbecame Love under the influence of Christianity, and that the idea of a\\nVirgin Mother spread over the sex a sanctity unknown to the poetry or\\nto the philosophy of Greece and Rome.[FN#21] Passing over the\\nobjections of deified Eros and Immortal Psyche, and of the Virgin\\nMother\\xef\\xbf\\xbdsymbol of moral purity\\xef\\xbf\\xbdbeing common to every old and material\\nfaith,[FN#22] I believe that all the noble tribes of savages display\\nthe principle. Thus we might expect to find, wherever the fancy, the\\nimagination, and the ideality are strong, some traces of a sentiment\\ninnate in the human organisation. It exists, says Mr. Catlin, amongst\\nthe North American Indians, and even the Gallas and the Somal of Africa\\nare not wholly destitute of it. But when the barbarian becomes a\\nsemi-barbarian, as are the most polished Orientals, or as were the\\nclassical authors of Greece and Rome, then women fall from their proper\\nplace in society, become mere articles of luxury, and sink into the\\nlowest moral condition. In the next stage, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdcivilisation,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd they rise again\\nto be \\xef\\xbf\\xbdhighly accomplished,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd and not a little frivolous.\\n</p><p>[p.91]Miss Martineau, when travelling through Egypt, once visited a\\nharim, and there found, among many things, especially in ignorance of\\nbooks and of book-making, materials for a heart-broken wail over the\\ndegradation of her sex. The learned lady indulges, too, in sundry\\nstrong and unsavoury comparisons between the harim and certain haunts\\nof vice in Europe. On the other hand, male travellers generally speak\\nlovingly of the harim. Sonnini, no admirer of Egypt, expatiates on \\xef\\xbf\\xbdthe\\ngenerous virtues, the examples of magnanimity and affectionate\\nattachment, the sentiments ardent, yet gentle, forming a delightful\\nunison with personal charms in the harims of the Mamluks.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n</p><p>As usual, the truth lies somewhere between the two extremes. Human\\nnature, all the world over, differs but in degree. Everywhere women may\\nbe \\xef\\xbf\\xbdcapricious, coy, and hard to please\\xef\\xbf\\xbd in common conjunctures: in the\\nhour of need they will display devoted heroism. Any chronicler of the\\nAfghan war will bear witness that warm hearts, noble sentiments, and an\\noverflowing kindness to the poor, the weak, and the unhappy are found\\neven in a harim. Europe now knows that the Moslem husband provides\\nseparate apartments and a distinct establishment for each of his wives,\\nunless, as sometimes happens, one be an old woman and the other a\\nchild. And, confessing that envy, hatred, and malice often flourish in\\npolygamy, the Moslem asks, Is monogamy open to no objections? As far as\\nmy limited observations go, polyandry is the only state of society in\\nwhich jealousy and quarrels about the sex are the exception and not the\\nrule of life.\\n</p><p>In quality of doctor I have seen a little and heard much of the harim.\\nIt often resembles a European home composed of a man, his wife, and his\\nmother. And I have seen in the West many a \\xef\\xbf\\xbdhappy fireside\\xef\\xbf\\xbd fitter to make\\nMiss Martineau\\xef\\xbf\\xbds heart ache than any harim in Grand Cairo.\\n</p><p>[p.92] Were it not evident that the spiritualising of sexuality by\\nsentiment, of propensity by imagination, is universal among the highest\\norders of mankind,\\xef\\xbf\\xbdc\\xef\\xbf\\xbdest l\\xef\\xbf\\xbdetoffe de la nature que l\\xef\\xbf\\xbdimagination a brodee, says\\nVoltaire,\\xef\\xbf\\xbdI should attribute the origin of \\xef\\xbf\\xbdlove\\xef\\xbf\\xbd to the influence of the\\nArabs\\xef\\xbf\\xbd poetry and chivalry upon European ideas rather than to mediaeval\\nChristianity. Certain \\xef\\xbf\\xbdFathers of the Church,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd it must be remembered, did\\nnot believe that women have souls. The Moslems never went so far.\\n</p><p>In nomad life, tribes often meet for a time, live together whilst\\npasturage lasts, and then separate perhaps for a generation. Under such\\ncircumstances, youths who hold with the Italian that\\n</p><p>\\xef\\xbf\\xbdPerduto e tutto il tempo\\nChe in amor non si spende,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n</p><p>will lose heart to maidens, whom possibly, by the laws of the clan,\\nthey may not marry,[FN#23] and the light o\\xef\\xbf\\xbd love will fly her home. The\\nfugitives must brave every danger, for revenge, at all times the Badawi\\xef\\xbf\\xbds\\nidol, now becomes the lodestar of his existence. But the Arab lover\\nwill dare all consequences. \\xef\\xbf\\xbdMen have died and the worms have eaten them,\\nbut not for love,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd may be true in the West: it is false in the East. This\\nis attested in every tale where love, and not ambition, is the\\ngroundwork of the narrative.[FN#24] And nothing can be more tender, more\\n</p><p>[p.93] pathetic than the use made of these separations and long\\nabsences by the old Arab poets. Whoever peruses the Suspended Poem of\\nLabid, will find thoughts at once so plaintive and so noble, that even\\nDr. Carlyle\\xef\\xbf\\xbds learned verse cannot wholly deface their charm.\\n</p><p>The warrior-bard returns from afar. He looks upon the traces of hearth\\nand home still furrowing the Desert ground. In bitterness of spirit he\\nchecks himself from calling aloud upon his lovers and his friends. He\\nmelts at the remembrance of their departure, and long indulges in the\\nabsorbing theme. Then he strengthens himself by the thought of Nawara\\xef\\xbf\\xbds\\ninconstancy, how she left him and never thought of him again. He\\nimpatiently dwells upon the charms of the places which detain her,\\nadvocates flight from the changing lover and the false friend, and, in\\nthe exultation with which he feels his swift dromedary start under him\\nupon her rapid course, he seems to seek and finds some consolation for\\nwomen\\xef\\xbf\\xbds perfidy and forgetfulness. Yet he cannot abandon Nawara\\xef\\xbf\\xbds name or\\nmemory. Again he dwells with yearning upon scenes of past felicity, and\\nhe boasts of his prowess\\xef\\xbf\\xbda fresh reproach to her,\\xef\\xbf\\xbdof his gentle birth, and\\nof his hospitality. He ends with an encomium upon his clan, to which he\\nattributes, as a noble Arab should, all the virtues of man. This is\\nGoldsmith\\xef\\xbf\\xbds deserted village in Al-Hijaz. But the Arab, with equal\\nsimplicity and pathos, has a fire, a force of language, and a depth of\\nfeeling, which the Irishman, admirable as his verse is, could never\\nrival.\\n</p><p>As the author of the Peninsular War well remarks, women in troubled\\ntimes, throwing off their accustomed feebleness and frivolity, become\\nhelpmates meet for man. The same is true of pastoral life. [FN#25]\\nHere, between the\\n</p><p><br />\\n[p.94] extremes of fierceness and sensibility, the weaker sex,\\nremedying its great want, power, rises itself by courage, physical as\\nwell as moral. In the early days of Al-Islam, if history be credible,\\nArabia had a race of heroines. Within the last century, Ghaliyah, the\\nwife of a Wahhabi chief, opposed Mohammed Ali himself in many a bloody\\nfield. A few years ago, when Ibn Asm, popularly called Ibn Rumi, chief\\nof the Zubayd clan about Rabigh, was treacherously slain by the Turkish\\ngeneral, Kurdi Osman, his sister, a fair young girl, determined to\\nrevenge him. She fixed upon the \\xef\\xbf\\xbdArafat-day\\xef\\xbf\\xbd of pilgrimage for the\\naccomplishment of her designs, disguised herself in male attire, drew\\nher kerchief in the form Lisam over the lower part of her face, and\\nwith lighted match awaited her enemy. The Turk, however, was not\\npresent, and the girl was arrested to win for herself a local\\nreputation equal to the \\xef\\xbf\\xbdmaid\\xef\\xbf\\xbd of Salamanca. Thus it is that the Arab has\\nlearned to swear that great oath \\xef\\xbf\\xbdby the honour of my women.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n</p><p>The Badawin are not without a certain Platonic affection, which they\\ncall Hawa (or Ishk) uzri\\xef\\xbf\\xbdpardonable love.[FN#26] They draw the fine line\\nbetween amant and amoureux: this is derided by the tow[n]speople,\\nlittle suspecting how much such a custom says in favour of the wild\\nmen.

This is true if \\xef\\xbf\\xbdpoet\\xef\\xbf\\xbd be limited to a few authors whose\\nexistence\\n</p><p>[p.98] everywhere depends upon the accidents of patronage or political\\noccurrences. A far stronger evidence of poetic feeling is afforded by\\nthe phraseology of the Arab, and the highly imaginative turn of his\\ncommonest expressions. Destitute of the poetic taste, as we define it,\\nhe certainly is: as in the Milesian, wit and fancy, vivacity and\\npassion, are too strong for reason and judgment, the reins which guide\\nApollo\\xef\\xbf\\xbds car.[FN#31] And although the Badawin no longer boast a Labid or\\na Maysunah, yet they are passionately fond of their ancient\\nbards.[FN#32] A man skilful in reading Al-Mutanabbi and the suspended\\nPoems would be received by them with the honours paid by civilisation\\nto the travelling millionaire.[FN#33] And their elders have a goodly\\nstore of ancient and modern war songs, legends, and love ditties which\\nall enjoy.\\n</p><p>[p.99]I cannot well explain the effect of Arab poetry to one who has\\nnot visited the Desert.[FN#34] Apart from the pomp of words, and the\\nmusic of the sound,[FN#35] there is a dreaminess of idea and a haze\\nthrown over the object, infinitely attractive, but indescribable.\\nDescription,\\n</p><p>[p.100] indeed, would rob the song of indistinctness, its essence. To\\nborrow a simile from a sister art; the Arab poet sets before the mental\\neye, the dim grand outlines of picture,\\xef\\xbf\\xbdwhich must be filled up by the\\nreader, guided only by a few glorious touches, powerfully standing out,\\nand by the sentiment which the scene is intended to express;\\xef\\xbf\\xbdwhereas, we\\nEuropeans and moderns, by stippling and minute touches, produce a\\nminiature on a large scale so objective as to exhaust rather than to\\narouse reflection. As the poet is a creator, the Arab\\xef\\xbf\\xbds is poetry, the\\nEuropean\\xef\\xbf\\xbds versical description. [FN#36] The language, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdlike a faithful\\nwife, following the mind and giving birth to its offspring,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd and free\\nfrom that \\xef\\xbf\\xbdluggage of particles\\xef\\xbf\\xbd which clogs our modern tongues, leaves a\\nmysterious vagueness between the relation of word to word, which\\nmaterially assists the sentiment, not the sense, of the poem. When\\nverbs and nouns have, each one, many different significations, only the\\nradical or general idea suggests itself.[FN#37] Rich and varied\\nsynonyms, illustrating the finest shades of meaning, are artfully used;\\nnow scattered to startle us by distinctness, now to form as it were a\\nstar about which dimly seen satellites revolve. And, to cut short a\\ndisquisition\\n</p><p>[p.101] which might be prolonged indefinitely, there is in the Semitic\\ndialect a copiousness of rhyme which leaves the poet almost unfettered\\nto choose the desired expression.[FN#38] Hence it is that a stranger\\nspeaking Arabic becomes poetical as naturally as he would be witty in\\nFrench and philosophic in German.

Detected twenty years ago,\\nthe delinquent would have been impaled; now he escapes with a\\nrib-roasting. Fear of the blood-feud, and the certainty of a shut road\\nto future travellers, prevent the Turks proceeding to extremes. They\\nconceal their weakness by pretending that\\n[p.102] the Sultan hesitates to wage a war of extermination with the\\nthieves of the Holy Land.\\n</p><p>It is easy to understand this respect for brigands. Whoso revolts\\nagainst society requires an iron mind in an iron body, and these\\nmankind instinctively admires, however misdirected be their energies.\\nThus, in all imaginative countries, the brigand is a hero; even the\\nassassin who shoots his victim from behind a hedge appeals to the fancy\\nin Tipperary or on the Abruzzian hills. Romance invests his loneliness\\nwith grandeur; if he have a wife or a friend\\xef\\xbf\\xbds wife, romance becomes\\ndoubly romantic, and a tithe of the superfluity robbed from the rich\\nand bestowed upon the poor will win to Gasparoni the hearts of a\\npeople. The true Badawi style of plundering, with its numerous niceties\\nof honour and gentlemanly manners, gives the robber a consciousness of\\nmoral rectitude. \\xef\\xbf\\xbdStrip off that coat, O certain person! and that turband,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\nexclaims the highwayman, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdthey are wanted by the daughter of my paternal\\nuncle (wife).\\xef\\xbf\\xbd You will (of course, if necessary) lend ready ear to an\\norder thus politely attributed to the wants of the fair sex. If you\\nwill add a few obliging expressions to the bundle, and offer Latro a\\ncup of coffee and a pipe, you will talk half your toilette back to your\\nown person; and if you can quote a little poetry, you will part the\\nbest of friends, leaving perhaps only a pair of sandals behind you. But\\nshould you hesitate, Latro, lamenting the painful necessity, touches up\\nyour back with the heel of his spear. If this hint suffice not, he will\\nmake things plain by the lance\\xef\\xbf\\xbds point, and when blood shows, the\\ntiger-part of humanity appears. Between Badawin, to be tamely\\nplundered, especially of the mare,[FN#39] is a lasting disgrace; a man\\nof\\n</p><p>[p.103] family lays down his life rather than yield even to\\noverpowering numbers. This desperation has raised the courage of the\\nBadawin to high repute amongst the settled Arabs, who talk of single\\nbraves capable, like the Homeric heroes, of overpowering three hundred\\nmen.\\n</p><p>I omit general details about the often-described Sar, or Vendetta. The\\nprice of blood is $800 = 200l., or rather that sum imperfectly\\nexpressed by live stock. All the Khamsah or A\\xef\\xbf\\xbdamam, blood relations of\\nthe slayer, assist to make up the required amount, rating each animal\\nat three or four times its proper value. On such occasions violent\\nscenes arise from the conflict of the Arab\\xef\\xbf\\xbds two pet passions, avarice\\nand revenge. The \\xef\\xbf\\xbdavenger of blood\\xef\\xbf\\xbd longs to cut the foe\\xef\\xbf\\xbds throat. On the\\nother hand, how let slip an opportunity of enriching himself? His\\ncovetousness is intense, as are all his passions. He has always a\\nproject of buying a new dromedary, or of investing capital in some\\nmarvellous colt; the consequence is, that he is insatiable. Still he\\nreceives blood-money with a feeling of shame; and if it be offered to\\nan old woman,\\xef\\xbf\\xbdthe most revengeful variety of our species, be it\\nremarked,\\xef\\xbf\\xbdshe will dash it to the ground and clutch her knife, and\\nfiercely swear by Allah that she will not \\xef\\xbf\\xbdeat\\xef\\xbf\\xbd her son\\xef\\xbf\\xbds blood.\\n</p><p>The Badawi considers himself a man only when mounted on horseback,\\nlance in hand, bound for a foray or a fray, and carolling some such\\ngaiety as\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n</p><p>\\xef\\xbf\\xbdA steede! a steede of matchlesse speede!\\nA sword of metal keene!\\nAll else to noble minds is drosse,\\nAll else on earth is meane.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n</p><p>Even in his sports he affects those that imitate war. Preserving the\\ninstinctive qualities which lie dormant in civilisation, he is an\\nadmirable sportsman. The children,\\n</p><p>[p.104] men in miniature, begin with a rude system of gymnastics when\\nthey can walk. \\xef\\xbf\\xbdMy young ones play upon the backs of camels,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd was the reply\\nmade to me by a Jahayni Badawi when offered some Egyptian plaything.\\nThe men pass their time principally in hawking, shooting, and riding.\\nThe \\xef\\xbf\\xbdSakr,[FN#40]\\xef\\xbf\\xbd I am told, is the only falcon in general use; they train\\nit to pursue the gazelle, which\\n</p><p>[p.105] greyhounds pull down when fatigued. I have heard much of their\\nexcellent marksmanship, but saw only moderate practice with a long\\nmatchlock rested and fired at standing objects. Double-barreled guns\\nare rare amongst them.[FN#41] Their principal weapons are matchlocks\\nand firelocks, pistols, javelins, spears, swords, and the dagger called\\nJambiyah; the sling and the bow have long been given up. The guns come\\nfrom Egypt, Syria, and Turkey; for the Badawi cannot make, although he\\ncan repair, this arm. He particularly values a good old barrel seven\\nspans long, and would rather keep it than his coat; consequently, a\\nfamily often boasts of four or five guns, which descend from generation\\nto generation. Their price varies from two to sixty dollars. The\\nBadawin collect nitre in the country, make excellent charcoal, and\\nimport sulphur from Egypt and India; their powder, however, is coarse\\nand weak. For hares and birds they cut up into slugs a bar of lead\\nhammered out to a convenient size, and they cast bullets in moulds.\\nThey are fond of ball-practice, firing, as every sensible man does, at\\nshort distances, and striving at extreme precision. They are ever\\nbacking themselves with wagers, and will shoot for a sheep, the loser\\ninviting his friends to a feast: on festivals they boil the head, and\\nuse it as mark and prize. Those who affect excellence are said to fire\\nat a bullet hanging by a thread; curious, however, to relate, the\\nBadawin of Al-Hijaz have but just learned the art, general in Persia\\nand Barbary, of shooting from horseback at speed.\\n</p><p>Pistols have been lately introduced into the Hijaz, and are not common\\namongst the Badawin. The citizens incline to this weapon, as it is\\nderived from Constantinople. In the Desert a tolerable pair with flint\\nlocks may be worth thirty dollars, ten times their price in England.\\n</p><p>[p.106]The spears[FN#42] called Kanat, or reeds, are made of male\\nbamboos imported from India. They are at least twelve feet long, iron\\nshod, with a tapering point, beneath which are one or two tufts of\\nblack ostrich feathers.[FN#43] Besides the Mirzak, or javelin, they\\nhave a spear called Shalfah, a bamboo or a palm stick garnished with a\\nhead about the breadth of a man\\xef\\xbf\\xbds hand.\\n</p><p>No good swords are fabricated in Al-Hijaz. The Khalawiyah and other\\nDesert clans have made some poor attempts at blades. They are brought\\nfrom Persia, India, and Egypt; but I never saw anything of value.\\n</p><p>The Darakah, or shield, also comes from India. It is the common Cutch\\narticle, supposed to be made of rhinoceros hide, and displaying as much\\nbrass knob and gold wash as possible. The Badawin still use in the\\nremoter parts Diraa, or coats of mail, worn by horsemen over buff\\njackets.\\n</p><p>The dagger is made in Al-Yaman and other places: it has a vast variety\\nof shapes, each of which, as usual, has its proper names. Generally\\nthey are but little curved (whereas the Gadaymi of Al-Yaman and\\nHazramaut is almost a semicircle), with tapering blade, wooden handle,\\nand scabbard of the same material overlaid with brass. At the point of\\nthe scabbard is a round knob, and the weapon is so long, that a man\\nwhen walking cannot swing his right\\n</p><p>[p.107] arm. In narrow places he must enter sideways. But it is the\\nmode always to appear in dagger, and the weapon, like the French\\nsoldier\\xef\\xbf\\xbds coupe-choux, is really useful for such bloodless purposes as\\ncutting wood and gathering grass. In price they vary from one to thirty\\ndollars.\\n</p><p>The Badawin boast greatly of sword-play; but it is apparently confined\\nto delivering a tremendous slash, and to jumping away from the\\nreturn-cut instead of parrying either with sword or shield. The\\ncitizens have learned the Turkish scimitar-play, which, in\\ngrotesqueness and general absurdity, rivals the East Indian school.\\nNone of these Orientals knows the use of the point which characterises\\nthe highest school of swordsmanship.\\n</p><p>The Hijazi Badawin have no game of chance, and dare not, I am told,\\nferment the juice of the Daum palm, as proximity to Aden has taught the\\nwild men of Al-Yaman.[FN#44] Their music is in a rude state. The\\nprincipal instrument is the Tabl, or kettle-drum, which is of two\\nkinds: one, the smaller, used at festivals; the other, a large copper\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbdtom-tom,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd for martial purposes, covered with leather, and played upon,\\npulpit-like, with fist, and not with stick. Besides which, they have\\nthe one-stringed Rubabah, or guitar, that \\xef\\xbf\\xbdmonotonous but charming\\ninstrument of the Desert.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd In another place I have described their\\ndancing, which is an ignoble spectacle.\\n</p><p>The Badawin of Al-Hijaz have all the knowledge necessary for procuring\\nand protecting the riches of savage life. They are perfect in the\\nbreeding, the training, and the selling of cattle. They know sufficient\\nof astronomy to guide themselves by night, and are acquainted\\n</p><p>[p.108] with the names of the principal stars. Their local memory is\\nwonderful. And such is their instinct in the art of asar, or tracking,\\nthat it is popularly said of the Zubayd clan, which lives between\\nMeccah and Al-Madinah, a man will lose a she-camel and know her\\nfour-year-old colt by its foot. Always engaged in rough exercises and\\nperilous journeys, they have learned a kind of farriery and a simple\\nsystem of surgery. In cases of fracture they bind on splints with cloth\\nbands, and the patient drinks camel\\xef\\xbf\\xbds milk and clarified butter till he\\nis cured. Cuts are carefully washed, sprinkled with meal gunpowder, and\\nsewn up. They dress gunshot wounds with raw camel\\xef\\xbf\\xbds flesh, and rely\\nentirely upon nature and diet. When bitten by snakes or stung by\\nscorpions, they scarify the wound with a razor, recite a charm, and\\napply to it a dressing of garlic.[FN#45] The wealthy have Fiss or\\nring-stones, brought from India, and used with a formula of prayer to\\nextract venom. Some few possess the Tariyak (Theriack) of Al-Irak\\xef\\xbf\\xbdthe\\ngreat counter-poison, internal as well as external, of the East. The\\npoorer classes all wear the Za\\xef\\xbf\\xbdal or Hibas of Al-Yaman; two yarns of\\nblack sheep\\xef\\xbf\\xbds wool tied round the leg, under the knee and above the\\nankle. When bitten, the sufferer tightens these cords above the injured\\npart, which he immediately scarifies; thus they act as tourniquets.\\nThese ligatures also cure cramps\\xef\\xbf\\xbdand there is no other remedy. The Badawi\\nknowledge of medicine is unusually limited in this part of Arabia,\\nwhere even simples are not required by a people who rise with dawn, eat\\nlittle, always breathe Desert air, and \\xef\\xbf\\xbdat night make the camels their\\ncurfew.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd The great tonic is clarified butter, and the Kay, or actual\\ncautery, is used even for rheumatism. This counter-irritant, together\\nwith a curious and artful phlebotomy,\\n</p><p>[p.109] blood being taken, as by the Italians, from the toes, the\\nfingers, and other parts of the body, are the Arab panaceas. They treat\\nscald-head with grease and sulphur. Ulcers, which here abound, without,\\nhowever, assuming the fearful type of the \\xef\\xbf\\xbdHelcoma Yemenense,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd are\\ncauterised and stimulated by verdigris. The evil of which Fracastorius\\nsang is combated by sudorifics, by unguents of oil and sulphur, and\\nespecially by the sand-bath. The patient, buried up to the neck,\\nremains in the sun fasting all day; in the evening he is allowed a\\nlittle food. This rude course of \\xef\\xbf\\xbdpacking\\xef\\xbf\\xbd lasts for about a month. It\\nsuits some constitutions; but others, especially Europeans, have tried\\nthe sand-bath and died of fever. Mules\\xef\\xbf\\xbd teeth, roasted and imperfectly\\npounded, remove cataract. Teeth are extracted by the farrier\\xef\\xbf\\xbds pincers,\\nand the worm which throughout the East is supposed to produce\\ntoothache, falls by fumigation. And, finally, after great fatigue, or\\nwhen suffering from cold, the body is copiously greased with clarified\\nbutter and exposed to a blazing fire.\\n</p><p>Mohammed and his followers conquered only the more civilised Badawin;\\nand there is even to this day little or no religion amongst the wild\\npeople, except those on the coast or in the vicinity of cities. The\\nfaith of the Badawi comes from Al-Islam, whose hold is weak. But his\\ncustoms and institutions, the growth of his climate, his nature, and\\nhis wants, are still those of his ancestors, cherished ere Meccah had\\nsent forth a Prophet, and likely to survive the day when every vestige\\nof the Ka\\xef\\xbf\\xbdabah shall have disappeared. Of this nature are the Hijazi\\xef\\xbf\\xbds\\npagan oaths, his heathenish names (few being Moslem except \\xef\\xbf\\xbdMohammed\\xef\\xbf\\xbd), his\\nordeal of licking red-hot iron, his Salkh, or scarification,\\xef\\xbf\\xbdproof of\\nmanliness,\\xef\\xbf\\xbdhis blood revenge, and his eating carrion (i.e., the body of\\nan animal killed without the usual formula), and his lending his wives\\nto strangers. All these I hold to be remnants of some old\\n</p><p>[p.110] creed; nor should I despair of finding among the Badawin\\nbordering upon the Great Desert some lingering system of idolatry.\\n</p><p>The Badawin of Al-Hijaz call themselves Shafe\\xef\\xbf\\xbdi but what is put into the\\nmouths of their brethren in the West applies equally well here. \\xef\\xbf\\xbdWe pray\\nnot, because we must drink the water of ablution; we give no alms,\\nbecause we ask them; we fast not the Ramazan month, because we starve\\nthroughout the year; and we do no pilgrimage, because the world is the\\nHouse of Allah.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd Their blunders in religious matters supply the citizens\\nwith many droll stories. And it is to be observed that they do not,\\nlike the Greek pirates or the Italian bandits, preserve a religious\\nelement in their plunderings; they make no vows, and they carefully\\navoid offerings.\\n</p><p>The ceremonies of Badawi life are few and simple\\xef\\xbf\\xbdcircumcisions,\\nmarriages, and funerals. Of the former rite there are two forms,\\nTaharah, as usual in Al-Islam, and Salkh, an Arab invention, derived\\nfrom the times of Paganism.[FN#46] During Wahhabi rule it was forbidden\\nunder pain of death, but now the people have returned to it. The usual\\nage for Taharah is between five and six; among\\n</p><p>[p.111] some classes, however, it is performed ten years later. On such\\noccasions feastings and merrymakings take place, as at our christenings.\\n</p><p>Women being a marketable commodity in barbarism as in civilisation, the\\nyouth in Al-Hijaz is not married till his father can afford to buy him\\na bride. There is little pomp or ceremony save firing of guns, dancing,\\nsinging, and eating mutton. The \\xef\\xbf\\xbdsettlement\\xef\\xbf\\xbd is usually about thirty sound\\nSpanish dollars,[FN#47] half paid down, and the other owed by the\\nbridegroom to the father, the brothers, or the kindred of his spouse.\\nSome tribes will take animals in lieu of ready money. A man of wrath\\nnot contented with his bride, puts her away at once. If peaceably\\ninclined, by a short delay he avoids scandal. Divorces are very\\nfrequent among Badawin, and if the settlement money be duly paid, no\\nevil comes of them.[FN#48]\\n</p><p>The funerals of the wild men resemble those of the citizens, only they\\nare more simple, the dead being buried where they die. The corpse,\\nafter ablution, is shrouded in any rags procurable; and, women and\\nhired weepers\\n</p><p>[p.112] not being permitted to attend, it is carried to the grave by\\nmen only. A hole is dug, according to Moslem custom; dry wood, which\\neverywhere abounds, is disposed to cover the corpse, and an oval of\\nstones surrounding a mound of earth keeps out jackals and denotes the\\nspot. These Badawin have not, like the wild Sindis and Baluchis,\\nfavourite cemeteries, to which they transport their dead from afar.\\n</p><p>The traveller will find no difficulty in living amongst the Hijazi\\nBadawin. \\xef\\xbf\\xbdTrust to their honour, and you are safe,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd as was said of the Crow\\nIndians; \\xef\\xbf\\xbdto their honesty and they will steal the hair off your head.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd But\\nthe wanderer must adopt the wild man\\xef\\xbf\\xbds motto, omnia mea mecum porto; he\\nmust have good nerves, be capable of fatigue and hardship, possess some\\nknowledge of drugs, shoot and ride well, speak Arabic and Turkish, know\\nthe customs by reading, and avoid offending against local prejudices,\\nby causing himself, for instance, to be called Taggaa. The payment of a\\nsmall sum secures to him a Rafik,[FN#49] and this \\xef\\xbf\\xbdfriend,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd after once\\nengaging in the task, will be faithful. \\xef\\xbf\\xbdWe have eaten salt together\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n(Nahnu Malihin) is still a bond of friendship: there are, however, some\\ntribes who require to renew the bond every twenty-four hours, as\\notherwise, to use their own phrase, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdthe salt is not in their stomachs.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\nCaution must be exercised in choosing a companion who has not too many\\nblood feuds. There is no objection to carrying a copper watch and a\\npocket compass, and a Koran could be fitted with secret pockets for\\nnotes and pencil. Strangers should especially avoid handsome weapons;\\nthese tempt the Badawin\\xef\\xbf\\xbds cupidity more than gold. The other extreme,\\ndefencelessness, is equally objectionable. It is needless to say that\\nthe traveller must never be seen writing anything but charms, and must\\non no account sketch in public. He should be careful in questioning,\\nand rather lead up\\n</p><p>[p.113] to information than ask directly. It offends some Badawin,\\nbesides denoting ignorance and curiosity, to be asked their names or\\nthose of their clans: a man may be living incognito, and the tribes\\ndistinguish themselves when they desire to do so by dress, personal\\nappearance, voice, dialect, and accentuation, points of difference\\nplain to the initiated. A few dollars suffice for the road, and if you\\nwould be \\xef\\xbf\\xbdrespectable,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd a taste which I will not deprecate, some such\\npresents as razors and Tarbushes are required for the chiefs.\\n</p><p>The government of the Arabs may be called almost an autonomy. The\\ntribes never obey their Shaykhs, unless for personal considerations,\\nand, as in a civilised army, there generally is some sharp-witted and\\nbrazen-faced individual whose voice is louder than the general\\xef\\xbf\\xbds. In\\ntheir leonine society the sword is the greater administrator of law.\\n</p><p>Relations between the Badawi tribes of Al-Hijaz are of a threefold\\ncharacter: they are either Ashab, Kiman, or Akhwan.\\n</p><p>Ashab, or \\xef\\xbf\\xbdcomrades,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd are those who are bound by oath to an alliance\\noffensive and defensive: they intermarry, and are therefore closely\\nconnected.\\n</p><p>Kiman,[FN#50] or foes, are tribes between whom a blood feud, the cause\\nand the effect of deadly enmity, exists.\\n</p><p>Akhawat, or \\xef\\xbf\\xbdbrotherhood,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd denotes the tie between the stranger and the\\nBadawi, who asserts an immemorial and inalienable right to the soil\\nupon which his forefathers fed their flocks. Trespass by a neighbour\\ninstantly causes war. Territorial increase is rarely attempted, for if\\nof a whole clan but a single boy escape he will one day assert his\\nclaim to the land, and be assisted by all the Ashab, or\\n[p.114] allies of the slain. By paying to man, woman, or child, a small\\nsum, varying, according to your means, from a few pence worth of\\ntrinkets to a couple of dollars, you share bread and salt with the\\ntribe, you and your horse become Dakhil (protected), and every one must\\nafford you brother-help. If traveller or trader attempt to pass through\\nthe land without paying Al-Akhawah or Al-Rifkah, as it is termed, he\\nmust expect to be plundered, and, resisting, to be slain: it is no\\ndishonour to pay it, and he clearly is in the wrong who refuses to\\nconform to custom. The Rafik, under different names, exists throughout\\nthis part of the world; at Sinai he was called a Ghafir, a Rabia in\\nEastern Arabia, amongst the Somal an Abban, and by the Gallas a Mogasa.\\nI have called the tax \\xef\\xbf\\xbdblack-mail\\xef\\xbf\\xbd; it deserves a better name, being\\nclearly the rudest form of those transit-dues and octrois which are in\\nnowise improved by \\xef\\xbf\\xbdprogress.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd The Ahl Bayt,[FN#51] or dwellers in the\\nBlack Tents, levy the tax from the Ahl Hayt, or the People of Walls;\\nthat is to say, townsmen and villagers who have forfeited right to be\\nheld Badawin. It is demanded from bastard Arabs, and from tribes who,\\nlike the Hutaym and the Khalawiyah, have been born basely or have\\nbecome \\xef\\xbf\\xbdnidering.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd And these people are obliged to pay it at home as well\\nas abroad. Then it becomes a sign of disgrace, and the pure clans, like\\nthe Benu Harb, will not give their damsels in marriage to \\xef\\xbf\\xbdbrothers.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n</p><p>Besides this Akhawat-tax and the pensions by the Porte to chiefs of\\nclans, the wealth of the Badawi consists in his flocks and herds, his\\nmare, and his weapons. Some clans are rich in horses; others are\\ncelebrated for camels; and not a few for sheep, asses, or greyhounds.\\nThe Ahamidah tribe, as has been mentioned, possesses few animals; it\\nsubsists by plunder and by presents from\\n</p><p>[p.115] pilgrims. The principal wants of the country are sulphur, lead,\\ncloths of all kinds, sugar, spices, coffee, corn, and rice. Arms are\\nvalued by the men, and it is advisable to carry a stock of Birmingham\\njewellery for the purpose of conciliating womankind. In exchange the\\nBadawin give sheep,[FN#52] cattle, clarified butter, milk, wool, and\\nhides, which they use for water-bags, as the Egyptians and other\\nEasterns do potteries. But as there is now a fair store of dollars in\\nthe country, it is rarely necessary to barter.\\n</p><p>The Arab\\xef\\xbf\\xbds dress marks his simplicity; it gives him a nationality, as,\\naccording to John Evelyn, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdprodigious breeches\\xef\\xbf\\xbd did to the Swiss. It is\\nremarkably picturesque, and with sorrow we see it now confined to the\\nwildest Badawin and a few Sharifs. To the practised eye, a Hijazi in\\nTarbush and Caftan is ridiculous as a Basque or a Catalonian girl in a\\ncachemire and a little chip. The necessary dress of a man is his Saub\\n(Tobe), a blue calico shirt, reaching from neck to ankles, tight or\\nloose-sleeved, opening at the chest in front, and rather narrow below;\\nso that the wearer, when running, must either hold it up or tuck it\\ninto his belt. The latter article, called Hakw, is a plaited leathern\\nthong, twisted round the waist very tightly, so as to support the back.\\nThe trousers and the Futah, or loin-cloth of cities, are looked upon as\\nsigns of effeminacy. In cold weather the chiefs wear over the shirt an\\nAba, or cloak. These garments are made in Nijd and the Eastern\\ndistricts; they are of four colours, white, black, red, and\\nbrown-striped. The best are of camels\\xef\\xbf\\xbd hair, and may cost fifteen\\ndollars; the worst, of sheep\\xef\\xbf\\xbds wool, are worth only three; both are\\ncheap, as they last for years. The Mahramah (head-cloth) comes from\\nSyria; which, with Nijd, supplies also the Kufiyah or headkerchief. The\\nUkal,[FN#53] fillets bound over\\n</p><p>[p.116] the kerchief, are of many kinds; the Bishr tribe near Meccah\\nmake a kind of crown like the gloria round a saint\\xef\\xbf\\xbds head, with bits of\\nwood, in which are set pieces of mother-o\\xef\\xbf\\xbd-pearl. Sandals, too, are of\\nevery description, from the simple sole of leather tied on with thongs,\\nto the handsome and elaborate chaussure of Meccah; the price varies\\nfrom a piastre to a dollar, and the very poor walk barefooted. A\\nleathern bandoleer, called Majdal, passed over the left shoulder, and\\nreaching to the right hip, supports a line of brass cylinders for\\ncartridges.[FN#54] The other cross-belt (Al-Masdar), made of leather\\nornamented with brass rings, hangs down at the left side, and carries a\\nKharizah, or hide-case for bullets. And finally, the Hizam, or\\nwaist-belt, holds the dagger and extra cartridge cases. A Badawi never\\nappears in public unarmed.\\n</p><p>Women wear, like their masters, dark blue cotton Tobes, but larger and\\nlooser. When abroad they cover the head with a Yashmak of black stuff,\\nor a poppy-coloured Burka (nose-gay) of the Egyptian shape. They wear\\nno pantaloons, and they rarely affect slippers or sandals. The hair is\\ntwisted into Majdul, little pig-tails, and copiously anointed with\\nclarified butter. The rich perfume the skin with rose and\\ncinnamon-scented oils, and adorn the hair with Al-Shayh (Absinthium),\\nsweetest herb of the Desert; their ornaments are bracelets, collars,\\near and nose-rings of gold, silver, or silver-gilt. The poorer classes\\nhave strings of silver coins hung round the neck.\\n</p><p>The true Badawi is an abstemious man, capable of living for six months\\non ten ounces of food per diem; the milk of a single camel, and a\\nhandful of dates, dry or fried in clarified butter, suffice for his\\nwants. He despises the obese and all who require regular and plentiful\\nmeals, sleeps on a mat, and knows neither luxury nor comfort, freezing\\nduring one quarter and frying for three quarters of the year. But\\nthough he can endure hunger, like all\\n</p><p>[p.117] savages, he will gorge when an opportunity offers. I never saw\\nthe man who could refrain from water upon the line of march; and in\\nthis point they contrast disadvantageously with the hardy Wahhabis of\\nthe East, and the rugged mountaineers of Jabal Shammar. They are still\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbdacridophagi,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd and even the citizens far prefer a dish of locusts to the\\nFasikh, which act as anchovies, sardines, and herrings in Egypt. They\\nlight a fire at night, and as the insects fall dead they quote this\\ncouplet to justify their being eaten\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n</p><p>\\xef\\xbf\\xbdWe are allowed two carrions and two bloods,\\nThe fish and locust, the liver and the spleen.[FN#55]\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n</p><p>Where they have no crops to lose, the people are thankful for a fall of\\nlocusts. In Al-Hijaz the flights are uncertain; during the last five\\nyears Al-Madinah has seen but few. They are prepared for eating by\\nboiling in salt water and drying four or five days in the sun: a \\xef\\xbf\\xbdwet\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\nlocust to an Arab is as a snail to a Briton. The head is plucked off,\\nthe stomach drawn, the wings and the prickly part of the legs are\\nplucked, and the insect is ready for the table. Locusts are never eaten\\nwith sweet things, which would be nauseous: the dish is always \\xef\\xbf\\xbdhot,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd with\\nsalt and pepper, or onions fried in clarified butter, when it tastes\\nnearly as well as a plate of stale shrimps.\\n</p><p>The favourite food on the line of march is meat cut into strips and\\nsun-dried. This, with a bag of milk-balls[FN#56]\\n</p><p>[p.118] and a little coffee, must suffice for journey or campaign. The\\nBadawin know neither fermented nor distilled liquors, although Ikhs ya\\xef\\xbf\\xbdl\\nKhammar! (Fie upon thee, drunkard!) is a popular phrase, preserving the\\nmemory of another state of things. Some clans, though not all, smoke\\ntobacco. It is generally the growth of the country called Hijazi or\\nKazimiyah; a green weed, very strong, with a foul smell, and costing\\nabout one piastre per pound. The Badawin do not relish Persian tobacco,\\nand cannot procure Latakia: it is probably the pungency of the native\\ngrowth offending the delicate organs of the Desert-men, that caused\\nnicotiana to be proscribed by the Wahhabis, who revived against its\\norigin a senseless and obsolete calumny.\\n</p><p>The almost absolute independence of the Arabs, and of that noble race\\nthe North American Indians of a former generation, has produced a\\nsimilarity between them worthy of note, because it may warn the\\nanthropologist not always to detect in coincidence of custom identity\\nof origin. Both have the same wild chivalry, the same fiery sense of\\nhonour, and the same boundless hospitality: elopements from tribe to\\ntribe, the blood feud, and the Vendetta are common to the to. Both are\\ngrave and cautious in demeanour, and formal in manner,\\xef\\xbf\\xbdprinces in rags or\\npaint. The Arabs plunder pilgrims; the Indians, bands of trappers; both\\nglory in forays, raids, and cattle-lifting; and both rob according to\\ncertain rules. Both are alternately brave to desperation, and shy of\\ndanger. Both are remarkable for nervous and powerful eloquence; dry\\nhumour, satire, whimsical tales, frequent tropes; boasts, and ruffling\\nstyle; pithy proverbs, extempore songs, and languages wondrous in their\\ncomplexity. Both, recognising no other occupation but war and the\\nchase, despise artificers and the effeminate people of cities, as the\\ngame-cock spurns the vulgar roosters of the poultry-yard.[FN#57] The\\n[p.119] chivalry of the Western wolds, like that of the Eastern wilds,\\nsalutes the visitor by a charge of cavalry, by discharging guns, and by\\nwheeling around him with shouts and yells. The \\xef\\xbf\\xbdbrave\\xef\\xbf\\xbd stamps a red hand\\nupon his mouth to show that he has drunk the blood of a foe. Of the\\nUtaybah \\xef\\xbf\\xbdHarami\\xef\\xbf\\xbd it is similarly related, that after mortal combat he\\ntastes the dead man\\xef\\xbf\\xbds gore.\\n</p><p>Of these two chivalrous races of barbarians, the Badawi claims our\\npreference on account of his treatment of women, his superior\\ndevelopment of intellect, and the glorious page of history which he has\\nfilled.\\n</p><p>The tribes of Al-Hijaz are tediously numerous: it will be sufficient to\\nenumerate the principal branches of the Badawi tree, without detailing\\nthe hundred little offshoots which it has put forth in the course of\\nages.[FN#58]\\n</p><p>Those ancient clans the Abs and Adnan have almost died out. The latter,\\nit is said, still exists in the neighbourhood of Taif; and the Abs, I\\nam informed, are to be found near Kusayr (Cosseir), on the African\\ncoast, but not in Al-Hijaz. Of the Aus, Khazraj, and Nazir details have\\nbeen given in a previous chapter. The Benu Harb is now the ruling clan\\nin the Holy Land.

The children of Ishmael, and his Egyptian wife; they peopled only\\nthe Wilderness of Paran in the Sinaitic Peninsula and the parts\\nadjacent. Dr. Aloys Sprenger (Life of Mohammed, p. 18), throws\\nphilosophic doubt upon the Ishmaelitish descent of Mohammed, who in\\npersonal appearance was a pure Caucasian, without any mingling of\\nEgyptian blood. And the Ishmaelitish origin of the whole Arab race is\\nan utterly untenable theory. Years ago, our great historian sensibly\\nremarked that \\xef\\xbf\\xbdthe name (Saracens), used by Ptolemy and Pliny in a more\\nconfined, by Ammianus and Procopius in a larger sense, has been derived\\nridiculously from Sarah the wife of Abraham.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd In Gibbon\\xef\\xbf\\xbds observation, the\\nerudite Interpreter of the One Primaeval Language,\\xef\\xbf\\xbdthe acute bibliologist\\nwho metamorphoses the quail of the wilderness into a \\xef\\xbf\\xbdruddy goose,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\xef\\xbf\\xbddetects\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbdinsidiousness\\xef\\xbf\\xbd and \\xef\\xbf\\xbda spirit of restless and rancorous hostility\\xef\\xbf\\xbd against\\nrevealed religion. He proceeds on these sound grounds to attack the\\naccuracy, the honesty and the learning of the mighty dead. This may be\\nChristian zeal; it is not Christian charity. Of late years it has been\\nthe fashion for every aspirant to ecclesiastical honours to deal a blow\\nat the ghost of Gibbon. And, as has before been remarked, Mr. Foster\\ngratuitously attacked Burckhardt, whose manes had long rested in the\\ngood-will of man. This contrasts offensively with Lord Lindsay\\xef\\xbf\\xbds happy\\ncompliment to the memory of the honest Swiss and the amiable eulogy\\nquoted by Dr. Keith from the Quarterly (vol. xxiii.), and thus adopted\\nas his own. It may seem folly to defend the historian of the Decline\\nand Fall against the compiler of the Historical Geography of Arabia.\\nBut continental Orientalists have expressed their wonder at the\\nappearance in this nineteenth century of the \\xef\\xbf\\xbdVoice of Israel from Mount\\nSinai\\xef\\xbf\\xbd and the \\xef\\xbf\\xbdIndia in Greece\\xef\\xbf\\xbd[;] they should be informed that all our\\nEastern students are not votaries of such obsolete vagaries.\\n[FN#2] This is said without any theory. According to all historians of\\nlong inhabited lands, the advenae\\xef\\xbf\\xbdwhether migratory tribes or visitors\\xef\\xbf\\xbdfind\\nindigens or [Greek].\\n[FN#3] They are described as having small heads, with low brows and\\nill-formed noses, (strongly contrasting with the Jewish feature),\\nirregular lines, black skins, and frames for the most part frail and\\nslender. For a physiological description of this race, I must refer my\\nreaders to the writings of Dr. Carter of Bombay, the medical officer of\\nthe Palinurus, when engaged on the Survey of Eastern Arabia. With ample\\nmeans of observation he has not failed to remark the similarity between\\nthe lowest type of Badawi and the Indigens of India, as represented by\\nthe Bhils and other Jungle races. This, from a man of science who is\\nnot writing up to a theory, may be considered strong evidence in favour\\nof variety in the Arabian family. The fact has long been suspected, but\\nfew travellers have given their attention to the subject since the\\ndownfall of Sir William Jones\\xef\\xbf\\xbd Indian origin theory. I am convinced that\\nthere is not in Arabia \\xef\\xbf\\xbdone Arab face, cast of features and expression,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd as\\nwas formerly supposed to be the case, and I venture to recommend the\\nsubject for consideration to future observers.\\n[FN#4] Of this Mesopotamian race there are now many local varieties.\\nThe subjects of the four Abyssinian and Christian sovereigns who\\nsucceeded Yusuf, the Jewish \\xef\\xbf\\xbdLord of the Pit,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd produced, in Al-Yaman, the\\nmodern \\xef\\xbf\\xbdAkhdam\\xef\\xbf\\xbd or \\xef\\xbf\\xbdServiles.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd The \\xef\\xbf\\xbdHujur\\xef\\xbf\\xbd of Al-Yaman and Oman are a mixed race\\nwhose origin is still unknown. And to quote no more cases, the \\xef\\xbf\\xbdEbna\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\nmentioned by the Ibn Ishak were descended from the Persian soldiers of\\nAnushirwan, who expelled the Abyssinian invader.\\n[FN#5] That the Copts, or ancient Egyptians, were \\xef\\xbf\\xbdHalf-caste Arabs,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd a\\nmixed people like the Abyssinians, the Gallas, the Somal, and the\\nKafirs, an Arab graft upon an African stock, appears highly probable.\\nHence the old Nilotic race has been represented as woolly-headed and of\\nnegro feature. Thus Leo Africanus makes the Africans to be descendants\\nof the Arabs. Hence the tradition that Egypt was peopled by AEthiopia,\\nand has been gradually whitened by admixture of Persian and Median,\\nGreek and Roman blood. Hence, too, the fancied connection of Aethiopia\\nwith Cush, Susiana, Khuzistan or the lands about the Tigris. Thus\\nlearned Virgil, confounding the Western with the Eastern Aethiopians,\\nalludes to\\n</p><p>\\xef\\xbf\\xbdUsque coloratos Nilus devexus ad Indos.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n</p><p>And Strabo maintains the people of Mauritania to be Indians who had\\ncome with Hercules. We cannot but remark in Southern Arabia the\\nfootprints of the Hindu, whose superstitions, like the Phoenix which\\nflew from India to expire in Egypt, passed over to Arabia with Dwipa\\nSukhatra (Socotra) for a resting place on its way to the regions of the\\nremotest West. As regards the difference between the Japhetic and\\nSemitic tongues, it may be remarked that though nothing can be more\\ndistinct than Sanscrit and Arabic, yet that Pahlavi and Hebrew (Prof.\\nBohlen on Genesis) present some remarkable points of resemblance. I\\nhave attempted in a work on Sind to collect words common to both\\nfamilies. And further research convinces me that such vocables as the\\nArabic Taur [Arabic] the Persian Tora [Persian] and the Latin \\xef\\xbf\\xbdTaurus\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\ndenote an ancient rapprochement, whose mysteries still invite the\\nelucidation of modern science.\\n[FN#6] The Sharif families affect marrying female slaves, thereby\\nshowing the intense pride which finds no Arab noble enough for them.\\nOthers take to wife Badawi girls: their blood, therefore, is by no\\nmeans pure. The worst feature of their system is the forced celibacy of\\ntheir daughters; they are never married into any but Sharif families;\\nconsequently they often die in spinsterhood. The effects of this custom\\nare most pernicious, for though celibacy exists in the East it is by no\\nmeans synonymous with chastity. Here it springs from a morbid sense of\\nhonour, and arose, it is popularly said, from an affront taken by a\\nSharif against his daughter\\xef\\xbf\\xbds husband. But all Arabs condemn the practice.\\n[FN#7] I use this word as popular abuse has fixed it. Every Orientalist\\nknows that Badawin (Bedouin) is the plural form of Badawi, an \\xef\\xbf\\xbdism\\nal-nisbah,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd or adjective derived from Badu, a Desert. \\xef\\xbf\\xbdSome words\\nnotoriously corrupt,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd says Gibbon, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdare fixed, and as it were naturalised,\\nin the vulgar tongue.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd The word \\xef\\xbf\\xbdBadawi\\xef\\xbf\\xbd is not insulting, like \\xef\\xbf\\xbdTurk\\xef\\xbf\\xbd applied to\\nan Osmanli, or \\xef\\xbf\\xbdFellah\\xef\\xbf\\xbd to the Egyptian. But you affront the wild man by\\nmistaking his clan for a lower one. \\xef\\xbf\\xbdYa Hitaymi,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd for instance, addressed\\nto a Harb Badawi, makes him finger his dagger.\\n[FN#8] This coarseness is not a little increased by a truly Badawi\\nhabit of washing the locks with\\xef\\xbf\\xbd[Arabic]. It is not considered wholly\\nimpure, and is also used for the eyes, upon which its ammonia would act\\nas a rude stimulant. The only cosmetic is clarified butter freely\\napplied to the body as well as to the hair.\\n[FN#9] \\xef\\xbf\\xbdKurun\\xef\\xbf\\xbd ([Arabic]) properly means \\xef\\xbf\\xbdhorns.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd The Sharifs generally wear\\ntheir hair in \\xef\\xbf\\xbdHaffah\\xef\\xbf\\xbd ([Arabic]), long locks hanging down both sides of\\nthe neck and shaved away about a finger\\xef\\xbf\\xbds breadth round the forehead and\\nbehind the neck.\\n[FN#10] This traveller describes the modern Mesopotamian and Northern\\nrace, which, as its bushy beard\\xef\\xbf\\xbdunusual feature in pure Arab blood\\xef\\xbf\\xbddenotes,\\nis mixed with central Asian. In the North, as might be expected, the\\ncamels are hairy; whereas, in Al-Hijaz and in the low parts of\\nAl-Yaman, a whole animal does not give a handful fit for weaving. The\\nArabs attribute this, as we should, to heat, which causes the longer\\nhairs to drop off.\\n[FN#11] \\xef\\xbf\\xbdMagnum inter Arabes et Africanos discrimen efficit [Greek].\\nArabum parvula membra sicut nobilis aequi. Africanum tamen flaccum,\\ncrassum longumque: ita quiescens, erectum tamen parum distenditur.\\nArgumentum validissimum est ad indagandam Egyptorum originem: Nilotica\\nenim gens membrum habet Africanum.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n[FN#12] Whereas the Saxon thumb is thick, flat, and short, extending\\nscarcely half way to the middle joint of the index.\\n[FN#13] A similar unwillingness to name the wife may be found in some\\nparts of southern Europe, where probably jealousy or possibly Asiatic\\ncustom has given rise to it. Among the Maltese it appears in a truly\\nridiculous way, e.g., \\xef\\xbf\\xbddice la mia moglie, con rispetto parlando, &amp;c.,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\nsays the husband, adding to the word spouse a \\xef\\xbf\\xbdsaving your presence,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd as if\\nhe were speaking of something offensive.\\n[FN#14] Dr. Howe (Report on Idiotcy in Massachusetts, 1848,) asserts\\nthat \\xef\\xbf\\xbdthe law against the marriage of relations is made out as clearly as\\nthough it were written on tables of stone.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd He proceeds to show that in\\nseventeen households where the parents were connected by blood, of\\nninety-five children one was a dwarf, one deaf, twelve scrofulous, and\\nforty-four idiots\\xef\\xbf\\xbdtotal fifty-eight diseased!\\n[FN#15] Yet the celebrated \\xef\\xbf\\xbdFlying Childers\\xef\\xbf\\xbd and all his race were\\nremarkably bred in. There is still, in my humble opinion, much mystery\\nabout the subject, to be cleared up only by the studies of\\nphysiologists.\\n[FN#16] This sounds in English like an \\xef\\xbf\\xbdIrish bull.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd I translate \\xef\\xbf\\xbdBadu,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd as the\\ndictionaries do, \\xef\\xbf\\xbda Desert.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n[FN#17] The Sharbat Kajari is the \\xef\\xbf\\xbdAcquetta\\xef\\xbf\\xbd of Persia, and derives its\\nname from the present royal family. It is said to be a mixture of\\nverdigris with milk; if so, it is a very clumsy engine of state policy.\\nIn Egypt and Mosul, Sulaymani (the common name for an Afghan) is used\\nto signify \\xef\\xbf\\xbdpoison\\xef\\xbf\\xbd; but I know not whether it be merely euphuistic or\\nconfined to some species. The banks of the Nile are infamous for these\\narts, and Mohammed Ali Pasha imported, it is said, professional\\npoisoners from Europe.\\n[FN#18] Throughout the world the strictness of the Lex Scripta is in\\ninverse ratio to that of custom: whenever the former is lax, the latter\\nis stringent, and vice versa. Thus in England, where law leaves men\\ncomparatively free, they are slaves to a grinding despotism of\\nconventionalities, unknown in the land of tyrannical rule. This\\nexplains why many men, accustomed to live under despotic governments,\\nfeel fettered and enslaved in the so-called free countries. Hence,\\nalso, the reason why notably in a republic there is less private and\\npractical liberty than under a despotism. The \\xef\\xbf\\xbdKazi al-Arab\\xef\\xbf\\xbd (Judge of the\\nArabs) is in distinction to the Kazi al-Shara, or the Kazi of the\\nKoran. The former is, almost always, some sharp-witted greybeard, with\\na minute knowledge of genealogy and precedents, a retentive memory and\\nan eloquent tongue.\\n[FN#19] Thus the Arabs, being decidedly a parsimonious people, indulge\\nin exaggerated praises and instances of liberality. Hatim Tai, whose\\ngenerosity is unintelligible to Europeans, becomes the Arab model of\\nthe \\xef\\xbf\\xbdopen hand.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd Generally a high beau ideal is no proof of a people\\xef\\xbf\\xbds\\npractical pre-eminence, and when exaggeration enters into it and suits\\nthe public taste, a low standard of actuality may be fairly suspected.\\nBut to convince the oriental mind you must dazzle it. Hence, in part,\\nthe superhuman courage of Antar, the liberality of Hatim, the justice\\nof Omar, and the purity of Laila and Majnun under circumstances more\\ntrying than aught chronicled in Mathilde, or in the newest American\\nnovel.\\n[FN#20] At the battle of Bissel, when Mohammed Ali of Egypt broke the\\n40,000 guerillas of Faisal son of Sa\\xef\\xbf\\xbdud the Wahhabi, whole lines of the\\nBenu Asir tribe were found dead and tied by the legs with ropes. This\\nsystem of colligation dates from old times in Arabia, as the \\xef\\xbf\\xbdAffair of\\nChains\\xef\\xbf\\xbd (Zat al-Salasil) proves. It is alluded to by the late Sir Henry\\nElliot in his \\xef\\xbf\\xbdAppendix to the Arabs in Sind,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\xef\\xbf\\xbda work of remarkable sagacity\\nand research. According to the \\xef\\xbf\\xbdBeglar-Nameh,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd it was a \\xef\\xbf\\xbdcustom of the people\\nof Hind and Sind, whenever they devote themselves to death, to bind\\nthemselves to each other by their mantles and waistbands.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd It seems to\\nhave been an ancient practice in the West as in the East: the Cimbri,\\nto quote no other instances, were tied together with cords when\\nattacked by Marius. Tactic truly worthy of savages to prepare for\\nvictory by expecting a defeat!\\n[FN#21] Though differing in opinion, upon one subject, from the Rev.\\nMr. Robertson, the lamented author of this little work, I cannot\\nrefrain from expressing the highest admiration of those noble thoughts,\\nthose exalted views, and those polished sentiments which, combining the\\ndelicacy of the present with the chivalry of a past age, appear in a\\nstyle\\n</p><p>\\xef\\xbf\\xbdAs smooth as woman and as strong as man.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n</p><p>Would that it were in my power to pay a more adequate tribute to his\\nmemory!\\n[FN#22] Even Juno, in the most meaningless of idolatries, became,\\naccording to Pausanias (lib. ii. cap. 38), a virgin once every year.\\nAnd be it observed that Al-Islam (the faith, not the practice)\\npopularly decided to debase the social state of womankind, exalts it by\\nholding up to view no fewer than two examples of perfection in the\\nProphet\\xef\\xbf\\xbds household. Khadijah, his first wife, was a minor saint, and the\\nLady Fatimah is supposed to have been spiritually unspotted by sin, and\\nmaterially ever a virgin, even after giving birth to Hasan and to\\nHosayn.\\n[FN#23] There is no objection to intermarriage between equal clans, but\\nthe higher will not give their daughters to the lower in dignity.\\n[FN#24] For instance: \\xef\\xbf\\xbdA certain religious man was so deeply affected\\nwith the love of a king\\xef\\xbf\\xbds daughter, that he was brought to the brink of\\nthe grave,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd is a favourite inscriptive formula. Usually the hero \\xef\\xbf\\xbdsickens\\nin consequence of the heroine\\xef\\xbf\\xbds absence, and continues to the hour of his\\ndeath in the utmost grief and anxiety.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd He rarely kills himself, but\\nsometimes, when in love with a pretty infidel, he drinks wine and he\\nburns the Koran. The \\xef\\xbf\\xbdhated rival\\xef\\xbf\\xbd is not a formidable person; but there\\nare for good reasons great jealousy of female friends, and not a little\\nfear of the beloved\\xef\\xbf\\xbds kinsmen. Such are the material sentiments; the\\nspiritual part is a thread of mysticism, upon which all the pearls of\\nadventure and incident are strung.\\n[FN#25] It is curious that these pastoral races, which supply poetry\\nwith namby-pamby Colinades, figure as the great tragedians of history.\\nThe Scythians, the Huns, the Arabs, and the Tartars were all shepherds.\\nThey first armed themselves with clubs to defend their flocks from wild\\nbeasts. Then they learned warfare, and improved means of destruction by\\npetty quarrels about pastures; and, finally, united by the commanding\\ngenius of some skin-clad Caesar or Napoleon, they fell like avalanches\\nupon those valleys of the world\\xef\\xbf\\xbdMesopotamia, India, and Egypt\\xef\\xbf\\xbdwhose\\nenervate races offered them at once temptations to attack, and\\ncertainty of success.\\n[FN#26] Even amongst the Indians, as a race the least chivalrous of\\nmen, there is an oath which binds two persons of different sex in the\\ntie of friendship, by making them brother and sister to each other.\\n[FN#27] Richardson derives our \\xef\\xbf\\xbdknight\\xef\\xbf\\xbd from Nikht ([Arabic]), a tilter\\nwith spears, and \\xef\\xbf\\xbdCaitiff\\xef\\xbf\\xbd from Khattaf, ([Arabic]) a snatcher or ravisher.\\n[FN#28] I am not ignorant that the greater part of \\xef\\xbf\\xbdAntar\\xef\\xbf\\xbd is of modern and\\ndisputed origin. Still it accurately expresses Arab sentiment.\\n[FN#29] I wish that the clever Orientalist who writes in the Saturday\\nReview would not translate \\xef\\xbf\\xbdAl-Layl,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd by lenes sub nocte susurri: the Arab\\nbard alluded to no such effeminacies.\\n[FN#30] The subject of \\xef\\xbf\\xbdDakhl\\xef\\xbf\\xbd has been thoroughly exhausted by Burckhardt\\nand Layard. It only remains to be said that the Turks, through\\nignorance of the custom, have in some cases made themselves\\ncontemptible by claiming the protection of women.\\n[FN#31] It is by no means intended to push this comparison of the Arab\\xef\\xbf\\xbds\\nwith the Hibernian\\xef\\xbf\\xbds poetry. The former has an intensity which prevents\\nour feeling that \\xef\\xbf\\xbdthere are too many flowers for the fruit\\xef\\xbf\\xbd; the latter is\\ntoo often a mere blaze of words, which dazzle and startle, but which,\\ndecomposed by reflection, are found to mean nothing.

The traveller in Arabia will always be told that some\\nremote clan still produces mighty bards, and uses in conversation the\\nterminal vowels of the classic tongue, but he will not believe these\\nassertions till personally convinced of their truth. The Badawi\\ndialect, however, though debased, is still, as of yore, purer than the\\nlanguage of the citizens. During the days when philology was a passion\\nin the East, those Stephens and Johnsons of Semitic lore, Firuzabadi\\nand Al-Zamakhshari, wandered from tribe to tribe and from tent to tent,\\ncollecting words and elucidating disputed significations. Their\\ngrammatical expeditions are still remembered, and are favourite stories\\nwith scholars.\\n[FN#33] I say \\xef\\xbf\\xbdskilful in reading,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd because the Arabs, like the Spaniards,\\nhate to hear their language mangled by mispronunciation. When\\nBurckhardt, who spoke badly, began to read verse to the Badawin, they\\ncould not refrain from a movement of impatience, and used to snatch the\\nbook out of his hands.\\n[FN#34] The civilized poets of the Arab cities throw the charm of the\\nDesert over their verse, by images borrowed from its scenery\\xef\\xbf\\xbdthe\\ndromedary, the mirage, and the well\\xef\\xbf\\xbdas naturally as certain of our\\nsongsters, confessedly haters of the country, babble of lowing kine,\\nshady groves, spring showers, and purling rills.\\n[FN#35] Some will object to this expression; Arabic being a harsh and\\nguttural tongue. But the sound of language, in the first place, depends\\nchiefly upon the articulator. Who thinks German rough in the mouth of a\\nwoman, with a suspicion of a lisp, or that English is the dialect of\\nbirds, when spoken by an Italian? Secondly, there is a music far more\\nspirit-stirring in harshness than in softness: the languages of Castile\\nand of Tuscany are equally beautiful, yet who does not prefer the sound\\nof the former? The gutturality of Arabia is less offensive than that of\\nthe highlands of Barbary. Professor Willis, of Cambridge, attributes\\nthe broad sounds and the guttural consonants of mountaineers and the\\npeople of elevated plains to the physical action of cold. Conceding\\nthis to be a partial cause, I would rather refer the phenomenon to the\\nhabit of loud speaking, acquired by the dwellers in tents, and by those\\nwho live much in the open air. The Todas of the Neilgherry Hills have\\ngiven the soft Tamil all the harshness of Arabic, and he who hears them\\ncalling to each other from the neighbouring peaks, can remark the\\nprocess of broadening vowel and gutturalising consonant. On the other\\nhand, the Gallas and the Persians, also a mountain-people, but\\ninhabiting houses, speak comparatively soft tongues. The Cairenes\\nactually omit some of the harshest sounds of Arabia, turning Makass\\ninto Ma\\xef\\xbf\\xbdas, and Sakka into Sa\\xef\\xbf\\xbda. It is impossible to help remarking the\\nbellowing of the Badawi when he first enters a dwelling-place, and the\\nsoftening of the sound when he has become accustomed to speak within\\nwalls. Moreover, it is to be observed there is a great difference of\\narticulation, not pronunciation, among the several Badawi clans. The\\nBenu Auf are recognised by their sharp, loud, and sudden speech, which\\nthe citizens compare to the barking of dogs. The Benu Amr, on the\\ncontrary, speak with a soft and drawling sound. The Hutaym, in addition\\nto other peculiarities, add a pleonastic \\xef\\xbf\\xbdah,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd to soften the termination of\\nwords, as A\\xef\\xbf\\xbdatini hawajiyah, (for hawaiji), \\xef\\xbf\\xbdGive me my clothes.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n[FN#36] The Germans have returned for inspiration to the old Eastern\\nsource. Ruckert was guided by Jalal al-Din to the fountains of Sufyism.\\nAnd even the French have of late made an inroad into Teutonic mysticism\\nsuccessfully enough to have astonished Racine and horrified La Harpe.\\n[FN#37] This, however, does not prevent the language becoming\\noptionally most precise in meaning; hence its high philosophical\\ncharacter. The word \\xef\\xbf\\xbdfarz,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd for instance, means, radically \\xef\\xbf\\xbdcutting,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\nsecondarily \\xef\\xbf\\xbdordering,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd or \\xef\\xbf\\xbdpaying a debt,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd after which come numerous meanings\\nforeign to the primal sense, such as a shield, part of a tinder-box, an\\nunfeathered arrow, and a particular kind of date. In theology it is\\nlimited to a single signification, namely, a divine command revealed in\\nthe Koran. Under these circumstances the Arabic becomes, in grammar,\\nlogic, rhetoric, and mathematics, as perfect and precise as Greek. I\\nhave heard Europeans complain that it is unfit for mercantile\\ntransactions.\\xef\\xbf\\xbdPerhaps!\\n[FN#38] As a general rule there is a rhyme at the end of every second\\nline, and the unison is a mere fringe\\xef\\xbf\\xbda long a, for instance, throughout\\nthe poem sufficing for the delicate ear of the Arab. In this they were\\nimitated by the old Spaniards, who, neglecting the consonants, merely\\nrequired the terminating vowels to be alike. We speak of the \\xef\\xbf\\xbdsort of\\nharmonious simple flow which atones for the imperfect nature of the\\nrhyme.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd But the fine organs of some races would be hurt by that ponderous\\nunison which a people of blunter senses find necessary to produce an\\nimpression. The reader will feel this after perusing in \\xef\\xbf\\xbdPercy\\xef\\xbf\\xbds Reliques\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\nRio Verde! Rio Verde! and its translation.\\n[FN#39] In our knightly ages the mare was ridden only by jugglers and\\ncharlatans. Did this custom arise from the hatred of, and contempt for,\\nthe habits of the Arabs, imported into Europe by the Crusaders?\\nCertainly the popular Eastern idea of a Frank was formed in those days,\\nand survives to these.\\n[FN#40] Baron Von Hammer-Purgstall, in the \\xef\\xbf\\xbdFalkner-Klee,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd calls this bird\\nthe \\xef\\xbf\\xbdSaker-falke.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd Hence the French and English names sacre and saker. The\\nlearned John Beckmann (History of Inventions, Discoveries, and Origins:\\nsub voce) derives falconry from India, where, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdas early as the time of\\nCtesias, hares and foxes were hunted by means of rapacious birds.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd I\\nbelieve, however, that no trace of this sport is found in the writings\\nof the Hindus. Beckmann agrees with Giraldus, against other literati,\\nthat the ancient Greeks knew the art of hawking, and proves from\\nAristotle, that in Thrace men trained falcons. But Aristotle alludes to\\nthe use of the bird, as an owl is employed in Italy: the falcon is\\ndescribed as frightening, not catching the birds. \\xef\\xbf\\xbdlian corroborates\\nAristotle\\xef\\xbf\\xbds testimony. Pliny, however, distinctly asserts that the hawks\\nstrike their prey down. \\xef\\xbf\\xbdIn Italy it was very common,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd says the learned\\nBeckmann, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdfor Martial and Apuleius speak of it as a thing everywhere\\nknown. Hence the science spread over Europe, and reached perfection at\\nthe principal courts in the twelfth century.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd The Emperor Frederic II.\\nwrote \\xef\\xbf\\xbdDe Arte Venandi cum Avibus,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd and the royal author was followed by a\\nhost of imitators in the vulgar tongue. Though I am not aware that the\\nHindus ever cultivated the art, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdlian, it must be confessed, describes\\ntheir style of training falcons exactly similar to that in use among\\nthe modern Persians, Sindians, and Arabs. The Emperor Frederic owes the\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbdcapella,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd or hood to the Badawi, and talks of the \\xef\\xbf\\xbdmost expert falconers\\xef\\xbf\\xbd sent\\nto him with various kinds of birds by some of the kings of Arabia. The\\norigin of falconry is ascribed by Al-Mas\\xef\\xbf\\xbdudi, on the authority of Adham\\nbin Muhriz, to the king Al-Haris bin Mu\\xef\\xbf\\xbdawiyah, and in Dr. Sprenger\\xef\\xbf\\xbds\\nadmirable translation the reader will find (pp. 426, 428), much\\ninformation upon the subject. The Persians claim the invention for\\ntheir just King, Anushirawan, contemporary with Mohammed. Thence the\\nsport passed into Turkey, where it is said the Sultans maintained a\\nbody of 6000 falconers. And Frederic Barbarossa, in the twelfth\\ncentury, brought falcons to Italy. We may fairly give the honour of the\\ninvention to Central Asia.\\n[FN#41] Here called \\xef\\xbf\\xbdbandukiyah bi ruhayn,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd or the two-mouthed gun.

The superstition may have\\narisen from the pebbles being flung up behind by the bird\\xef\\xbf\\xbds large feet in\\nhis rapid flight, or it may be a mere \\xef\\xbf\\xbdfoolery of fancy.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd Even in lands\\nwhich have long given up animal-worship, wherever a beast is\\nconspicuous or terrible, it becomes the subject of some marvellous\\ntale. So the bear in Persia imitates a moolah\\xef\\xbf\\xbds dress; the wolf in France\\nis a human being transformed, and the beaver of North America, also a\\nmetamorphosis, belts trees so as to fell them in the direction most\\nsuitable to his after purpose.\\n[FN#44] Not that the \\xef\\xbf\\xbdAgrebi\\xef\\xbf\\xbd of Bir Hamid and other parts have much to\\nlearn of us in vice. The land of Al-Yaman is, I believe, the most\\ndemoralised country, and Sana\\xef\\xbf\\xbda the most depraved city in Arabia. The\\nfair sex distinguishes itself by a peculiar laxity of conduct, which is\\nlooked upon with an indulgent eye. And the men drink and gamble, to say\\nnothing of other peccadilloes, with perfect impunity.\\n[FN#45] In Al-Yaman, it is believed, that if a man eat three heads of\\ngarlic in good mountain-samn (or clarified butter) for forty days, his\\nblood will kill the snake that draws it.\\n[FN#46] Circumcisionis causa apud Arabos manifestissima, ulceratio enim\\nendemica, abrasionem glandis aut praeputii, maxima cum facilitate\\ninsequitur.

The Spanish Government has refused to perpetuate its\\nPillar-dollar, which at one time was so great a favourite in the East.\\nThe traveller wonders how \\xef\\xbf\\xbdMaria Theresas\\xef\\xbf\\xbd still supply both shores of the\\nRed Sea. The marvel is easily explained: the Austrians receive silver\\nat Milan, and stamp it for a certain percentage. This coin was\\ndoubtless preferred by the Badawin for its superiority to the currency\\nof the day: they make from it ornaments for their women and decorations\\nfor their weapons. The generic term for dollars is \\xef\\xbf\\xbdRiyal Fransah.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n[FN#48] Torale, sicut est mos Judaicus et Persicus, non inspiciunt.\\nNovae nuptae tamen maritus mappam manu capit: mane autem puellae mater\\nvirginitatis signa viris mulieribusque domi ostendit eosque jubilare\\njubet quod calamitas domestica, sc. filia, intacta abiit.

In\\nAl-Hijaz they have many local and fantastic terms: the smallest kind,\\nfor instance, is called Jarad Iblis, Satan\\xef\\xbf\\xbds locust.\\n[FN#56] This is the Kurut of Sind and the Kashk of Persia.

I have seen a work upon the subject in four folio volumes in\\npoint of matter equivalent to treble the number in Europe. The best\\nknown genealogical works are Al-Kalkashandi (originally in seventy-five\\nbooks, extended to one hundred); the Umdat al-Tullab by Ibn Khaldun;\\nthe \\xef\\xbf\\xbdTohfat al-Arab fi Ansar al-Arab,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd a well-known volume by Al-Siyuti;\\nand, lastly, the Sirat al-Halabi, in six volumes 8vo.

Some rate the Benu Harb at 6000;\\nothers, equally well informed, at 15,000; others again at 80,000. The\\nreason of this is that, whilst one is speaking of the whole race,\\nanother may be limiting it to his own tribe and its immediate allies.\\n[FN#64] \\xef\\xbf\\xbdSham\\xef\\xbf\\xbd which, properly speaking, means Damascus or Syria, in\\nSouthern Arabia and Eastern Africa is universally applied to Al-Hijaz.\\n</p>\\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Chapter_XXVI._FROM_AL-SUWAYRKIYAH_TO_MECCAH.\">Chapter XXVI.

Al-Suwayrkiyah, which\\nbelongs to the Sharif of Meccah, is about twenty-eight miles distant\\nfrom Hijriyah, and by dead reckoning ninety-nine miles along the road\\nfrom the Prophet\\xef\\xbf\\xbds burial-place. Its bearing from the last station was\\nS.W. 11\\xef\\xbf\\xbd. The town, consisting of about one hundred houses, is built at\\nthe base and on the sides of a basaltic mass, which rises abruptly from\\nthe hard clayey plain. The summit is converted into a rude\\nfortalice\\xef\\xbf\\xbdwithout one, no settlement can exist in Al-Hijaz\\xef\\xbf\\xbdby a bulwark of\\nuncut stone, piled up so as to make a parapet. The lower part of the\\ntown is protected by a mud wall, with the usual semicircular towers.\\nInside there is a bazar, well supplied with meat (principally mutton)\\nby the neighbouring Badawin; and wheat, barley, and dates are grown\\nnear the town. There is little to describe in the narrow streets and\\nthe mud houses, which are essentially Arab. The fields around are\\ndivided into little square plots by earthen ridges and stone walls;\\nsome of the palms are fine-grown trees, and the wells appear numerous.\\nThe water is near the surface and plentiful, but it has a brackish\\ntaste, highly disagreeable after a few days\\xef\\xbf\\xbd use, and the effects are the\\nreverse of chalybeate.\\n</p><p>The town belongs to the Benu Hosayn, a race of\\n</p><p>[p.125] schismatics mentioned in the foregoing pages. They claim the\\nallegiance of the Badawi tribes around, principally Mutayr, and I was\\ninformed that their fealty to the Prince of Meccah is merely nominal.\\n</p><p>The morning after our arrival at Al-Suwayrkiyah witnessed a commotion\\nin our little party: hitherto they had kept together in fear of the\\nroad. Among the number was one Ali bin Ya Sin, a perfect \\xef\\xbf\\xbdold man of the\\nsea.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd By profession he was a \\xef\\xbf\\xbdZemzemi,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd or dispenser of water from the Holy\\nWell,[FN#1] and he had a handsome \\xef\\xbf\\xbdpalazzo\\xef\\xbf\\xbd at the foot of Abu Kubays in\\nMeccah, which he periodically converted into a boarding-house. Though\\npast sixty, very decrepit, bent by age, white-bearded, and toothless,\\nhe still acted cicerone to pilgrims, and for that purpose travelled\\nonce every year to Al-Madinah. These trips had given him the cunning of\\na veteran voyageur. He lived well and cheaply; his home-made Shugduf,\\nthe model of comfort, was garnished with soft cushions and pillows,\\nwhilst from the pockets protruded select bottles of pickled limes and\\nsimilar luxuries; he had his travelling Shishah (water-pipe),[FN#2] and\\nat the halting-place, disdaining the crowded, reeking tent, he had a\\ncontrivance for converting his vehicle into a habitation. He was a type\\nof the Arab old man. He mumbled all day and three-quarters of the\\nnight, for he had des insomnies. His nerves were so fine, that if any\\n</p><p>[p.126] one mounted his Shugduf, the unfortunate was condemned to lie\\nlike a statue. Fidgety and priggishly neat, nothing annoyed him so much\\nas a moment\\xef\\xbf\\xbds delay or an article out of place, a rag removed from his\\nwater-gugglet, or a cooking-pot imperfectly free from soot; and I\\njudged his avarice by observing that he made a point of picking up and\\neating the grains scattered from our pomegranates, exclaiming that the\\nheavenly seed (located there by Arab superstition) might be one of\\nthose so wantonly wasted.\\n</p><p>Ali bin Ya Sin, returning to his native city, had not been happy in his\\nchoice of a companion this time. The other occupant of the handsome\\nShugduf was an ignoble-faced Egyptian from Al-Madinah. This ill-suited\\npair clave together for awhile, but at Al-Suwayrkiyah some dispute\\nabout a copper coin made them permanent foes. With threats and abuse\\nsuch as none but an Egyptian could tamely hear, Ali kicked his quondam\\nfriend out of the vehicle. But terrified, after reflection, by the\\npossibility that the man, now his enemy, might combine with two or\\nthree Syrians of our party to do him a harm, and frightened by a few\\nblack looks, the senior determined to fortify himself by a friend.\\nConnected with the boy Mohammed\\xef\\xbf\\xbds family, he easily obtained an\\nintroduction to me; he kissed my hand with great servility, declared\\nthat his servant had behaved disgracefully; and begged my protection\\ntogether with an occasional attendance of my \\xef\\xbf\\xbdslave.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n</p><p>This was readily granted in pity for the old man, who became immensely\\ngrateful. He offered at once to take Shaykh Nur into his Shugduf. The\\nIndian boy had already reduced to ruins the frail structure of his\\nShibriyah by lying upon it lengthways, whereas prudent travellers sit\\nin it cross-legged and facing the camel. Moreover, he had been laughed\\nto scorn by the Badawin, who seeing him pull up his dromedary to mount\\nand dismount, had questioned his sex, and determined him to be\\n</p><p>[p.127] a woman of the \\xef\\xbf\\xbdMiyan.[FN#3]\\xef\\xbf\\xbd I could not rebuke them; the poor\\nfellow\\xef\\xbf\\xbds timidity was a ridiculous contrast to the Badawi\\xef\\xbf\\xbds style of\\nmounting; a pull at the camel\\xef\\xbf\\xbds head, the left foot placed on the neck,\\nan agile spring, and a scramble into the saddle. Shaykh Nur, elated by\\nthe sight of old Ali\\xef\\xbf\\xbds luxuries, promised himself some joyous hours; but\\nnext morning he owned with a sigh that he had purchased splendour at\\nthe extravagant price of happiness\\xef\\xbf\\xbdthe senior\\xef\\xbf\\xbds tongue never rested\\nthroughout the livelong night.\\n</p><p>During our half-halt at Al-Suwayrkiyah we determined to have a small\\nfeast; we bought some fresh dates, and we paid a dollar and a half for\\na sheep. Hungry travellers consider \\xef\\xbf\\xbdliver and fry\\xef\\xbf\\xbd a dish to set before a\\nShaykh. On this occasion, however, our enjoyment was marred by the\\nwater; even Soyer\\xef\\xbf\\xbds dinners would scarcely charm if washed down with cups\\nof a certain mineral-spring found at Epsom.\\n</p><p>We started at ten A.M. (Monday, 5th September) in a South-Easterly\\ndirection, and travelled over a flat, thinly dotted with Desert\\nvegetation. At one P.M we passed a basaltic ridge; and then, entering a\\nlong depressed line of country, a kind of valley, paced down it five\\ntedious hours. The Samum as usual was blowing hard, and it seemed to\\naffect the travellers\\xef\\xbf\\xbd tempers. In one place I saw a Turk, who could not\\nspeak a word of Arabic, violently disputing with an Arab who could not\\nunderstand a word of Turkish. The pilgrim insisted upon adding to the\\ncamel\\xef\\xbf\\xbds load a few dry sticks, such as are picked up for cooking. The\\ncamel-man as perseveringly threw off the extra burthen. They screamed\\nwith rage, hustled each other, and at last the Turk dealt the Arab a\\nheavy blow. I afterwards heard that the pilgrim was mortally wounded\\nthat night, his stomach being ripped\\n</p><p>[p.128] open with a dagger. On enquiring what had become of him, I was\\nassured that he had been comfortably wrapped up in his shroud, and\\nplaced in a half-dug grave. This is the general practice in the case of\\nthe poor and solitary, whom illness or accident incapacitates from\\nproceeding. It is impossible to contemplate such a fate without horror:\\nthe torturing thirst of a wound,[FN#4] the burning sun heating the\\nbrain to madness, and\\xef\\xbf\\xbdworst of all, for they do not wait till death\\xef\\xbf\\xbdthe\\nattacks of the jackal, the vulture, and the raven of the wild.\\n</p><p>At six P.M., before the light of day had faded, we traversed a rough\\nand troublesome ridge. Descending it our course lay in a southerly\\ndirection along a road flanked on the left by low hills of red\\nsandstone and bright porphyry. About an hour afterwards we came to a\\nbasalt field, through whose blocks we threaded our way painfully and\\nslowly, for it was then dark. At eight P.M. the camels began to stumble\\nover the dwarf dykes of the wheat and barley fields, and presently we\\narrived at our halting-place, a large village called Al-Sufayna. The\\nplain was already dotted with tents and lights. We found the Baghdad\\nCaravan, whose route here falls into the Darb al-Sharki. It consists of\\na few Persians and Kurds, and collects the people of North-Eastern\\nArabia, Wahhabis and others. They are escorted by the Agayl tribe and\\nby the fierce mountaineers of Jabal Shammar. Scarcely was our tent\\npitched, when the distant pattering of musketry and an ominous tapping\\nof the kettle-drum sent all my companions in different directions to\\nenquire what was the cause of quarrel. The Baghdad Cafilah, though not\\nmore than 2000 in number, men, women and children, had been proving to\\nthe Damascus Caravan, that, being perfectly ready to fight, they were\\nnot going to yield any point of precedence. From that time the two\\nbodies\\n</p><p>[p.129] encamped in different places. I never saw a more pugnacious\\nassembly: a look sufficed for a quarrel. Once a Wahhabi stood in front\\nof us, and by pointing with his finger and other insulting gestures,\\nshowed his hatred to the chibuk, in which I was peaceably indulging. It\\nwas impossible to refrain from chastising his insolence by a polite and\\nsmiling offer of the offending pipe. This made him draw his dagger\\nwithout a thought; but it was sheathed again, for we all cocked our\\npistols, and these gentry prefer steel to lead. We had travelled about\\nseventeen miles, and the direction of Al-Sufayna from our last halting\\nplace was South-East five degrees. Though it was night when we\\nencamped, Shaykh Mas\\xef\\xbf\\xbdud set out to water his moaning camels: they had not\\nquenched their thirst for three days. He returned in a depressed state,\\nhaving been bled by the soldiery at the well to the extent of forty\\npiastres, or about eight shillings.\\n</p><p>After supper we spread our rugs and prepared to rest. And here I first\\nremarked the coolness of the nights, proving, at this season of the\\nyear, a considerable altitude above the sea. As a general rule the\\natmosphere stagnated between sunrise and ten A.M., when a light wind\\nrose. During the forenoon the breeze strengthened, and it gradually\\ndiminished through the afternoon. Often about sunset there was a gale\\naccompanied by dry storms of dust. At Al-Sufayna, though there was no\\nnight-breeze and little dew, a blanket was necessary, and the hours of\\ndarkness were invigorating enough to mitigate the effect of the sand\\nand Samum-ridden day. Before sleeping I was introduced to a namesake,\\none Shaykh Abdullah, of Meccah. Having committed his Shugduf to his\\nson, a lad of fourteen, he had ridden forward on a dromedary, and had\\nsuddenly fallen ill. His objects in meeting me were to ask for some\\nmedicine, and for a temporary seat in my Shugduf; the latter I offered\\nwith pleasure, as the boy Mohammed was\\n</p><p>[p.130] longing to mount a camel. The Shaykh\\xef\\xbf\\xbds illness was nothing but\\nweakness brought on by the hardships of the journey: he attributed it\\nto the hot wind, and to the weight of a bag of dollars which he had\\nattached to his waist-belt. He was a man about forty, long, thin, pale,\\nand of a purely nervous temperament; and a few questions elicited the\\nfact that he had lately and suddenly given up his daily opium pill. I\\nprepared one for him, placed him in my litter, and persuaded him to\\nstow away his burden in some place where it would be less troublesome.\\nHe was my companion for two marches, at the end of which he found his\\nown Shugduf. I never met amongst the Arab citizens a better bred or a\\nbetter informed man. At Constantinople he had learned a little French,\\nItalian, and Greek; and from the properties of a shrub to the varieties\\nof honey,[FN#5] he was full of \\xef\\xbf\\xbd useful knowledge,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd and openable as a\\ndictionary. We parted near Meccah, where I met him only once, and then\\naccidentally, in the Valley of Muna.\\n</p><p>At half-past five A.M. on Tuesday, the 6th of September, we rose\\nrefreshed by the cool, comfortable night, and loaded the camels. I had\\nan opportunity of inspecting Al-Sufayna. It is a village of fifty or\\nsixty mud-walled, flat-roofed houses, defended by the usual rampart.\\nAround it lie ample date-grounds, and fields of wheat, barley, and\\nmaize. Its bazar at this season of the year is well supplied: even\\nfowls can be procured.\\n</p><p>We travelled towards the South-East, and entered a country destitute of\\nthe low ranges of hill, which from Al-Madinah southwards had bounded\\nthe horizon. After\\n</p><p>[p.131] a two miles\\xef\\xbf\\xbd march our camels climbed up a precipitous ridge, and\\nthen descended into a broad gravel plain. From ten to eleven A.M. our\\ncourse lay southerly over a high table-land, and we afterwards\\ntraversed, for five hours and a half, a plain which bore signs of\\nstanding water. This day\\xef\\xbf\\xbds march was peculiarly Arabia. It was a desert\\npeopled only with echoes,\\xef\\xbf\\xbda place of death for what little there is to\\ndie in it,\\xef\\xbf\\xbda wilderness where, to use my companion\\xef\\xbf\\xbds phrase, there is\\nnothing but He.[FN#6] Nature scalped, flayed, discovered all her\\nskeleton to the gazer\\xef\\xbf\\xbds eye. The horizon was a sea of mirage; gigantic\\nsand-columns whirled over the plain; and on both sides of our road were\\nhuge piles of bare rock, standing detached upon the surface of sand and\\nclay. Here they appeared in oval lumps, heaped up with a semblance of\\nsymmetry; there a single boulder stood, with its narrow foundation\\nbased upon a pedestal of low, dome-shapen rock. All were of a pink\\ncoarse-grained granite, which flakes off in large crusts under the\\ninfluence of the atmosphere. I remarked one block which could not\\nmeasure fewer than thirty feet in height. Through these scenes we\\ntravelled till about half-past four P.M., when the guns suddenly roared\\na halt. There was not a trace of human habitation around us: a few\\nparched shrubs and the granite heaps were the only objects diversifying\\nthe hard clayey plain. Shaykh Mas\\xef\\xbf\\xbdud correctly guessed the cause of our\\ndetention at the inhospitable \\xef\\xbf\\xbdhalting-place of the Mutayr\\xef\\xbf\\xbd (Badawin). \\xef\\xbf\\xbdCook\\nyour bread and boil your coffee,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd said the old man; \\xef\\xbf\\xbdthe camels will rest\\nfor awhile, and the gun will sound at nightfall.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n</p><p>We had passed over about eighteen miles of ground; and our present\\ndirection was South-west twenty degrees of Al-Sufayna.\\n</p><p>At half-past ten that evening we heard the signal for\\n</p><p>[p.132] departure, and, as the moon was still young, we prepared for a\\nhard night\\xef\\xbf\\xbds work. We took a south-westerly course through what is called\\na Wa\\xef\\xbf\\xbdar\\xef\\xbf\\xbdrough ground covered with thicket. Darkness fell upon us like a\\npall. The camels tripped and stumbled, tossing their litters like\\ncockboats in a short sea; at times the Shugdufs were well nigh torn off\\ntheir backs. When we came to a ridge worse than usual, old Mas\\xef\\xbf\\xbdud would\\nseize my camel\\xef\\xbf\\xbds halter, and, accompanied by his son and nephew bearing\\nlights, encourage the animals with gesture and voice. It was a strange,\\nwild scene. The black basaltic field was dotted with the huge and\\ndoubtful forms of spongy-footed camels with silent tread, looming like\\nphantoms in the midnight air; the hot wind moaned, and whirled from the\\ntorches flakes and sheets of flame and fiery smoke, whilst ever and\\nanon a swift-travelling Takht-rawan, drawn by mules, and surrounded by\\nrunners bearing gigantic mashals or cressets,[FN#7] threw a passing\\nglow of red light upon the dark road and the dusky multitude. On this\\noccasion the rule was \\xef\\xbf\\xbdevery man for himself.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd Each pressed forward into\\nthe best path, thinking only of preceding his neighbour. The Syrians,\\namongst whom our little party had become entangled, proved most\\nunpleasant companions: they often stopped the way, insisting upon their\\nright to precedence. On one occasion a horseman had the audacity to\\nuntie the halter of my dromedary, and thus to cast us adrift, as it\\nwere, in order to make room for some excluded friend. I seized my\\nsword; but Shaykh Abdullah stayed my hand, and addressed the intruder\\nin terms sufficiently violent to make him slink away. Nor was this the\\nonly occasion on which my\\n</p><p>[p.133] companion was successful with the Syrians. He would begin with\\na mild \\xef\\xbf\\xbdMove a little, O my father!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd followed, if fruitless, by \\xef\\xbf\\xbdOut of the\\nway, O Father of Syria[FN#8]!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd and if still ineffectual, advancing to a\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbdBegone, O he!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd This ranged between civility and sternness. If without\\neffect, it was supported by revilings to the \\xef\\xbf\\xbdAbusers of the Salt,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd the\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbdYazid,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd the \\xef\\xbf\\xbdOffspring of Shimr.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd Another remark which I made about my\\ncompanion\\xef\\xbf\\xbds conduct well illustrates the difference between the Eastern\\nand the Western man. When traversing a dangerous place, Shaykh Abdullah\\nthe European attended to his camel with loud cries of \\xef\\xbf\\xbdHai! Hai[FN#9]!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd and\\nan occasional switching. Shaykh Abdullah the Asiatic commended himself\\nto Allah by repeated ejaculations of Ya Satir! Ya Sattar[FN#10]!\\n</p><p>[p.134]The morning of Wednesday (September 7th) broke as we entered a\\nwide plain. In many places were signs of water: lines of basalt here\\nand there seamed the surface, and wide sheets of the tufaceous gypsum\\ncalled by the Arabs Sabkhah shone like mirrors set in the russet\\nframework of the flat. This substance is found in cakes, often a foot\\nlong by an inch in depth, curled by the sun\\xef\\xbf\\xbds rays and overlying clay\\ninto which water had sunk. After our harassing night, day came on with\\na sad feeling of oppression, greatly increased by the unnatural glare:\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n</p><p>\\xef\\xbf\\xbdIn vain the sight, dejected to the ground,\\nStoop\\xef\\xbf\\xbdd for relief: thence hot ascending streams\\nAnd keen reflection pain\\xef\\xbf\\xbdd.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n</p><p>We were disappointed in our expectations of water, which usually\\nabounds near this station, as its name, Al-Ghadir, denotes. At ten A.M.\\nwe pitched the tent in the first convenient spot, and we lost no time\\nin stretching our cramped limbs upon the bosom of mother Earth. From\\nthe halting-place of the Mutayr to Al-Ghadir is a march of about twenty\\nmiles, and the direction south-west twenty-one degrees. Al-Ghadir is an\\nextensive plain, which probably presents the appearance of a lake after\\nheavy rains. It is overgrown in parts with Desert vegetation, and\\nrequires nothing but a regular supply of water to make it useful to\\nman. On the East it is bounded by a wall of rock, at whose base are\\nthree wells, said to have been dug by the Caliph Harun. They are\\nguarded by a Burj, or tower, which betrays symptoms of decay.\\n</p><p>In our anxiety to rest we had strayed from the Damascus Caravan amongst\\nthe mountaineers of Shammar. Our Shaykh Mas\\xef\\xbf\\xbdud manifestly did not like\\nthe company; for shortly after three P.M. he insisted upon our striking\\nthe tent and rejoining the Hajj, which lay encamped about two miles\\ndistant in the western part of the basin. We\\n</p><p>[p.135] loaded, therefore, and half an hour before sunset found\\nourselves in more congenial society. To my great disappointment, a stir\\nwas observable in the Caravan. I at once understood that another\\nnight-march was in store for us.\\n</p><p>At six P.M. we again mounted, and turned towards the Eastern plain. A\\nheavy shower was falling upon the Western hills, whence came damp and\\ndangerous blasts. Between nine P.M. and the dawn of the next day we had\\na repetition of the last night\\xef\\xbf\\xbds scenes, over a road so rugged and\\ndangerous, that I wondered how men could prefer to travel in the\\ndarkness. But the camels of Damascus were now worn out with fatigue;\\nthey could not endure the sun, and our time was too precious for a\\nhalt. My night was spent perched upon the front bar of my Shugduf,\\nencouraging the dromedary; and that we had not one fall excited my\\nextreme astonishment. At five A.M. (Thursday, 8th September) we entered\\na wide plain thickly clothed with the usual thorny trees, in whose\\nstrong grasp many a Shugduf lost its covering, and not a few were\\ndragged with their screaming inmates to the ground. About five hours\\nafterwards we crossed a high ridge, and saw below us the camp of the\\nCaravan, not more than two miles distant. As we approached it, a figure\\ncame running out to meet us. It was the boy Mohammed, who, heartily\\ntired of riding a dromedary with his friend, and possibly hungry,\\nhastened to inform my companion Abdullah that he would lead him to his\\nShugduf and to his son. The Shaykh, a little offended by the fact that\\nfor two days not a friend nor an acquaintance had taken the trouble to\\nsee or to inquire about him, received Mohammed roughly; but the youth,\\nguessing the grievance, explained it away by swearing that he and all\\nthe party had tried in vain to find us. This wore the semblance of\\ntruth: it is almost impossible to come upon any one who strays from his\\nplace in so large and motley a body.\\n</p><p>[p.136]At eleven A.M. we had reached our station. It is about\\nwenty-four miles from Al-Ghadir, and its direction is South-east ten\\ndegrees. It is called Al-Birkat (the Tank), from a large and now\\nruinous cistern built of hewn stone by the Caliph Harun.[FN#11] The\\nland belongs to the Utaybah Badawin, the bravest and most ferocious\\ntribe in Al-Hijaz; and the citizens denote their dread of these\\nbanditti by asserting that to increase their courage they drink their\\nenemy\\xef\\xbf\\xbds blood.[FN#12] My companions shook their heads when questioned\\nupon the subject, and prayed that we might not become too well\\nacquainted with them\\xef\\xbf\\xbdan ill-omened speech!\\n</p><p>The Pasha allowed us a rest of five hours at Al-Birkat: we spent them\\nin my tent, which was crowded with Shaykh Abdullah\\xef\\xbf\\xbds friends. To requite\\nme for this inconvenience, he prepared for me an excellent water-pipe,\\na cup of coffee, which, untainted by cloves and by cinnamon, would have\\nbeen delicious, and a dish of dry fruits. As we were now near the Holy\\nCity, all the Meccans were busy canvassing for lodgers and offering\\ntheir services to pilgrims. Quarrels, too, were of hourly occurrence.\\nIn our party was an Arnaut, a white-bearded old man, so\\n</p><p>[p.137] decrepit that he could scarcely stand, and yet so violent that\\nno one could manage him but his African slave, a brazen-faced little\\nwretch about fourteen years of age. Words were bandied between this\\nangry senior and Shaykh Mas\\xef\\xbf\\xbdud, when the latter insinuated sarcastically,\\nthat if the former had teeth he would be more intelligible. The Arnaut\\nin his rage seized a pole, raised it, and delivered a blow which missed\\nthe camel-man, but, which brought the striker headlong to the ground.\\nMas\\xef\\xbf\\xbdud exclaimed, with shrieks of rage, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdHave we come to this, that every\\nold-woman Turk smites us?\\xef\\xbf\\xbd Our party had the greatest trouble to quiet\\nthe quarrel[l]ers. The Arab listened to us when we threatened him with\\nthe Pasha. But the Arnaut, whose rage was \\xef\\xbf\\xbdlike red-hot steel,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd would hear\\nnothing but our repeated declarations, that unless he behaved more like\\na pilgrim, we should be compelled to leave him and his slave behind.\\n</p><p>At four P.M. we left Al-Birkat, and travelled Eastwards over rolling\\nground thickly wooded. There was a network of footpaths through the\\nthickets, and clouds obscured the moon; the consequence was inevitable\\nloss of way. About 2 A.M. we began ascending hills in a south-westerly\\ndirection, and presently we fell into the bed of a large rock-girt\\nFiumara, which runs from east to west. The sands were overgrown with\\nsaline and salsolaceous plants; the Coloquintida, which, having no\\nsupport, spreads along the ground[FN#13]; the Senna, with its small\\ngreen leaf; the Rhazya stricta[FN#14]; and a large luxuriant variety of\\nthe Asclepias gigantea,[FN#15] cottoned over with\\n</p><p>[p.138] mist and dew. At 6 A.M. (Sept. 9th) we left the Fiumara, and,\\nturning to the West, we arrived about an hour afterwards at the\\nstation. Al-Zaribah, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdthe valley,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd is an undulating plain amongst high\\ngranite hills. In many parts it was faintly green; water was close to\\nthe surface, and rain stood upon the ground. During the night we had\\ntravelled about twenty-three miles, and our present station was\\nsouth-east 56\\xef\\xbf\\xbd from our last.\\n</p><p>Having pitched the tent and eaten and slept, we prepared to perform the\\nceremony of Al-Ihram (assuming the pilgrim-garb), as Al-Zaribah is the\\nMikat, or the appointed place.[FN#16] Between the noonday and the\\nafternoon prayers a barber attended to shave our heads, cut our nails,\\nand trim our mustachios. Then, having bathed and perfumed ourselves,\\xef\\xbf\\xbdthe\\nlatter is a questionable\\n</p><p>[p.139] point,\\xef\\xbf\\xbdwe donned the attire, which is nothing but two new cotton\\ncloths, each six feet long by three and a half broad, white, with\\nnarrow red stripes and fringes: in fact, the costume called Al-Eddeh,\\nin the baths at Cairo.[FN#17] One of these sheets, technically termed\\nthe Rida, is thrown over the back, and, exposing the arm and shoulder,\\nis knotted at the right side in the style Wishah. The Izar is wrapped\\nround the loins from waist to knee, and, knotted or tucked in at the\\nmiddle, supports itself. Our heads were bare, and nothing was allowed\\nupon the instep.[FN#18] It is said that some clans of Arabs still\\npreserve this religious but most uncomfortable costume; it is doubtless\\nof ancient date, and to this day, in the regions lying west of the Red\\nSea, it continues to be the common dress of the people.\\n</p><p>After the toilette, we were placed with our faces in the direction of\\nMeccah, and ordered to say aloud,[FN#19] \\xef\\xbf\\xbdI vow this Ihram of Hajj (the\\npilgrimage) and the Umrah (the Little pilgrimage) to Allah Almighty!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\nHaving thus performed a two-bow prayer, we repeated, without rising\\nfrom the sitting position, these words, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdO Allah! verily I purpose the\\nHajj and the Umrah, then enable me to accomplish the two, and accept\\nthem both of me, and make both blessed to me!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd Followed the Talbiyat, or\\nexclaiming\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n</p><p>\\xef\\xbf\\xbdHere I am! O Allah! here am I\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\nNo partner hast Thou, here am I;\\nVerily the praise and the grace are Thine, and the empire\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n</p><p>[p.140]\\tNo partner hast Thou, here am I[FN#20]!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd And we were warned to\\nrepeat these words as often as possible, until the conclusion of the\\nceremonies. Then Shaykh Abdullah, who acted as director of our\\nconsciences, bade us be good pilgrims, avoiding quarrels, immorality,\\nbad language, and light conversation. We must so reverence life that we\\nshould avoid killing game, causing an animal to fly, and even pointing\\nit out for destruction[FN#21]; nor should we scratch ourselves, save\\nwith the open palm, lest vermin be destroyed, or a hair uprooted by the\\nnail. We were to respect the sanctuary by sparing the trees, and not to\\npluck a single blade of grass. As regards personal considerations, we\\nwere to abstain from all oils, perfumes, and unguents; from washing the\\nhead with mallow or with lote leaves; from dyeing, shaving, cutting, or\\nvellicating a single pile or hair; and though we might take advantage\\nof shade, and even form it with upraised hands, we must by no means\\ncover our sconces. For each infraction of these ordinances we must\\nsacrifice a sheep[FN#22]; and it is commonly said by Moslems that none\\n</p><p>[p.141] but the Prophet could be perfect in the intricacies of\\npilgrimage. Old Ali began with an irregularity: he declared that age\\nprevented his assuming the garb, but that, arrived at Meccah, he would\\nclear himself by an offering.\\n</p><p>The wife and daughters of a Turkish pilgrim of our party assumed the\\nIhram at the same time as ourselves. They appeared dresse in white\\ngarments; and they had exchanged the Lisam, that coquettish fold of\\nmuslin which veils without concealing the lower part of the face, for a\\nhideous mask, made of split, dried, and plaited palm-leaves, with two\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbdbulls\\xef\\xbf\\xbd-eyes\\xef\\xbf\\xbd for light.[FN#23] I could not help laughing when these strange\\nfigures met my sight, and, to judge from the shaking of their\\nshoulders, they were not less susceptible to the merriment which they\\nhad caused.\\n</p><p>At three P.M. we left Al-Zaribah, travelling towards the South-West,\\nand a wondrously picturesque scene met the eye. Crowds hurried along,\\nhabited in the pilgrim-garb, whose whiteness contrasted strangely with\\ntheir black skins; their newly shaven heads glistening in the sun, and\\ntheir long black hair streaming in the wind. The rocks rang with shouts\\nof Labbayk! Labbayk! At a pass we fell in with the Wahhabis,\\naccompanying the Baghdad Caravan, screaming \\xef\\xbf\\xbdHere am I\\xef\\xbf\\xbd; and, guided by a\\nlarge loud kettle-drum, they followed in double file the camel of a\\nstandard-bearer, whose green flag bore in huge white letters the\\nformula of the Moslem creed. They were wild-looking mountaineers, dark\\nand fierce, with hair twisted into thin Dalik or plaits: each was armed\\nwith a long spear, a matchlock, or a dagger. They were seated upon\\ncoarse wooden saddles, without cushions or stirrups, a fine\\nsaddle-cloth alone denoting a\\n</p><p>[p.142] chief. The women emulated the men; they either guided their own\\ndromedaries, or, sitting in pillion, they clung to their husbands;\\nveils they disdained, and their countenances certainly belonged not to\\na \\xef\\xbf\\xbdsoft sex.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd These Wahhabis were by no means pleasant companions. Most of\\nthem were followed by spare dromedaries, either unladen or carrying\\nwater-skins, fodder, fuel, and other necessaries for the march. The\\nbeasts delighted in dashing furiously through our file, which being\\nlashed together, head and tail, was thrown each time into the greatest\\nconfusion. And whenever we were observed smoking, we were cursed aloud\\nfor Infidels and Idolaters.\\n</p><p>Looking back at Al-Zaribah, soon after our departure, I saw a heavy\\nnimbus settle upon the hill-tops, a sheet of rain being stretched\\nbetween it and the plain. The low grumbling of thunder sounded joyfully\\nin our ears. We hoped for a shower, but were disappointed by a\\ndust-storm, which ended with a few heavy drops. There arose a report\\nthat the Badawin had attacked a party of Meccans with stones, and the\\nnews caused men to look exceeding grave.\\n</p><p>At five P.M. we entered the wide bed of the Fiumara, down which we were\\nto travel all night. Here the country falls rapidly towards the sea, as\\nthe increasing heat of the air, the direction of the watercourses, and\\nsigns of violence in the torrent-bed show. The Fiumara varies in\\nbreadth from a hundred and fifty feet to three-quarters of a mile; its\\ncourse, I was told, is towards the South-West, and it enters the sea\\nnear Jeddah. The channel is a coarse sand, with here and there masses\\nof sheet rock and patches of thin vegetation.\\n</p><p>At about half-past five P.M. we entered a suspicious-looking place. On\\nthe right was a stony buttress, along whose base the stream, when there\\nis one, swings; and to this depression was our road limited by the\\nrocks and thorn trees which filled the other half of the channel.\\n</p><p>[p.143] The left side was a precipice, grim and barren, but not so\\nabrupt as its brother. Opposite us the way seemed barred by piles of\\nhills, crest rising above crest into the far blue distance. Day still\\nsmiled upon the upper peaks, but the lower slopes and the Fiumara bed\\nwere already curtained with grey sombre shade.\\n</p><p>A damp seemed to fall upon our spirits as we approached this Valley\\nPerilous. I remarked that the voices of the women and children sank\\ninto silence, and the loud Labbayk of the pilgrims were gradually\\nstilled. Whilst still speculating upon the cause of this phenomenon, it\\nbecame apparent. A small curl of the smoke, like a lady\\xef\\xbf\\xbds ringlet, on the\\nsummit of the right-hand precipice, caught my eye; and simultaneous\\nwith the echoing crack of the matchlock, a high-trotting dromedary in\\nfront of me rolled over upon the sands,\\xef\\xbf\\xbda bullet had split its\\nheart,\\xef\\xbf\\xbdthrowing the rider a goodly somersault of five or six yards.\\n</p><p>Ensued terrible confusion; women screamed, children cried, and men\\nvociferated, each one striving with might and main to urge his animal\\nout of the place of death. But the road being narrow, they only managed\\nto jam the vehicles in a solid immovable mass. At every match-lock\\nshot, a shudder ran through the huge body, as when the surgeon\\xef\\xbf\\xbds scalpel\\ntouches some more sensitive nerve. The Irregular horsemen, perfectly\\nuseless, galloped up and down over the stones, shouting to and ordering\\none another. The Pasha of the army had his carpet spread at the foot of\\nthe left-hand precipice, and debated over his pipe with the officers\\nwhat ought to be done. No good genius whispered \\xef\\xbf\\xbdCrown the heights.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n</p><p>Then it was that the conduct of the Wahhabis found favour in my eyes.\\nThey came up, galloping their camels,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n</p><p>\\xef\\xbf\\xbdTorrents less rapid, and less rash,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n</p><p>with their elf-locks tossing in the wind, and their flaring\\n</p><p>[p.144] matches casting a strange lurid light over their features.\\nTaking up a position, one body began to fire upon the Utaybah robbers,\\nwhilst two or three hundred, dismounting, swarmed up the hill under the\\nguidance of the Sharif Zayd. I had remarked this nobleman at Al-Madinah\\nas a model specimen of the pure Arab. Like all Sharifs, he is\\ncelebrated for bravery, and has killed many with his own hand.[FN#24]\\nWhen urged at Al-Zaribah to ride into Meccah, he swore that he would\\nnot leave the Caravan till in sight of the walls; and, fortunately for\\nthe pilgrims, he kept his word. Presently the firing was heard far in\\nour rear, the robbers having fled. The head of the column advanced, and\\nthe dense body of pilgrims opened out. Our forced halt was now\\nexchanged for a flight. It required much management to steer our\\nDesert-craft clear of danger; but Shaykh Mas\\xef\\xbf\\xbdud was equal to the\\noccasion. That many were not, was evident by the boxes and baggage that\\nstrewed the shingles. I had no means of ascertaining the number of men\\nkilled and wounded: reports were contradictory, and exaggeration\\nunanimous. The robbers were said to be a hundred and fifty in number;\\ntheir object was plunder, and they would eat the shot camels. But their\\nprincipal ambition was the boast, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdWe, the Utaybah, on such and such a\\n[p.145] night, stopped the Sultan\\xef\\xbf\\xbds Mahmil one whole hour in the Pass.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n</p><p>At the beginning of the skirmish I had primed my pistols, and sat with\\nthem ready for use. But soon seeing that there was nothing to be done,\\nand wishing to make an impression,\\xef\\xbf\\xbdnowhere does Bobadil now \\xef\\xbf\\xbdgo down\\xef\\xbf\\xbd so well\\nas in the East,\\xef\\xbf\\xbdI called aloud for my supper. Shaykh Nur, exanimate with\\nfear, could not move. The boy Mohammed ejaculated only an \\xef\\xbf\\xbdOh, sir!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd and\\nthe people around exclaimed in disgust, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdBy Allah, he eats!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd Shaykh\\nAbdullah, the Meccan, being a man of spirit, was amused by the\\nspectacle. \\xef\\xbf\\xbdAre these Afghan manners, Effendim?\\xef\\xbf\\xbd he enquired from the\\nShugduf behind me. \\xef\\xbf\\xbdYes,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd I replied aloud, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdin my country we always dine\\nbefore an attack of robbers, because that gentry is in the habit of\\nsending men to bed supperless.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd The Shaykh laughed aloud, but those\\naround him looked offended. I thought the bravado this time mal place;\\nbut a little event which took place on my way to Jeddah proved that it\\nwas not quite a failure.\\n</p><p>As we advanced, our escort took care to fire every large dry Asclepias,\\nto disperse the shades which buried us. Again the scene became wondrous\\nwild:\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n</p><p>\\xef\\xbf\\xbdFull many a waste I\\xef\\xbf\\xbdve wander\\xef\\xbf\\xbdd o\\xef\\xbf\\xbder,\\nClomb many a crag, cross\\xef\\xbf\\xbdd many a shore,\\nBut, by my halidome,\\nA scene so rude, so wild as this,\\nYet so sublime in barrenness,\\nNe\\xef\\xbf\\xbder did my wandering footsteps press,\\nWhere\\xef\\xbf\\xbder I chanced to roam.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n</p><p>On either side were ribbed precipices, dark, angry, and towering above,\\ntill their summits mingled with the glooms of night; and between them\\nformidable looked the chasm, down which our host hurried with shouts\\nand discharges of matchlocks. The torch-smoke and the night-fires of\\nflaming Asclepias formed a canopy, sable\\n</p><p>[p.146] above and livid red below; it hung over our heads like a sheet,\\nand divided the cliffs into two equal parts. Here the fire flashed\\nfiercely from a tall thorn, that crackled and shot up showers of sparks\\ninto the air; there it died away in lurid gleams, which lit up a truly\\nStygian scene. As usual, however, the picturesque had its\\ninconveniences. There was no path. Rocks, stone-banks, and trees\\nobstructed our passage. The camels, now blind in darkness, then dazzled\\nby a flood of light, stumbled frequently; in some places slipping down\\na steep descent, in others sliding over a sheet of mud. There were\\nfurious quarrels and fierce language between camel-men and their\\nhirers, and threats to fellow-travellers; in fact, we were united in\\ndiscord. I passed that night crying, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdHai! Hai!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd switching the camel, and\\nfruitlessly endeavouring to fustigate Mas\\xef\\xbf\\xbdud\\xef\\xbf\\xbds nephew, who resolutely slept\\nupon the water-bags. During the hours of darkness we made four or five\\nhalts, when we boiled coffee and smoked pipes; but man and beasts were\\nbeginning to suffer from a deadly fatigue.\\n</p><p>Dawn (Saturday, Sept. 10th) found us still travelling down the Fiumara,\\nwhich here is about a hundred yards broad. The granite hills on both\\nsides were less precipitous; and the borders of the torrent-bed became\\nnatural quays of stiff clay, which showed a water-mark of from twelve\\nto fifteen feet in height. In many parts the bed was muddy; and the\\nmoist places, as usual, caused accidents. I happened to be looking back\\nat Shaykh Abdullah, who was then riding in old Ali bin Ya Sin\\xef\\xbf\\xbds fine\\nShugduf; suddenly the camel\\xef\\xbf\\xbds four legs disappeared from under him, his\\nright side flattening the ground, and the two riders were pitched\\nseverally out of the smashed vehicle. Abdullah started up furious, and\\nwith great zest abused the Badawin, who were absent. \\xef\\xbf\\xbdFeed these Arabs,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd he\\nexclaimed, quoting a Turkish proverb, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdand\\n</p><p>[p.147] they will fire at Heaven!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd But I observed that, when Shaykh Mas\\xef\\xbf\\xbdud\\ncame up, the citizen was only gruff.\\n</p><p>We then turned Northward, and sighted Al-Mazik, more generally known as\\nWady Laymun, the Valley of Limes. On the right bank of the Fiumara\\nstood the Meccan Sharif\\xef\\xbf\\xbds state pavilion, green and gold: it was\\nsurrounded by his attendants, and he had prepared to receive the Pasha\\nof the Caravan. We advanced half a mile, and encamped temporarily in a\\nhill-girt bulge of the Fiumara bed. At eight A.M. we had travelled\\nabout twenty-four miles from Al-Zaribah, and the direction of our\\npresent station was South-west 50\\xef\\xbf\\xbd.\\n</p><p>Shaykh Mas\\xef\\xbf\\xbdud allowed us only four hours\\xef\\xbf\\xbd halt; he wished to precede the\\nmain body. After breaking our fast joyously upon limes, pomegranates,\\nand fresh dates, we sallied forth to admire the beauties of the place.\\nWe are once more on classic ground\\xef\\xbf\\xbdthe ground of the ancient Arab poets,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n</p><p>\\xef\\xbf\\xbdDeserted is the village\\xef\\xbf\\xbdwaste the halting place and home\\nAt Mina, o\\xef\\xbf\\xbder Rijam and Ghul wild beasts unheeded roam,\\nOn Rayyan hill the channel lines have left their naked trace,\\nTime-worn, as primal Writ that dints the mountain\\xef\\xbf\\xbds flinty\\n</p>\\n<pre>face;[FN#25]\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n</pre>\\n<p>and this Wady, celebrated for the purity of its air, has from remote\\nages been a favourite resort of the Meccans. Nothing can be more\\nsoothing to the brain than the dark-green foliage of the limes and\\npomegranates; and from\\n</p><p>[p.148] the base of the Southern hill bursts a bubbling stream, whose\\n</p><p>\\xef\\xbf\\xbdChaire, fresche e dolci acque\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n</p><p>flow through the gardens, filling them with the most delicious of\\nmelodies, the gladdest sound which Nature in these regions knows.\\n</p><p>Exactly at noon Mas\\xef\\xbf\\xbdud seized the halter of the foremost camel, and we\\nstarted down the Fiumara. Troops of Badawi girls looked over the\\norchard walls laughingly, and children came out to offer us fresh fruit\\nand sweet water. At two P.M., travelling South-west, we arrived at a\\npoint where the torrent-bed turns to the right[;] and, quitting it, we\\nclimbed with difficulty over a steep ridge of granite. Before three\\no\\xef\\xbf\\xbdclock we entered a hill-girt plain, which my companions called \\xef\\xbf\\xbdSola.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd In\\nsome places were clumps of trees, and scattered villages warned us that\\nwe were approaching a city. Far to the left rose the blue peaks of\\nTaif, and the mountain road, a white thread upon the nearer heights,\\nwas pointed out to me. Here I first saw the tree, or rather shrub,\\nwhich bears the balm of Gilead, erst so celebrated for its tonic and\\nstomachic properties.[FN#26] I told Shaykh Mas\\xef\\xbf\\xbdud to break off a\\n</p><p>[p.149] twig, which he did heedlessly. The act was witnessed by our\\nparty with a roar of laughter; and the astounded Shaykh was warned that\\nhe had become subject to an atoning sacrifice. [FN#27] Of course he\\ndenounced me as the instigator, and I could not fairly refuse\\nassistance. The tree has of late years been carefully described by many\\nbotanists; I will only say that the bark resembled in colour a\\ncherry-stick pipe, the inside was a light yellow, and the juice made my\\nfingers stick together.\\n</p><p>At four P.M. we came to a steep and rocky Pass, up which we toiled with\\ndifficulty. The face of the country was rising once more, and again\\npresented the aspect of numerous small basins divided and surrounded by\\nhills. As we\\n</p><p>[p.150] jogged on we were passed by the cavalcade of no less a\\npersonage than the Sharif of Meccah. Abd al-Muttalib bin Ghalib is a\\ndark, beardless old man with African features derived from his mother.\\nHe was plainly dressed in white garments and a white muslin\\nturband,[FN#28] which made him look jet black; he rode an ambling mule,\\nand the only emblem of his dignity was the large green satin umbrella\\nborn[e] by an attendant on foot.[FN#29] Scattered around him were about\\nforty matchlock men, mostly slaves. At long intervals, after their\\nfather, came his four sons, Riza Bey, Abdullah, Ali, and Ahmad, the\\nlatter still a child. The three elder brothers rode splendid\\ndromedaries at speed; they were young men of light complexion, with the\\ntrue Meccan cast of features, showily dressed in bright coloured silks,\\nand armed, to denote their rank, with sword and gold-hilted\\ndagger.[FN#30]\\n</p><p>[p.151]We halted as evening approached, and strained our eyes, but all\\nin vain, to catch sight of Meccah, which lies in a winding valley. By\\nShaykh Abdullah\\xef\\xbf\\xbds direction I recited, after the usual devotions, the\\nfollowing prayer. The reader is for[e]warned that it is difficult to\\npreserve the flowers of Oriental rhetoric in a European tongue.\\n</p><p>[p.152]O Allah! verily this is Thy Safeguard (Amn) and Thy (Harim)!\\nInto it whoso entereth becometh safe (Amin). So deny (Harrim) my Flesh\\nand Blood, my Bones and Skin, to Hell-fire. O Allah! save me from Thy\\nWrath on the Day when Thy Servants shall be raised from the Dead. I\\nconjure Thee by this that Thou art Allah, besides whom is none (Thou\\nonly), the Merciful, the Compassionate. And have Mercy upon our Lord\\nMohammed, and upon the Progeny of our Lord Mohammed, and upon his\\nFollowers, One and All!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd This was concluded with the \\xef\\xbf\\xbdTalbiyat,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd and with an\\nespecial prayer for myself.\\n</p><p>We again mounted, and night completed our disappointment. About one\\nA.M. I was aroused by general excitement. \\xef\\xbf\\xbdMeccah! Meccah!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd cried some\\nvoices; \\xef\\xbf\\xbdThe Sanctuary! O the Sanctuary!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd exclaimed others; and all burst\\ninto loud \\xef\\xbf\\xbdLabbayk,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd not unfrequently broken by sobs. I looked out from my\\nlitter, and saw by the light of the Southern stars the dim outlines of\\na large city, a shade darker than the surrounding plain. We were\\npassing over the last ridge by a cutting called the Saniyat Kuda\\xef\\xbf\\xbda, the\\nwinding-place of the cut.[FN#31] The \\xef\\xbf\\xbdwinding path\\xef\\xbf\\xbd is flanked on both\\nsides by watch-towers, which command the Darb al-Ma\\xef\\xbf\\xbdala or road leading\\nfrom the North into Meccah. Thence we passed into the Ma\\xef\\xbf\\xbdabidah (Northern\\nsuburb), where the Sharif\\xef\\xbf\\xbds Palace is built.[FN#32] After this, on the\\nleft hand, came\\n</p><p>[p.153] the deserted abode of the Sharif bin Aun, now said to be a\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbdhaunted house.[FN#33]\\xef\\xbf\\xbd Opposite to it lies the Jannat al-Ma\\xef\\xbf\\xbdala, the holy\\ncemetery of Meccah. Thence, turning to the right, we entered the\\nSulaymaniyah or Afghan quarter. Here the boy Mohammed, being an\\ninhabitant of the Shamiyah or Syrian ward, thought proper to display\\nsome apprehension. The two are on bad terms; children never meet\\nwithout exchanging volleys of stones, and men fight furiously with\\nquarterstaves. Sometimes, despite the terrors of religion, the knife\\nand sabre are drawn. But their hostilities have their code. If a\\ncitizen be killed, there is a subscription for blood-money. An\\ninhabitant of one quarter, passing singly through another, becomes a\\nguest; once beyond the walls, he is likely to be beaten to\\ninsensibility by his hospitable foes.\\n</p><p>At the Sulaymaniyah we turned off the main road into a byway, and\\nascended by narrow lanes the rough heights of Jabal Hindi, upon which\\nstands a small whitewashed and crenellated building called a fort.\\nThence descending, we threaded dark streets, in places crowded with\\nrude cots and dusky figures, and finally at two A.M. we found ourselves\\nat the door of the boy Mohammed\\xef\\xbf\\xbds house.\\n</p><p>[p.154]From Wady Laymun to Meccah the distance, according to my\\ncalculation, was about twenty-three miles, the direction South-East\\nforty-five degrees. We arrived on the morning of Sunday, the 7th Zu\\xef\\xbf\\xbdl\\nHijjah (11th September, 1853), and had one day before the beginning of\\nthe pilgrimage to repose and visit the Harim.\\n</p><p>I conclude this chapter with a few remarks upon the watershed of\\nAl-Hijaz. The country, in my humble opinion, has a compound slope,\\nSouthwards and Westwards. I have, however, little but the conviction of\\nthe modern Arabs to support the assertion that this part of Arabia\\ndeclines from the North. All declare the course of water to be\\nSoutherly, and believe the fountain of Arafat to pass underground from\\nBaghdad. The slope, as geographers know, is still a disputed point.\\nRitter, Jomard, and some old Arab authors, make the country rise\\ntowards the south, whilst Wallin and others express an opposite\\nopinion. From the sea to Al-Musahhal is a gentle rise. The water-marks\\nof the Fiumaras show that Al-Madinah is considerably above the coast,\\nthough geographers may not be correct in claiming for Jabal Radhwa a\\nheight of six thousand feet; yet that elevation is not perhaps too\\ngreat for the plateau upon which stands the Apostle\\xef\\xbf\\xbds burial-place. From\\nAl-Madinah to Al-Suwayrkiyah is another gentle rise, and from the\\nlatter to Al-Zaribah stagnating water denotes a level. I believe the\\nreport of a perennial lake on the eastern boundary of Al-Hijaz, as\\nlittle as the river placed by Ptolemy between Yambu\\xef\\xbf\\xbd and Meccah. No\\nBadawi could tell me of this feature, which, had it existed, would have\\nchanged the whole conditions and history of the [p.155] country; we\\nknow the Greek\\xef\\xbf\\xbds river to be a Fiumara, and the lake probably owes its\\nexistence to a similar cause, a heavy fall of rain. Beginning at\\nAl-Zaribah is a decided fall, which continues to the sea. The Arafat\\ntorrent sweeps from East to West with great force, sometimes carrying\\naway the habitations, and even injuring the sanctuary.[FN#34]\\n</p><p>[FN#1] There are certain officers called Zemzemi, who distribute the\\nholy water. In the case of a respectable pilgrim they have a large jar\\nof the shape described in Chap. iv., marked with his names and titles,\\nand sent every morning to his lodgings. If he be generous, one or more\\nwill be placed in the Harim, that men may drink in his honour. The\\nZemzemi expects a present varying from five to eleven dollars.\\n[FN#2] The shishah, smoked on the camel, is a tin canister divided into\\ntwo compartments, the lower half for the water, the upper one for the\\ntobacco. The cover is pierced with holes to feed the fire, and a short\\nhookah-snake projects from one side.\\n[FN#3] The Hindustani \\xef\\xbf\\xbdsir.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd Badawin address it slightingly to Indians,\\nChapter xii.\\n[FN#4] When Indians would say \\xef\\xbf\\xbdhe was killed upon the spot,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd they use the\\npicturesque phrase, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdhe asked not for water.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n[FN#5] The Arabs are curious in and fond of honey: Meccah alone affords\\neight or nine different varieties. The best, and in Arab parlance the\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbdcoldest,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd is the green kind, produced by bees that feed upon a thorny\\nplant called \\xef\\xbf\\xbdsihhah.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd The white and red honeys rank next. The worst is the\\nAsal Asmar (brown honey), which sells for something under a piastre per\\npound. The Abyssinian mead is unknown in Al-Hijaz, but honey enters\\n</p><p>into a variety of dishes.\\n[FN#6] \\xef\\xbf\\xbdLa Siwa Hu,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd i.e., where there is none but Allah.\\n[FN#7] This article, an iron cylinder with bands, mounted on a long\\npole, corresponds with the European cresset of the fifteenth century.\\nThe Pasha\\xef\\xbf\\xbds cressets are known by their smell, a little incense being\\nmingled with the wood. By this means the Badawin discover the dignitary\\xef\\xbf\\xbds\\nplace.\\n[FN#8] \\xef\\xbf\\xbdAbu Sham,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd a familiar address in Al-Hijaz to Syrians. They are\\ncalled \\xef\\xbf\\xbdabusers of the salt,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd from their treachery, and \\xef\\xbf\\xbdoffspring of Shimr\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n(the execrated murderer of the Imam Hosayn), because he was a native of\\nthat country. Such is the detestation in which the Shi\\xef\\xbf\\xbdah sect,\\nespecially the Persians, hold Syria and the Syrians, that I hardly ever\\nmet with a truly religious man who did not desire a general massacre of\\nthe polluted race. And history informs us that the plains of Syria have\\nrepeatedly been drenched with innocent blood shed by sectarian\\nanimosity. Yet Jalal al-Din (History of Jerusalem) says, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdAs to Damascus,\\nall learned men fully agree that it is the most eminent of cities after\\nMeccah and Al-Madinah.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd Hence its many titles, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdthe Smile of the Prophet,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\nthe \\xef\\xbf\\xbdGreat Gate of Pilgrimage,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd \\xef\\xbf\\xbdSham Sharif,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd the \\xef\\xbf\\xbdRight Hand of the Cities of\\nSyria,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd &amp;c., &amp;c. And many sayings of Mohammed in honour of Syria are\\nrecorded. He was fond of using such Syriac words as \\xef\\xbf\\xbdBakhun! Bakhun!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd to\\nAli, and \\xef\\xbf\\xbdKakhun! Kakhun!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd to Hosayn. I will not enter into the curious\\nhistory of the latter word, which spread to Egypt, and, slightly\\naltered, passed through Latin mythology into French, English, German,\\nItalian, and other modern European tongues.\\n[FN#9] There is a regular language to camels. \\xef\\xbf\\xbdIkh! ikh!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd makes them kneel;\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbdYahh! Yahh!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd urges them on; \\xef\\xbf\\xbdHai! Hai!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd induces caution, and so on.\\n[FN#10] Both these names of the Almighty are of kindred origin. The\\nformer is generally used when a woman is in danger of exposing her face\\nby accident, or an animal of falling.\\n[FN#11] A \\xef\\xbf\\xbdbirkat\\xef\\xbf\\xbd in this part of Arabia may be an artificial cistern or a\\nnatural basin; in the latter case it is smaller than a \\xef\\xbf\\xbdghadir.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd This road\\nwas a favourite with Harun al-Rashid, the pious tyrant who boasted that\\nevery year he performed either a pilgrimage or a crusade. The reader\\nwill find in d\\xef\\xbf\\xbdHerbelot an account of the celebrated visit of Harun to\\nthe Holy Cities. Nor less known in Oriental history is the pilgrimage\\nof Zubaydah Khatun (wife of Harun and mother of Amin) by this route.\\n[FN#12] Some believe this literally, others consider it a phrase\\nexpressive of blood-thirstiness. It is the only suspicion of\\ncannibalism, if I may use the word, now attaching to Al-Hijaz. Possibly\\nthe disgusting act may occasionally have taken place after a stern\\nfight of more than usual rancour. Who does not remember the account of\\nthe Turkish officer licking his blood after having sabred the corpse of\\na Russian spy? It is said that the Mutayr and the Utaybah are not\\nallowed to enter Meccah, even during the pilgrimage season.\\n[FN#13] Coloquintida is here used, as in most parts of the East,\\nmedicinally. The pulp and the seeds of the ripe fruit are scooped out,\\nand the rind is filled with milk, which is exposed to the night air,\\nand drunk in the morning.\\n[FN#14] Used in Arabian medicine as a refrigerant and tonic. It abounds\\nin Sind and Afghanistan, where, according to that most practical of\\nbotanists, the lamented Dr. Stocks, it is called \\xef\\xbf\\xbdishwarg.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n[FN#15] Here called Ashr. According to Seetzen it bears the long-sought\\napple of Sodom. Yet, if truth be told, the soft green bag is as unlike\\nan apple as can be imagined; nor is the hard and brittle yellow rind of\\nthe ripe fruit a whit more resembling. The Arabs use the thick and\\nacrid milk of the green bag with steel filings as a tonic, and speak\\nhighly of its effects; they employ it also to intoxicate or narcotise\\nmonkeys and other animals which they wish to catch. It is esteemed in\\nHindu medicine. The Nubians and Indians use the filaments of the fruit\\nas tinder; they become white and shining as floss-silk. The Badawin\\nalso have applied it to a similar purpose. Our Egyptian travellers call\\nit the \\xef\\xbf\\xbdSilk-tree\\xef\\xbf\\xbd; and in Northern Africa, where it abounds, Europeans\\nmake of it stuffing for the mattresses, which are expensive, and highly\\nesteemed for their coolness and cleanliness. In Bengal a kind of gutta\\npercha is made by boiling the juice. This weed, so common in the East,\\nmay one day become in the West an important article of commerce.\\n[FN#16] \\xef\\xbf\\xbdAl-Ihram\\xef\\xbf\\xbd literally meaning \\xef\\xbf\\xbdprohibition\\xef\\xbf\\xbd or \\xef\\xbf\\xbdmaking unlawful,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd equivalent\\nto our \\xef\\xbf\\xbdmortification,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd is applied to the ceremony of the toilette, and\\nalso to the dress itself. The vulgar pronounce the word \\xef\\xbf\\xbdheram,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd or \\xef\\xbf\\xbdl\\xef\\xbf\\xbdehram.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd It\\nis opposed to \\xef\\xbf\\xbdihlal,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd \\xef\\xbf\\xbdmaking lawful\\xef\\xbf\\xbd or \\xef\\xbf\\xbdreturning to laical life.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd The further\\nfrom Meccah it is assumed, provided that it be during the three months\\nof Hajj, the greater is the religious merit of the pilgrim;\\nconsequently some come from India and Egypt in the dangerous attire.\\nThose coming from the North assume the pilgrim-garb at or off the\\nvillage of Rabigh.\\n[FN#17] These sheets are not positively necessary; any clean cotton\\ncloth not sewn in any part will serve equally well. Servants and\\nattendants expect the master to present them with an \\xef\\xbf\\xbdihram.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n[FN#18] Sandals are made at Meccah expressly for the pilgrimage: the\\npoorer classes cut off the upper leathers of an old pair of shoes.\\n[FN#19] This Niyat, as it is technically called, is preferably\\nperformed aloud. Some authorities, however, direct it to be meditated\\nsotto-voce.\\n[FN#20] \\xef\\xbf\\xbdTalbiyat\\xef\\xbf\\xbd is from the word Labbayka (\\xef\\xbf\\xbdhere I am\\xef\\xbf\\xbd) in the cry\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbdLabbayk\\xef\\xbf\\xbd Allahumma, Labbayk\\xef\\xbf\\xbd!\\n(Labbayka) La Sharika laka, Labbayk\\xef\\xbf\\xbd!\\nInna \\xef\\xbf\\xbdl-hamda wa \\xef\\xbf\\xbdl ni\\xef\\xbf\\xbdamata laka wa \\xef\\xbf\\xbdl mulk!\\nLa Sharika laka, Labbayk\\xef\\xbf\\xbd!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\nSome add, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdHere I am, and I honour thee, I the son of thy two slaves:\\nbeneficence and good are all between thy hands.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd A single Talbiyah is a\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbdShart\\xef\\xbf\\xbd or positive condition, and its repetition is a Sunnat or Custom of\\nthe Prophet. The \\xef\\xbf\\xbdTalbiyat\\xef\\xbf\\xbd is allowed in any language, but is preferred in\\nArabic. It has a few varieties; the form above given is the most common.\\n[FN#21] The object of these ordinances is clearly to inculcate the\\nstrictest observance of the \\xef\\xbf\\xbdtruce of God.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd Pilgrims, however, are allowed\\nto slay, if necessary, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdthe five noxious,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd viz., a crow, a kite, a\\nscorpion, a rat, and a biting dog.\\n[FN#22] The victim is sacrificed as a confession that the offender\\ndeems himself worthy of death: the offerer is not allowed to taste any\\nportion of his offering.\\n[FN#23] The reason why this \\xef\\xbf\\xbdugly\\xef\\xbf\\xbd must be worn, is, that a woman\\xef\\xbf\\xbds veil\\nduring the pilgrimage ceremonies is not allowed to touch her face.\\n[FN#24] The Sharifs are born and bred to fighting: the peculiar\\nprivileges of their caste favour their development of pugnacity. Thus,\\nthe modern diyah, or price of blood, being 800 dollars for a common\\nMoslem, the chiefs demand for one of their number double that sum, with\\na sword, a camel, a female slave, and other items; and, if one of their\\nslaves or servants be slain, a fourfold price. The rigorous way in\\nwhich this custom is carried out gives the Sharif and his retainer\\ngreat power among the Arabs. As a general rule, they are at the bottom\\nof all mischief. It was a Sharif (Hosayn bin Ali) who tore down and\\ntrampled upon the British flag at Mocha; a Sharif (Abd al-Rahman of\\nWaht) who murdered Captain Mylne near Lahedge. A page might be filled\\nwith the names of the distinguished ruffians.\\n[FN#25] In these lines of Labid, the \\xef\\xbf\\xbdMina\\xef\\xbf\\xbd alluded to must not, we are\\nwarned by the scholiast, be confounded with \\xef\\xbf\\xbdMina\\xef\\xbf\\xbd (vulg. \\xef\\xbf\\xbdMuna\\xef\\xbf\\xbd), the Valley\\nof Victims. Ghul and Rayyan are hills close to the Wady Laymun. The\\npassage made me suspect that inscriptions would be found among the\\nrocks, as the scholiast informs us that \\xef\\xbf\\xbdmen used to write upon rocks in\\norder that their writing might remain.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd (De Sacy\\xef\\xbf\\xbds Moallaka de Lebid, p.\\n289.) I neither saw nor heard of any. But some months afterwards I was\\ndelighted to hear from the Abbe Hamilton that he had discovered in one\\nof the rock monuments a \\xef\\xbf\\xbdlithographed proof\\xef\\xbf\\xbd of the presence of Sesostris\\n(Rhameses II.).\\n[FN#26] The \\xef\\xbf\\xbdbalsamon\\xef\\xbf\\xbd of Theophrastus and Dioscorides, a corruption of the\\nArabic \\xef\\xbf\\xbdbalisan\\xef\\xbf\\xbd or \\xef\\xbf\\xbdbasham,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd by which name the Badawin know it. In the valley\\nof the Jordan it was worth its weight in silver, and kings warred for\\nwhat is now a weed. Cleopatra by a commission brought it to Egypt. It\\nwas grown at Heliopolis. The last tree died there, we are told by\\nNiebuhr, in the early part of the seventeenth century (according to\\nothers, in A.D. 1502); a circumstance the more curious, as it was used\\nby the Copts in chrisome, and by Europe for anointing kings. From Egypt\\nit was carried to Al-Hijaz, where it now grows wild on sandy and stony\\ngrounds; but I could not discover the date of its naturalisation.\\nMoslems generally believe it to have been presented to Solomon by\\nBilkis, Queen of Sheba. Bruce relates that it was produced at Mohammed\\xef\\xbf\\xbds\\nprayer from the blood of the Badr-Martyr. In the Gospel of Infancy\\n(book i. ch. 8) we read,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\xef\\xbf\\xbd9. Hence they (Joseph and Mary) went out to that\\nsycamore, which is now called Matarea (the modern and Arabic name for\\nHeliopolis). 10. And in Matarea the Lord Jesus caused a well to spring\\nforth, in which St. Mary washed his coat; 11. And a balsam is produced\\nor grows in that country from the sweat which ran down there from the\\nLord Jesus.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd The sycamore is still shown, and the learned recognise in\\nthis ridiculous old legend the \\xef\\xbf\\xbdhiero-sykaminon,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd of pagan Egypt, under\\nwhich Isis and Horus sat. Hence Sir J. Maundeville and an old writer\\nallude reverently to the sovereign virtues of \\xef\\xbf\\xbdbawme.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd I believe its\\nqualities to have been exaggerated, but have found it useful in\\ndressing wounds. Burckhardt (vol. ii. p. 124) alludes to, but appears\\nnot to have seen it. The best balsam is produced upon stony hills like\\nArafat and Muna. In hot weather incisions are made in the bark, and the\\nsoft gum which exudes is collected in bottles. The best kind is of the\\nconsistence of honey, and yellowish-brown, like treacle. It is\\nfrequently adulterated with water, when, if my informant Shaykh\\nAbdullah speak truth, it becomes much lighter in weight. I never heard\\nof the vipers which Pliny mentions as abounding in these trees, and\\nwhich Bruce declares were shown to him alive at Jeddah and at Yambu\\xef\\xbf\\xbd. Dr.\\nCarter found the balm, under the name of Luban Dukah, among the Gara\\ntribe of Eastern Arabia, and botanists have seen it at Aden. We may\\nfairly question its being originally from the banks of the Jordan.\\n[FN#27] This being one of the \\xef\\xbf\\xbdMuharramat,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd or actions forbidden to a\\npilgrim. At all times, say the Moslems, there are three vile trades,\\nviz., those of the Harik al-Hajar (stone-burner), the Kati\\xef\\xbf\\xbd al-Shajar\\n(tree-cutter, without reference to Hawarden, N.B.), and the Bayi\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\nal-Bashar (man-seller, vulg. Jallab).\\n[FN#28] This attire was customary even in Al-Idrisi\\xef\\xbf\\xbds time.\\n[FN#29] From India to Abyssinia the umbrella is the sign of royalty:\\nthe Arabs of Meccah and Sena\\xef\\xbf\\xbda probably derived the custom from the\\nHindus.\\n[FN#30] I purposely omit long descriptions of the Sharif, my\\nfellow-travellers, Messrs. Didier and Hamilton, being far more\\ncompetent to lay the subject before the public. A few political remarks\\nmay not be deemed out of place. The present Sharif, despite his\\ncivilised training at Constantinople, is, and must be a fanatic,\\nbigoted man. He applied for the expulsion of the British Vice-Consul at\\nJeddah, on the grounds that an infidel should not hold position in the\\nHoly Land. His pride and reserve have made him few friends, although\\nthe Meccans, with their enthusiastic nationality, extol his bravery to\\nthe skies, and praise him for conduct as well as for courage. His\\nposition at present is anomalous. Ahmad Pasha of Al-Hijaz rules\\npolitically as representative of the Sultan. The Sharif, who, like the\\nPope, claims temporal as well as spiritual dominion, attempts to\\ncommand the authorities by force of bigotry. The Pasha heads the\\nTurkish, now the ruling party. The Sharif has in his interest the Arabs\\nand the Badawin. Both thwart each other on all possible occasions;\\nquarrels are bitter and endless; there is no government, and the vessel\\nof the State is in danger of being water-logged, in consequence of the\\nsquabbling between her two captains. When I was at Meccah all were in a\\nferment, the Sharif having, it is said, insisted upon the Pasha leaving\\nTaif. The position of the Turks in Al-Hijaz becomes every day more\\ndangerous. Want of money presses upon them, and reduces them to\\ndegrading measures. In February, 1853, the Pasha hired a forced loan\\nfrom the merchants, and but for Mr. Cole\\xef\\xbf\\xbds spirit and firmness, the\\nEnglish proteges would have been compelled to contribute their share.\\nAfter a long and animated discussion, the Pasha yielded the point by\\nimprisoning his recusant subjects, who insisted upon Indians paying,\\nlike themselves. He waited in person with an apology upon Mr. Cole.\\nThough established at Jeddah since 1838, the French and English\\nConsuls, contented with a proxy, never required a return of visit from\\nthe Governor. If the Turks be frequently reduced to such expedients for\\nthe payment of their troops, they will soon be swept from the land. On\\nthe other hand, the Sharif approaches a crisis. His salary, paid by the\\nSultan, may be roughly estimated at \\xef\\xbf\\xbd15,000 per annum. If the Turks\\nmaintain their footing in Arabia, it will probably be found that an\\nhonourable retreat at Stambul is better for the thirty-first descendant\\nof the Prophet than the turbulent life of Meccah; or that a reduced\\nallowance of \\xef\\xbf\\xbd500 per annum would place him in a higher spiritual, though\\nin a lower temporal position. Since the above was written the Sharif\\nAbd al-Muttalib has been deposed. The Arabs of Al-Hijaz united in\\nrevolt against the Sultan, but after a few skirmishes they were reduced\\nto subjection by their old ruler the Sharif bin Aun.\\n[FN#31] Saniyat means a \\xef\\xbf\\xbdwinding path,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd and Kuda\\xef\\xbf\\xbda, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdthe cut.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd Formerly Meccah\\nhad three gates: 1. Bab al-Ma\\xef\\xbf\\xbdala, North-East; 2. Bab al-Umrah, or Bab\\nal-Zahir, on the Jeddah road, West; and 3[.] Bab al-Masfal on the Yaman\\nroad. These were still standing in the twelfth century, but the walls\\nwere destroyed. It is better to enter Meccah by day and on foot; but\\nthis is not a matter of vital consequence in pilgrimage.\\n[FN#32] It is a large whitewashed building, with extensive wooden\\nbalconied windows, but no pretensions to architectural splendour.\\nAround it trees grow, and amongst them I remarked a young cocoa.\\nAl-Idrisi (A.D. 1154) calls the palace Al-Marba\\xef\\xbf\\xbdah.

The Levant Herald states that the presents, which consist, beside the largemoney donation, of rich shawls and gold-woven stuffs, were brought out of the Imperial apartments and packed in presence of the Sultan, on two beautiful camels, which, after the delivery of the usual prayers, were then led in grand procession, accompanied by all the high officers of state, to the landing-place at Cabatash, where the Sure-emini and camels were embarked on a Government steamer and ferried over to Scutari. There the holy functionary will remain some days, till the faithful\\' of the capital and those who have come from the interior have joined him, when the caravan will start for Damascus. At this latter city the grand rendezvous takes place, and, that accomplished, the great caravan sets out for Mecca under the Emir-el-Hadj of the year. The Imperial presents on this occasion cost more than L20,000.\" </span></li><li id=\"cite_note-4\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-4\">\\xe2\\x86\\x91</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">The Syrian Shugduf differs entirely from that of Al-Hijaz. It is composed of two solid wooden cots about four feet in length, slung along the camel\\'s sides and covered over with cloth, in the shape of a tent. They are nearly twice as heavy as the Hijazi litter, and yet a Syrian camel-man would as surely refuse to put one of the latter upon his beast\\'s back, as the Hijazi to carry a Syrian litter.

The word \"Nakah,\" at present popular in Al-Hijaz, means a she-dromedary kept for breeding as well as for riding. </span></li><li id=\"cite_note-6\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-6\">\\xe2\\x86\\x91</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">One might as sensibly cry out \"John\" in an English theatre. </span></li><li id=\"cite_note-7\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-7\">\\xe2\\x86\\x91</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Respectable men in Al-Hijaz, when they meet friends, acquaintances, or superiors, consider it only polite to dismount from a donkey. </span></li><li id=\"cite_note-8\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-8\">\\xe2\\x86\\x91</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">The title of the Pasha who has the privilege of conducting the Caravan. It is a lucrative as well as an honourable employment, for the Emir enjoys the droit d\\'aubaine, becoming heir to the personal property of all pilgrims who die in the Holy Cities or on the line of march. And no Persian, even of the poorest, would think of undertaking a pilgrimage by this line of country, without having at least L80 in ready money with him. The first person who bore the title of Emir Al-Hajj was Abu Bakr, who, in the ninth year of the Hijrah, led 300 Moslems from Al-Madinah to the Meccah pilgrimage. On this occasion idolaters and infidels were for the first time expelled the Holy City. </span></li><li id=\"cite_note-9\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-9\">\\xe2\\x86\\x91</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">\"Harrah\" from Harr (heat) is the generic name of lava, porous basalt, scoriae, greenstone, schiste, and others supposed to be of igneous origin. It is also used to denote a ridge or hill of such formation. One Harrah has already been mentioned in Chapter XV. The second is on the road to Ohod. There is a third Harrah, called Al-Wakin or Al-Zahrah, about one mile Eastward of Al-Madinah. Here the Prophet wept, predicting that the last men of his faith would be foully slain. The prophecy was fulfilled in the days of Yazid, when the people of Al-Madinah filled their assembly with slippers and turbands to show that on account of his abominations they had cast off their allegiance as a garment. The \"Accursed\" sent an aged sinner, Muslim bin Akbah al-Marai, who, though a cripple, defeated the Madani in a battle called the \"Affair of the Ridge,\" slaying of them 10,000 citizens, 1700 learned and great men, 700 teachers of the Koran, and 97 Karashi nobles. This happened in the month of Zu\\'l Hijjah, A.H. 63. For three days the city was plundered, the streets ran blood, dogs ate human flesh in the Mosque, and no fewer than 1000 women were insulted. It was long before Al-Madinah recovered from this fatal blow, which old Muslim declared would open to him the gates of Paradise. The occurrence is now forgotten at Al-Madinah, though it will live in history. The people know not the place, and even the books are doubtful whether this Harrah be not upon the spot where the Khandak or moat was. </span></li><li id=\"cite_note-10\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-10\">\\xe2\\x86\\x91</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"> Meaning that on the Day of Resurrection it shall be so treated. Many, however, suppose Ohod to be one of the four hills of Paradise. The other three, according to Al-Tabrani from Amr bin Auf, are Sinai, Lebanon, and Mount Warkan on the Meccan road. Others suppose Ohod to be one of the six mountains which afforded materials for the Kaabah, viz., Abu Kubays, Sinai, Kuds (at Jerusalem), Warkan and Radhwah near Yambu\\'. Also it is said that when the Lord conversed with Moses on Sinai, the mountain burst into six pieces, three of which flew to Al-Madinah, Ohod, Warkan and Radhwah, and three to Meccah, Hira (now popularly called Jabal Nur), Sabir, (the old name for Jabal Muna), and Saur. </span></li><li id=\"cite_note-11\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-11\">\\xe2\\x86\\x91</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">\"Ayr\" means a \"wild ass,\" whereas Ohod is derived from Ahad, \"one,\"-so called because fated to be the place of victory to those who worship one God. The very names, say Moslem divines, make it abundantly evident that even as the men of Al-Madinah were of two parties, friendly and hostile to the Prophet, so were these mountains. </span></li><li id=\"cite_note-12\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-12\">\\xe2\\x86\\x91</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">This Cave is a Place of Visitation, but I did not go there, as it is on the Northern flank of the hill, and all assured me that it contained nothing worth seeing.

Either, he would argue, you recognise the place of some treasure described in your books, or you are a magician seeking a talisman. </span></li><li id=\"cite_note-16\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-16\">\\xe2\\x86\\x91</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Most Arab authors place Ohod about two miles N. of Al-Madinah. Al-Idrisi calls it the nearest hill, and calculates the distance at 6000 paces. Golius gives two leagues to Ohod and Ayr, which is much too far. In our popular accounts, \"Mohammed posted himself upon the hill of Ohod, about six miles from Al-Madinah,\" two mistakes. </span></li><li id=\"cite_note-17\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-17\">\\xe2\\x86\\x91</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">They are said to be seventy, but the heaps appeared to me at least three times more numerous. </span></li><li id=\"cite_note-18\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-18\">\\xe2\\x86\\x91</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">A Zawiyah in Northern Africa resembles the Takiyah of India, Persia, and Egypt, being a monastery for Darwayshes who reside there singly or in numbers. A Mosque, and sometimes, according to the excellent practice of Al-Islam, a school, are attached to it. </span></li><li id=\"cite_note-19\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-19\">\\xe2\\x86\\x91</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Some historians relate that forty-six years after the battle of Ohod, the tombs were laid bare by a torrent, when the corpses appeared in their winding-sheets as if buried the day before. Some had their hands upon their death wounds, from which fresh blood trickled when the pressure was forcibly removed. In opposition to this Moslem theory, we have that of the modern Greeks, namely, that if the body be notdecomposed within a year, it shows that the soul is not where it should be. </span></li><li id=\"cite_note-20\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-20\">\\xe2\\x86\\x91</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">In fairness I must confess to believing in the reality of these phenomena, but not in their \"spiritual\" origin.</span></li><li id=\"cite_note-21\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-21\">\\xe2\\x86\\x91</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">In Ibn Jubayr\\'s time the tomb was red. </span></li><li id=\"cite_note-22\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-22\">\\xe2\\x86\\x91</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">In the common tombs of martyrs, saints, and holy men, this covering is usually of green cloth, with long white letters sewn upon it. I forgot to ask whether it was temporarily absent from Hamzah\\'s grave. </span></li><li id=\"cite_note-23\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-23\">\\xe2\\x86\\x91</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">All these erections are new. In Burckhardt\\'s time they were mere heaps of earth, with a few loose stones placed around them. I do not know what has become of the third martyr, said to have been interred near Hamzah. Possibly some day he may reappear: meanwhile the people of Al-Madinah are so wealthy in saints, that they can well afford to lose sight of one. </span></li><li id=\"cite_note-24\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-24\">\\xe2\\x86\\x91</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Formerly in this place was shown a slab with the mark of a man\\'s head-like St. Peter\\'s at Rome-where the Prophet had rested. Now it seems to have disappeared, and the tooth has succeeded to itshonours. </span></li><li id=\"cite_note-25\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-25\">\\xe2\\x86\\x91</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"> Some historians say that four teeth were knocked out by this stone. This appears an exaggeration. </span></li><li id=\"cite_note-26\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-26\">\\xe2\\x86\\x91</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"> In Persian characters the word Umr, life, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umar\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"w:Umar\">Umar</a>, the name of the hated caliph, are written in the same way; which explains the pun. </span></li><li id=\"cite_note-27\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-27\">\\xe2\\x86\\x91</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"> That is to say, \"to the hour of death.\" </span></li><li id=\"cite_note-28\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-28\">\\xe2\\x86\\x91</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">When Jubayr bin Mutim was marching to Ohod, according to the Rauzat al-Safa, in revenge for the death of his uncle Taymah, he offered manumission to his slave Wahshi, who was noted for the use of the Abyssinian spear, if he slew Hamzah. The slave sat in ambush behind a rock, and when the hero had despatched one Siba\\'a bin Abd al-Ayiz, of Meccah, he threw a javelin which pierced his navel and came out of his back. The wounded man advanced towards his assassin, who escaped. Hamzah then fell, and his friends coming up, found him dead. Wahshi waited till he saw an opportunity, drew the javelin from the body, and mutilated it, in order to present trophies to the ferocious Hinda (mother of Mu\\'awiyah), whose father Utbah had been slain by Hamzah. The amazon insisted upon seeing the corpse: having presented her necklace and bracelets to Wahshi, she supplied their place with the nose, the ears, and other parts of the dead hero. After mangling the body in a disgusting manner, she ended by tearing open the stomach and biting the liver, whence she was called \"Akkalat al-Akbad.\" When Mohammed saw the state of his father\\'s brother, he was sadly moved. Presently comforted by the inspirations brought by Gabriel, he cried, \"It is written among the people of the seven Heavens, Hamzah, son of Muttalib, is the Lion of Allah, and the Lion of his Prophet,\" and ordered him to be shrouded and prayed over him, beginning, says the Jazb al-Kulub, with seventy repetitions of \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allahu_Akbar\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"w:Allahu Akbar\">Allah Akbar</a>.\" Ali had brought in his shield some water for Mohammed, from a Mahras or stone trough, which stood near the scene of action (M.C. de Perceval translates it \"un creux de rocher formant un bassin naturel\"). But the Prophet refused to drink it, and washed with it the blood from the face of him \"martyred by the side of the Mahras.\" It was of the Moslems slain at Ohod, according to Abu Da\\'ud, that the Prophet declared that their souls should be carried in the crops of green birds, that they might drink of the waters and taste the fruits of Paradise, and nestle beneath the golden lamps that hang from the celestial ceiling. He also forbade, on this occasion, the still popular practice of mutilating an enemy\\'s corpse. </span></li><li id=\"cite_note-29\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-29\">\\xe2\\x86\\x91</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"> The Prophet preferred women and young boys to pray privately, and in some parts of Al-Islam they are not allowed to join a congregation. At Al-Madinah, however, it is no longer, as in Burckhardt\\'s time, \"thought very indecorous in women to enter the Mosque.\" </span></li><li id=\"cite_note-30\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-30\">\\xe2\\x86\\x91</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">I have heard of a Persian being beaten to death, because instead of saying \"Peace be with thee, Ya Omar,\" he insisted upon saying \"Peace be with thee, Ya Humar (O ass!)\" A favourite trick is to change \"Razi Allahu anhu-may Allah be satisfied with him!\"-to \"Razi Allahu Aan.\" This last word is not to be found in Richardson, but any \"Luti\" from Shiraz or Isfahan can make it intelligible to the curious linguist.</span></li></ol>\\n<!-- \\nNewPP limit report\\nParsed by mw1265\\nCached time:

THE FIRST VISIT TO THE HOUSE OF ALLAH.\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\\n<p>THE boy Mohammed left me in the street, and having at last persuaded\\nthe sleepy and tired Indian porter, by violent kicks and testy answers\\nto twenty cautious queries, to swing open the huge gate of his\\nfortress, he rushed up stairs to embrace his mother. After a minute I\\nheard the Zaghritah,[FN#1] Lululu, or shrill cry which in these lands\\nwelcomes the wanderer home; the sound so gladdening to the returner\\nsent a chill to the stranger\\xef\\xbf\\xbds heart.\\n</p><p>Presently the youth returned. His manner had changed from a boisterous\\nand jaunty demeanour to one of grave and attentive courtesy\\xef\\xbf\\xbdI had become\\nhis guest. He led me into the gloomy hall, seated me upon a large\\ncarpeted Mastabah, or platform, and told his bara Miyan[FN#2] (great\\nSir), the Hindustani porter, to bring a light.\\n[p.160] Meanwhile a certain shuffling of slippered feet above informed\\nmy ears that the Kabirah,[FN#3] the mistress of the house, was intent\\non hospitable thoughts. When the camels were unloaded, appeared a dish\\nof fine vermicelli, browned and powdered with loaf sugar. The boy\\nMohammed, I, and Shaykh Nur, lost no time in exerting our right hands;\\nand truly, after our hungry journey, we found the Kunafah delicious.\\nAfter the meal we procured cots from a neighbouring coffee-house, and\\nwe lay down, weary, and anxious to snatch an hour or two of repose. At\\ndawn we were expected to perform our Tawaf al-Kudum, or \\xef\\xbf\\xbdCircumambulation\\nof Arrival,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd at the Harim.\\n</p><p>Scarcely had the first smile of morning beamed upon the rugged head of\\nthe eastern hill, Abu Kubays,[FN#4] when we arose, bathed, and\\nproceeded in our pilgrim-garb to the Sanctuary. We entered by the Bab\\nal-Ziyadah, or principal northern door, descended two long flights of\\nsteps, traversed the cloister, and stood in sight of the Bayt Allah.\\n</p><p>There at last it lay, the bourn of my long and weary Pilgrimage,\\nrealising the plans and hopes of many and many a year. The mirage\\nmedium of Fancy invested the\\n</p><p>[p.161] huge catafalque and its gloomy pall with peculiar charms. There\\nwere no giant fragments of hoar antiquity as in Egypt, no remains of\\ngraceful and harmonious beauty as in Greece and Italy, no barbarous\\ngorgeousness as in the buildings of India; yet the view was strange,\\nunique\\xef\\xbf\\xbdand how few have looked upon the celebrated shrine! I may truly\\nsay that, of all the worshippers who clung weeping to the curtain, or\\nwho pressed their beating hearts to the stone, none felt for the moment\\na deeper emotion than did the Haji from the far-north. It was as if the\\npoetical legends of the Arab spoke truth, and that the waving wings of\\nangels, not the sweet breeze of morning, were agitating and swelling\\nthe black covering of the shrine. But, to confess humbling truth,\\ntheirs was the high feeling of religious enthusiasm, mine was the\\necstasy of gratified pride.\\n</p><p>Few Moslems contemplate for the first time the Ka\\xef\\xbf\\xbdabah, without fear and\\nawe: there is a popular jest against new comers, that they generally\\ninquire the direction of prayer. This being the Kiblah, or fronting\\nplace, Moslems pray all around it; a circumstance which of course\\ncannot take place in any spot of Al-Islam but the Harim. The boy\\nMohammed, therefore, left me for a few minutes to myself; but presently\\nhe warned me that it was time to begin. Advancing, we entered through\\nthe Bab Benu Shaybah, the \\xef\\xbf\\xbdGate of the Sons of the Shaybah[FN#5]\\xef\\xbf\\xbd (old\\nwoman). There we raised our\\n</p><p>[p.162] hands, repeated the Labbayk, the Takbir, and the Tahlil; after\\nwhich we uttered certain supplications, and drew our hands down our\\nfaces. Then we proceeded to the Shafe\\xef\\xbf\\xbdis\\xef\\xbf\\xbd place of worship\\xef\\xbf\\xbdthe open pavement\\nbetween the Makam Ibrahim and the well Zemzem\\xef\\xbf\\xbdwhere we performed the\\nusual two-bow prayer in honour of the Mosque. This was followed by a\\ncup of holy water and a present to the Sakkas, or carriers, who for the\\nconsideration distributed, in my name, a large earthen vaseful to poor\\npilgrims.\\n</p><p>The word Zemzem has a doubtful origin. Some derive it from the Zam Zam,\\nor murmuring of its waters, others from Zam! Zam! (fill! fill! i.e. the\\nbottle), Hagar\\xef\\xbf\\xbds impatient exclamation when she saw the stream. Sale\\ntranslates it stay! stay! and says that Hagar called out in the\\nEgyptian language, to prevent her son wandering. The Hukama, or\\nRationalists of Al-Islam, who invariably connect their faith with the\\nworship of Venus, especially, and the heavenly bodies generally, derive\\nZemzem from the Persian, and make it signify the \\xef\\xbf\\xbdgreat luminary.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd Hence\\nthey say the Zemzem, as well as the Ka\\xef\\xbf\\xbdabah, denoting the Cuthite or\\nAmmonian worship of sun and fire, deserves man\\xef\\xbf\\xbds reverence. So the\\nPersian poet Khakani addresses these two buildings:\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n</p><p>\\xef\\xbf\\xbdO Ka\\xef\\xbf\\xbdabah, thou traveller of the heavens!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbdO Venus, thou fire of the world!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n</p><p>Thus Wahid Mohammed, founder of the Wahidiyah sect, identifies the\\nKiblah and the sun; wherefore he says the door fronts the East. By the\\nnames Yaman (\\xef\\xbf\\xbdright-hand\\xef\\xbf\\xbd), Sham (\\xef\\xbf\\xbdleft-hand\\xef\\xbf\\xbd), Kubul, or the East wind\\n(\\xef\\xbf\\xbdfronting\\xef\\xbf\\xbd), and Dubur, or the West wind (\\xef\\xbf\\xbdfrom the back\\xef\\xbf\\xbd), it is evident that\\nworshippers fronted the rising sun. According to the Hukama, the\\noriginal Black Stone represents Venus, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdwhich in the border of the\\nheavens is a star of the planets,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd and symbolical of the\\n</p><p>[p.163] generative power of nature, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdby whose passive energy the universe\\nwas warmed into life and motion.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd The Hindus accuse the Moslems of\\nadoring the Bayt Ullah.\\n</p><p>\\xef\\xbf\\xbdO Moslem, if thou worship the Ka\\xef\\xbf\\xbdabah,\\nWhy reproach the worshippers of idols?\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n</p><p>says Rai Manshar. And Musaylimah, who in his attempt to found a fresh\\nfaith, gained but the historic epithet of \\xef\\xbf\\xbdLiar,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd allowed his followers to\\nturn their faces in any direction, mentally ejaculating, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdI address\\nmyself to thee, who hast neither side nor figure;\\xef\\xbf\\xbd a doctrine which might\\nbe sensible in the abstract, but certainly not material enough and\\npride-flattering to win him many converts in Arabia.\\n</p><p>The produce of Zemzem is held in great esteem. It is used for drinking\\nand religious ablution, but for no baser purposes; and the Meccans\\nadvise pilgrims always to break their fast with it. It is apt to cause\\ndiarrhoea and boils, and I never saw a stranger drink it without a wry\\nface. Sale is decidedly correct in his assertion: the flavour is a\\nsalt-bitter, much resembling an infusion of a teaspoonful of Epsom\\nsalts in a large tumbler of tepid water. Moreover, it is exceedingly\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbdheavy\\xef\\xbf\\xbd to the digestion. For this reason Turks and other strangers prefer\\nrain-water, collected in cisterns and sold for five farthings a\\ngugglet. It was a favourite amusement with me to watch them whilst they\\ndrank the holy water, and to taunt their scant and irreverent potations.\\n</p><p>The strictures of the Calcutta Review (No. 41, art. 1), based upon the\\ntaste of Zemzem, are unfounded. In these days a critic cannot be\\nexcused for such hasty judgments; at Calcutta or Bombay he would easily\\nfind a jar of Zemzem water, which he might taste for himself. Upon this\\npassage Mr. W. Muir (Life of Mahomet, vol. i, p. cclviii.) remarks that\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbdthe flavour of stale water bottled up for months would not be a\\ncriterion of the same water freshly drawn.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd But it might easily be\\nanalysed.\\n</p><p>The water is transmitted to distant regions in glazed\\n</p><p>[p.164] earthern jars covered with basket-work, and sealed by the\\nZemzemis. Religious men break their lenten fast with it, apply it to\\ntheir eyes to brighten vision, and imbibe a few drops at the hour of\\ndeath, when Satan stands by holding a bowl of purest water, the price\\nof the departing soul. Of course modern superstition is not idle about\\nthe waters of Zemzem. The copious supply of the well is considered at\\nMeccah miraculous; in distant countries it facilitates the\\npron[o]unciation of Arabic to the student; and everywhere the nauseous\\ndraught is highly meritorious in a religious point of view.\\n</p><p>We then advanced towards the eastern angle of the Ka\\xef\\xbf\\xbdabah, in which is\\ninserted the Black Stone; and, standing about ten yards from it,\\nrepeated with upraised hands, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdThere is no god but Allah alone, Whose\\nCovenant is Truth, and Whose Servant is Victorious. There is no god but\\nAllah, without Sharer; His is the Kingdom, to Him be Praise, and He\\nover all Things is potent.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd After which we approached as close as we\\ncould to the stone. A crowd of pilgrims preventing our touching it that\\ntime, we raised our hands to our ears, in the first position of prayer,\\nand then lowering them, exclaimed, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdO Allah (I do this), in Thy Belief,\\nand in verification of Thy Book, and in Pursuance of Thy Prophet\\xef\\xbf\\xbds\\nExample\\xef\\xbf\\xbdmay Allah bless Him and preserve! O Allah, I extend my Hand to\\nThee, and great is my Desire to Thee! O accept Thou my Supplication,\\nand diminish my Obstacles, and pity my Humiliation, and graciously\\ngrant me Thy Pardon!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd After which, as we were still unable to reach the\\nstone, we raised our hands to our ears, the palms facing the stone, as\\nif touching it, recited the various religious formulae, the Takbir, the\\nTahlil, and the Hamdilah, blessed the Prophet, and kissed the\\nfinger-tips of the right hand. The Prophet used to weep when he touched\\nthe Black Stone, and said that it was the place for the pouring forth\\nof tears. According to most authors, the\\n</p><p>[p.165] second Caliph also used to kiss it. For this reason most\\nMoslems, except the Shafe\\xef\\xbf\\xbdi school, must touch the stone with both hands\\nand apply their lips to it, or touch it with the fingers, which should\\nbe kissed, or rub the palms upon it, and afterwards draw them down the\\nface. Under circumstances of difficulty, it is sufficient to stand\\nbefore the stone, but the Prophet\\xef\\xbf\\xbds Sunnat, or practice, was to touch it.\\nLucian mentions adoration of the sun by kissing the hand.\\n</p><p>Then commenced the ceremony of Tawaf,[FN#6] or circumambulation, our\\nroute being the Mataf\\xef\\xbf\\xbdthe low oval of polished granite immediately\\nsurrounding the Ka\\xef\\xbf\\xbdabah. I\\n</p><p>[p.166] repeated, after my Mutawwif, or cicerone,[FN#7] \\xef\\xbf\\xbdIn the Name of\\nAllah, and Allah is omnipotent! I purpose to circuit seven circuits\\nunto Almighty Allah, glorified and exalted!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd This is technically called\\nthe Niyat (intention) of Tawaf. Then we began the prayer, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdO Allah (I do\\nthis), in Thy Belief, and in Verification of Thy Book, and in\\nFaithfulness to Thy Covenant, and in Perseverance of the Example of the\\nApostle Mohammed\\xef\\xbf\\xbdmay Allah bless Him and preserve!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd till we reached the\\nplace Al-Multazem, between the corner of the Black Stone and the Ka\\xef\\xbf\\xbdabah\\ndoor. Here we ejaculated, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdO Allah, Thou hast Rights, so pardon my\\ntransgressing them.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd Opposite the door we repeated, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdO Allah, verily the\\nHouse is Thy House, and the Sanctuary Thy Sanctuary, and the Safeguard\\nThy Safeguard, and this is the Place of him who flies to Thee from\\n(hell) Fire!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd At the little building called Makam Ibrahim we said, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdO\\nAllah, verily this is the Place of Abraham, who took Refuge with and\\nfled to Thee from the Fire!\\xef\\xbf\\xbdO deny my Flesh and Blood, my Skin and Bones\\nto the (eternal) Flames!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd As we paced slowly round the north or Irak\\ncorner of the Ka\\xef\\xbf\\xbdabah we exclaimed, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdO Allah, verily I take Refuge with\\nThee from Polytheism, and Disobedience, and Hypocrisy, and evil\\nConversation, and evil Thoughts concerning Family, and Property, and\\nProgeny!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd When fronting the Mizab, or spout, we repeated the words, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdO\\nAllah, verily I beg of Thee Faith which shall not decline, and a\\nCertainty which shall not perish, and the good Aid of Thy Prophet\\nMohammed\\xef\\xbf\\xbdmay Allah bless Him and preserve! O Allah, shadow me in Thy\\nShadow on that Day when there is no Shade but Thy Shadow, and cause me\\nto drink from the Cup of Thine Apostle Mohammed\\xef\\xbf\\xbdmay Allah bless Him and\\npreserve!\\xef\\xbf\\xbdthat pleasant Draught after which is no Thirst to all Eternity,\\nO Lord of Honour and Glory!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd Turning the\\n</p><p>[p.167] west corner, or the Rukn al-Shami, we exclaimed, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdO Allah, make\\nit an acceptable Pilgrimage, and a Forgiveness of Sins, and a laudable\\nEndeavour, and a pleasant Action (in Thy sight), and a store which\\nperisheth not, O Thou Glorious! O Thou Pardoner!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd This was repeated\\nthrice, till we arrived at the Yamani, or south corner, where, the\\ncrowd being less importunate, we touched the wall with the right hand,\\nafter the example of the Prophet, and kissed the finger-tips. Finally,\\nbetween the south angle and that of the Black Stone, where our circuit\\nwould be completed, we said, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdO Allah, verily I take Refuge with Thee\\nfrom Infidelity, and I take Refuge with Thee from Want, and from the\\nTortures of the Tomb, and from the Troubles of Life and Death. And I\\nfly to Thee from Ignominy in this World and the next, and I implore Thy\\nPardon for the Present and for the Future. O Lord, grant to me in this\\nLife Prosperity, and in the next Life Prosperity, and save me from the\\nPunishment of Fire.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n</p><p>Thus finished a Shaut, or single course round the house. Of these we\\nperformed the first three at the pace called Harwalah, very similar to\\nthe French pas gymnastique, or Tarammul, that is to say, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdmoving the\\nshoulders as if walking in sand.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd The four latter are performed in\\nTa\\xef\\xbf\\xbdammul, slowly and leisurely; the reverse of the Sai, or running. These\\nseven Ashwat, or courses, are called collectively one Usbu ([Arabic]).\\nThe Moslem origin of this custom is too well known to require mention.\\nAfter each Taufah[,] or circuit, we, being unable to kiss or even to\\ntouch the Black Stone, fronted towards it, raised our hands to our\\nears, exclaimed, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdIn the Name of Allah, and Allah is omnipotent!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd kissed\\nour fingers, and resumed the ceremony of circumambulation, as before,\\nwith \\xef\\xbf\\xbdAllah, in Thy Belief,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd &amp;c.\\n</p><p>At the conclusion of the Tawaf it was deemed advisable to attempt to\\nkiss the stone. For a time I stood\\n</p><p>[p.168] looking in despair at the swarming crowd of Badawi and other\\npilgrims that besieged it. But the boy Mohammed was equal to the\\noccasion. During our circuit he had displayed a fiery zeal against\\nheresy and schism, by foully abusing every Persian in his path[FN#8];\\nand the inopportune introduction of hard words into his prayers made\\nthe latter a strange patchwork; as \\xef\\xbf\\xbdAve Maria purissima,\\xef\\xbf\\xbdarrah, dont ye be\\nletting the pig at the pot,\\xef\\xbf\\xbdsanctissima,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd and so forth. He might, for\\ninstance, be repeating \\xef\\xbf\\xbdAnd I take Refuge with Thee from Ignominy in this\\nWorld,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd when \\xef\\xbf\\xbdO thou rejected one, son of the rejected!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd would be the\\ninterpolation addressed to some long-bearded Khorasani,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\xef\\xbf\\xbdAnd in that to come\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\xef\\xbf\\xbdO\\nhog and brother of a hoggess!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd And so he continued till I wondered that\\nnone dared to turn and rend him. After vainly addressing the pilgrims,\\nof whom nothing could be seen but a mosaic of occupits and\\nshoulder-blades, the boy Mohammed collected about half a dozen stalwart\\nMeccans, with whose assistance, by sheer strength, we wedged our way\\ninto the thin and light-legged crowd. The Badawin turned round upon us\\nlike wild-cats, but\\n</p><p>[p.169] they had no daggers. The season being autumn, they had not\\nswelled themselves with milk for six months; and they had become such\\nliving mummies, that I could have managed single-handed half a dozen of\\nthem. After thus reaching the stone, despite popular indignation\\ntestified by impatient shouts, we monopolised the use of it for at\\nleast ten minutes. Whilst kissing it and rubbing hands and forehead\\nupon it I narrowly observed it, and came away persuaded that it is an\\naerolite. It is curious that almost all travellers agree upon one\\npoint, namely, that the stone is volcanic. Ali Bey calls it\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbdmineralogically\\xef\\xbf\\xbd a \\xef\\xbf\\xbdblock of volcanic basalt, whose circumference is\\nsprinkled with little crystals, pointed and straw-like, with rhombs of\\ntile-red feldspath upon a dark background, like velvet or charcoal,\\nexcept one of its protuberances, which is reddish.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd Burckhardt thought it\\nwas \\xef\\xbf\\xbda lava containing several small extraneous particles of a whitish\\nand of a yellowish substance.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n</p><p>Having kissed the stone we fought our way through the crowd to the\\nplace called Al-Multazem. Here we pressed our stomachs, chests, and\\nright cheeks to the Ka\\xef\\xbf\\xbdabah, raising our arms high above our heads and\\nexclaiming, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdO Allah! O Lord of the Ancient House, free my Neck from\\nHell-fire, and preserve me from every ill Deed, and make me contented\\nwith that daily bread which Thou hast given to me, and bless me in all\\nThou hast granted!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd Then came the Istighfar, or begging of pardon; \\xef\\xbf\\xbdI beg\\nPardon of Allah the most high, who, there is no other God but He, the\\nLiving, the Eternal, and unto Him I repent myself!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd After which we\\nblessed the Prophet, and then asked for ourselves all that our souls\\nmost desired.[FN#9]\\n</p><p>[p.170] After embracing the Multazem, we repaired to the Shafe\\xef\\xbf\\xbdis\\xef\\xbf\\xbd place of\\nprayer near the Makam Ibrahim, and there recited two prostrations,\\ntechnically called Sunnat al-Tawaf, or the (Apostle\\xef\\xbf\\xbds) practice of\\ncircumambulation. The chapter repeated in the first was \\xef\\xbf\\xbdSay thou, O\\nInfidels\\xef\\xbf\\xbd: in the second, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdSay thou He is the one God.[FN#10]\\xef\\xbf\\xbd We then went\\nto the door of the building in which is Zemzem: there I was condemned\\nto another nauseous draught, and was deluged with two or three skinfuls\\nof water dashed over my head en douche. This ablution causes sins to\\nfall from the spirit like dust.[FN#11] During the potation we prayed, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdO\\nAllah, verily I beg of Thee plentiful daily Bread, and profitable\\nLearning, and the healing of every Disease!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd Then we returned towards the\\nBlack Stone, stood far away opposite, because unable to touch it,\\nejaculated the Takbir, the Tahlil, and the Hamdilah; and thoroughly\\nworn out with scorched feet and a burning head,\\xef\\xbf\\xbdboth extremities, it must\\nbe remembered, were bare, and various delays had detained us till ten\\nA.M.,\\xef\\xbf\\xbdI left the Mosque.[FN#12]\\n</p><p>The boy Mohammed had miscalculated the amount of lodging in his mother\\xef\\xbf\\xbds\\nhouse. She, being a widow\\n</p><p>[p.171] and a lone woman, had made over for the season all the\\napartments to her brother, a lean old Meccan, of true ancient type,\\nvulture-faced, kite-clawed, with a laugh like a hyena, and a mere shell\\nof body. He regarded me with no favouring eye when I insisted as a\\nguest upon having some place of retirement; but he promised that, after\\nour return from Arafat, a little store-room should be cleared out for\\nme. With that I was obliged to be content, and to pass that day in the\\ncommon male drawing-room of the house, a vestibule on the ground floor,\\ncalled in Egypt a Takhta-bush.[FN#13] Entering, to the left (A) was a\\nlarge Mastabah, or platform, and at the bottom (B) a second, of smaller\\ndimensions and foully dirty. Behind this was a dark and unclean\\nstore-room (C) containing the Hajis\\xef\\xbf\\xbd baggage. Opposite the Mastabah was a\\nfirepan for pipes and coffee (D), superintended by a family of lean\\nIndians; and by the side (E) a doorless passage led to a bathing-room\\n(F) and staircase (G).\\n</p><p>I had scarcely composed myself upon the carpeted Mastabah, when the\\nremainder was suddenly invaded by the Turkish, or rather Slavo-Turk,\\npilgrims inhabiting the house, and a host of their visitors. They were\\nlarge, hairy men, with gruff voices and square figures; they did not\\ntake the least notice of me, although[,] feeling the intrusion, I\\nstretched out my legs with a provoking nonchalance.[FN#14] At last one\\nof them addressed me in Turkish, to which I\\n</p><p>[p.172] replied by shaking my head. His question being interpreted to\\nme in Arabic, I drawled out, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdMy native place is the land of Khorasan.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\nThis provoked a stern and stony stare from the Turks, and an \\xef\\xbf\\xbdugh!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd which\\nsaid plainly enough, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdThen you are a pestilent heretic.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd I surveyed them\\nwith a self-satisfied simper, stretched my legs a trifle farther, and\\nconversed with my water-pipe. Presently, when they all departed for a\\ntime, the boy Mohammed raised, by request, my green box of medicines,\\nand deposited it upon the Mastabah; thus defining, as it were, a line\\nof demarcation, and asserting my privilege to it before the Turks. Most\\nof these men were of one party, headed by a colonel of Nizam, whom they\\ncalled a Bey. My acquaintance with them began roughly enough, but\\nafterwards, with some exceptions, who were gruff as an English butcher\\nwhen accosted by a lean foreigner, they proved to be kind-hearted and\\nnot unsociable men. It often happens to the traveller, as the charming\\nMrs. Malaprop observes, to find intercourse all the better by beginning\\nwith a little aversion.\\n</p><p>In the evening, accompanied by the boy Mohammed, and followed by Shaykh\\nNur, who carried a lantern and a praying-rug, I again repaired to the\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbdNavel of the World[FN#15]; this time aesthetically, to enjoy the\\ndelights of the hour after the \\xef\\xbf\\xbdgaudy, babbling, and remorseful day.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd The\\nmoon, now approaching the full, tipped the brow of Abu Kubays, and lit\\nup the spectacle with a more solemn light. In the midst stood the huge\\nbier-like erection,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n</p><p>\\xef\\xbf\\xbdBlack as the wings\\nWhich some spirit of ill o\\xef\\xbf\\xbder a sepulchre flings,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n</p><p>[p.173] except where the moonbeams streaked it like jets of silver\\nfalling upon the darkest marble. It formed the point of rest for the\\neye; the little pagoda-like buildings and domes around it, with all\\ntheir gilding and fretwork, vanished. One object, unique in appearance,\\nstood in view\\xef\\xbf\\xbdthe temple of the one Allah, the God of Abraham, of\\nIshmael, and of their posterity. Sublime it was, and expressing by all\\nthe eloquence of fancy the grandeur of the One Idea which vitalised\\nAl-Islam, and the strength and steadfastness of its votaries.\\n</p><p>The oval pavement round the Ka\\xef\\xbf\\xbdabah was crowded with men, women, and\\nchildren, mostly divided into parties, which followed a Mutawwif; some\\nwalking staidly, and others running, whilst many stood in groups to\\nprayer. What a scene of contrasts! Here stalked the Badawi woman, in\\nher long black robe like a nun\\xef\\xbf\\xbds serge, and poppy-coloured face-veil,\\npierced to show two fiercely flashing orbs. There an Indian woman, with\\nher semi-Tartar features, nakedly hideous, and her thin legs, encased\\nin wrinkled tights, hurried round the fane. Every now and then a\\ncorpse, borne upon its wooden shell, circuited the shrine by means of\\nfour bearers, whom other Moslems, as is the custom, occasionally\\nrelieved. A few fair-skinned Turks lounged about, looking cold and\\nrepulsive, as their wont is. In one place a fast Calcutta Khitmugar\\nstood, with turband awry and arms akimbo, contemplating the view\\njauntily, as those \\xef\\xbf\\xbdgentlemen\\xef\\xbf\\xbds gentlemen\\xef\\xbf\\xbd will do. In another, some poor\\nwretch, with arms thrown on high, so that every part of his person\\nmight touch the Ka\\xef\\xbf\\xbdabah, was clinging to the curtain and sobbing as\\nthough his heart would break.\\n</p><p>From this spectacle my eyes turned towards Abu Kubays. The city extends\\nin that direction half-way up the grim hill: the site might be\\ncompared, at a humble distance, to Bath. Some writers liken it to\\nFlorence; but conceive a Florence without beauty! To the South\\n</p><p>[p.174] lay Jabal Jiyad the Greater,[FN#16] also partly built over and\\ncrowned with a fort, which at a distance looks less useful than\\nromantic[FN#17]: a flood of pale light was sparkling upon its stony\\nsurface. Below, the minarets became pillars of silver, and the\\ncloisters, dimly streaked by oil lamps, bounded the views of the temple\\nwith horizontal lines of shade.\\n</p><p>Before nightfall the boy Mohammed rose to feed the Mosque pigeons, for\\nwhom he had brought a pocketful of barley. He went to the place where\\nthese birds flock\\xef\\xbf\\xbdthe line of pavement leading from the isolated arch to\\nthe Eastern cloisters. During the day women and children are to be seen\\nsitting here, with small piles of grain upon little plaited trays of\\nbasket-work. For each they demand a copper piece; and religious\\npilgrims consider it their duty to provide the reverend blue-rocks with\\na plentiful meal.\\n</p><p>The Hindu Pandits assert that Shiwa and his spouse, under the forms and\\nnames of Kapot-Eshwara (pigeon god) and Kapotesi, dwelt at Meccah. The\\ndove was the device of the old Assyrian Empire, because it is supposed\\nSemiramis was preserved by that bird. The Meccan pigeons, resembling\\nthose of Venice, are held sacred probably in consequence of the wild\\ntraditions of the Arabs about Noah\\xef\\xbf\\xbds dove. Some authors declare that in\\nMohammed\\xef\\xbf\\xbds time, among the idols of the Meccan Pantheon, was a pigeon\\ncarved in wood, and above it another, which Ali, mounting upon the\\nProphet\\xef\\xbf\\xbds shoulder, pulled down. This might have been a Hindu, a Jewish,\\nor a Christian symbol. The Moslems connect the pigeon\\n</p><p>[p.175] on two occasions with their faith: first, when that bird\\nappeared to whisper in Mohammed\\xef\\xbf\\xbds ear; and, secondly, during the flight\\nto Al-Madinah. Moreover, in many countries they are called \\xef\\xbf\\xbdAllah\\xef\\xbf\\xbds\\nProclaimers,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd because their movement when cooing resembles prostration.\\n</p><p>Almost everywhere the pigeon has entered into the history of religion,\\nwhich probably induced Mr. Lascelles to incur the derision of our\\ngrandfathers by pronouncing it a \\xef\\xbf\\xbdholy bird.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd At Meccah they are called the\\ndoves of the Ka\\xef\\xbf\\xbdabah, and they never appear at table. They are remarkable\\nfor propriety when sitting upon the holy building. This may be a minor\\nmiracle: I would rather believe that there is some contrivance on the\\nroof. My friend Mr. Bicknell remarks: \\xef\\xbf\\xbdThis marvel, however, having of\\nlate years been suspended, many discern another omen of the approach of\\nthe long-predicted period when unbelievers shall desecrate the sacred\\nsoil.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n</p><p>Late in the evening I saw a negro in the state called Malbus\\xef\\xbf\\xbdreligious\\nfrenzy. To all appearance a Takruri, he was a fine and a powerful man,\\nas the numbers required to hold him testified. He threw his arms wildly\\nabout him, uttering shrill cries, which sounded like le le le le! and\\nwhen held, he swayed his body, and waved his head from side to side,\\nlike a chained and furious elephant, straining out the deepest groans.\\nThe Africans appear unusually subject to this nervous state which, seen\\nby the ignorant and the imaginative, would at once suggest \\xef\\xbf\\xbddemoniacal\\npossession.[FN#18]\\xef\\xbf\\xbd Either their organisation is more impressionable, or\\nmore probably, the hardships, privations, and fatigues endured whilst\\nwearily traversing inhospitable wilds, and perilous seas, have exalted\\ntheir\\n</p><p>[p.176] imaginations to a pitch bordering upon frenzy. Often they are\\nseen prostrate on the pavement, or clinging to the curtain, or rubbing\\ntheir foreheads upon the stones, weeping bitterly, and pouring forth\\nthe wildest ejaculations.\\n</p><p>That night I stayed in the Harim till two A.M., wishing to see if it\\nwould be empty. But the morrow was to witness the egress to Arafat;\\nmany, therefore, passed the hours of darkness in the Harim. Numerous\\nparties of pilgrims sat upon their rugs, with lanterns in front of\\nthem, conversing, praying, and contemplating the Ka\\xef\\xbf\\xbdabah. The cloisters\\nwere full of merchants, who resorted there to \\xef\\xbf\\xbdtalk shop,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd and to vend such\\nholy goods as combs, tooth-sticks, and rosaries. Before ten P.M. I\\nfound no opportunity of praying the usual two prostrations over the\\ngrave of Ishmael. After waiting long and patiently, at last I was\\nstepping into the vacant place, when another pilgrim rushed forward;\\nthe boy Mohammed, assisted by me, instantly seized him, and, despite\\nhis cries and struggles, taught him to wait. Till midnight we sat\\nchatting with the different ciceroni who came up to offer their\\nservices. I could not help remarking their shabby and dirty clothes,\\nand was informed that during pilgrimage, when splendour is liable to be\\nspoiled, they wear out old dresses; and appear endimanches for the\\nMuharram fete, when most travellers have left the city. Presently my\\ntwo companions, exhausted with fatigue, fell asleep; I went up to the\\nKa\\xef\\xbf\\xbdabah, with the intention of \\xef\\xbf\\xbdannexing\\xef\\xbf\\xbd a bit of the torn old Kiswat or\\ncurtain, but too many eyes were looking on. At this season of the year\\nthe Kiswat is much tattered at the base, partly by pilgrims\\xef\\xbf\\xbd fingers, and\\npartly by the strain of the cord which confines it when the wind is\\nblowing. It is considered a mere peccadillo to purloin a bit of the\\nvenerable stuff; but as the officers of the temple make money by\\nselling it, they certainly would visit detection with an\\n</p>\\n<pre>[p.177] unmerciful application of the quarterstaff. The piece in my\\n</pre>\\n<p>possession was given to me by the boy Mohammed before I left Meccah.\\nWaistcoats cut out of the Kiswah still make the combatants invulnerable\\nin battle, and are considered presents fit for princes. The Moslems\\ngenerally try to secure a strip of this cloth as a mark for the Koran,\\nor for some such purpose. The opportunity, however, was favourable for\\na survey, and with a piece of tape, and the simple processes of\\nstepping and spanning, I managed to measure all the objects concerning\\nwhich I was curious.\\n</p><p>At last sleep began to weigh heavily upon my eyelids. I awoke my\\ncompanions, and in the dizziness of slumber they walked with me through\\nthe tall narrow street from the Bab al-Ziyadah to our home in the\\nShamiyah. The brilliant moonshine prevented our complaining, as other\\ntravellers have had reason to do, of the darkness and the difficulty of\\nMeccah\\xef\\xbf\\xbds streets. The town, too, appeared safe; there were no watchmen,\\nand yet people slept everywhere upon cots placed opposite their open\\ndoors. Arrived at the house, we made some brief preparations for\\nsnatching a few hours\\xef\\xbf\\xbd sleep upon the Mastabah, a place so stifling, that\\nnothing but utter exhaustion could induce lethargy there.\\n</p><p>[FN#1] The Egyptian word is generally pronounced \\xef\\xbf\\xbdZaghrutah,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd the plural is\\nZagharit, corrupted to Ziraleet. The classical Arabic term is \\xef\\xbf\\xbdTahlil\\xef\\xbf\\xbd; the\\nPersians call the cry \\xef\\xbf\\xbdKil.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd It is peculiar to women, and is formed by\\nraising the voice to its highest pitch, vibrating it at the same time\\nby rolling the tongue, whose modulations express now joy, now grief. To\\nmy ear it always resembled the brain-piercing notes of a fife. Dr.\\nBuchanan likens it to a serpent uttering human sounds. The \\xef\\xbf\\xbdunsavoury\\ncomparison,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd however, may owe its origin to the circumstance that Dr.\\nBuchanan heard it at the orgies of Jagannath.\\n[FN#2] As an Indian is called \\xef\\xbf\\xbdMiyan,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd sir, an elderly Indian becomes \\xef\\xbf\\xbdbara\\nMiyan,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd great or ancient sir. I shall have occasion to speak at a future\\nperiod of these Indians at Meccah.\\n[FN#3] \\xef\\xbf\\xbdSitt al-Kabirah,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd or simply \\xef\\xbf\\xbdAl-Kabirah,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd the Great Lady, is the title\\ngiven to the mistress of. the house.\\n[FN#4] This hill bounds Meccah on the East. According to many Moslems,\\nAdam, with his wife and his son Seth, lie buried in a cave here. Others\\nplace his tomb at Muna; the Majority at Najaf. The early Christians had\\na tradition that our first parents were interred under Mount Calvary;\\nthe Jews place their grave near Hebron. Habil (Abel), it is well known,\\nis supposed to be entombed at Damascus; and Kabil (Cain) rests at last\\nunder Jabal Shamsan, the highest wall of the Aden crater, where he and\\nhis progeny, tempted by Iblis, erected the first fire-temple. It\\ncertainly deserves to be the sepulchre of the first murderer. The\\nworship, however, was probably imported from India, where Agni (the\\nfire god) was, as the Vedas prove, the object of man\\xef\\xbf\\xbds earliest adoration.\\n[FN#5] The popular legend of this gate is, that when Abraham and his\\nson were ordered to rebuild the Ka\\xef\\xbf\\xbdabah, they found the spot occupied by\\nan old woman. She consented to remove her house on condition that the\\nkey of the new temple should be entrusted to her and to her descendants\\nfor ever and ever. The origin of this is, that Benu Shaybah means the\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbdsons of an old woman\\xef\\xbf\\xbd as well as \\xef\\xbf\\xbddescendants of Shaybah.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd And history tells\\nus that the Benu Shaybah are derived from one Shaybah (bin Osman, bin\\nTalhah, bin Shaybah, bin Talhah, bin Abd al-Dar), who was sent by\\nMu\\xef\\xbf\\xbdawiyah to make some alterations in the Ka\\xef\\xbf\\xbdabah. According to others, the\\nKa\\xef\\xbf\\xbdabah key was committed to the charge of Osman bin Talhah by the\\nProphet.\\n[FN#6] The Moslem in circumambulation presents his left shoulder; the\\nHindu\\xef\\xbf\\xbds Pradakshina consists in walking round with the right side towards\\nthe fane or idol. Possibly the former may be a modification of the\\nlatter, which would appear to be the original form of the rite. Its\\nconjectural significance is an imitation of the procession of the\\nheavenly bodies, the motions of the spheres, and the dances of the\\nangels. These are also imitated in the circular whirlings of the\\nDarwayshes. And Al-Shahristani informs us that the Arab philosophers\\nbelieved this sevenfold circumambulation to be symbolical of the motion\\nof the planets round the sun. It was adopted by the Greeks and Romans,\\nwhose Ambarvalia and Amburbalia appear to be eastern superstitions,\\nintroduced by Numa, or by the priestly line of princes, into their\\npantheism. And our processions round the parish preserve the form of\\nthe ancient rites, whose life is long since fled. Moslem moralists have\\nnot failed to draw spiritual food from this mass of materialism. \\xef\\xbf\\xbdTo\\ncircuit the Bayt Ullah,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd said the Pir Raukhan (As. Soc. vol. xi. and\\nDabistan, vol. iii., \\xef\\xbf\\xbdMiyan Bayazid\\xef\\xbf\\xbd), \\xef\\xbf\\xbdand to be free from wickedness, and\\ncrime, and quarrels, is the duty enjoined by religion. But to circuit\\nthe house of the friend of Allah (i.e. the heart), to combat bodily\\npropensities, and to worship the Angels, is the business of the\\n(mystic) path.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd Thus Sa\\xef\\xbf\\xbdadi, in his sermons,\\xef\\xbf\\xbdwhich remind the Englishman of\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbdpoor Yorick,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\xef\\xbf\\xbdHe who travels to the Ka\\xef\\xbf\\xbdabah on foot makes a circuit of the\\nKa\\xef\\xbf\\xbdabah, but he who performs the pilgrimage of the Ka\\xef\\xbf\\xbdabah in his heart is\\nencircled by the Ka\\xef\\xbf\\xbdabah.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd And the greatest Moslem divines sanction this\\nvisible representation of an invisible and heavenly shrine, by\\ndeclaring that, without a material medium, it is impossible for man to\\nworship the Eternal Spirit.\\n[FN#7] The Mutawwif, or Dalil, is the guide at Meccah.\\n[FN#8] In A.D. 1674 some wretch smeared the Black Stone with impurity,\\nand every one who kissed it retired with a sullied beard. The Persians,\\nsays Burckhardt, were suspected of this sacrilege, and now their\\nill-fame has spread far; at Alexandria they were described to me as a\\npeople who defile the Ka\\xef\\xbf\\xbdabah. It is scarcely necessary to say that a\\nShi\\xef\\xbf\\xbdah, as well as a Sunni, would look upon such an action with lively\\nhorror. The people of Meccah, however, like the Madani, have turned the\\ncircumstance to their own advantage, and make an occasional \\xef\\xbf\\xbdavanie.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd Thus,\\nnine or ten years ago, on the testimony of a boy who swore that he saw\\nthe inside of the Ka\\xef\\xbf\\xbdabah defiled by a Persian, they rose up, cruelly\\nbeat the schismatics, and carried them off to their peculiar quarter\\nthe Shamiyah, forbidding their ingress to the Ka\\xef\\xbf\\xbdabah. Indeed, till\\nMohammed Ali\\xef\\xbf\\xbds time, the Persians rarely ventured upon a pilgrimage, and\\neven now that man is happy who gets over it without a beating. The\\ndefilement of the Black Stone was probably the work of some Jew or\\nGreek, who risked his life to gratify a furious bigotry.\\n[FN#9] Prayer is granted at fourteen places besides Al-Multazem, viz.:\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n</p><p>1.  At the place of circumambulation.\\n2.  Under the Mizab, or spout of the Ka\\xef\\xbf\\xbdabah.\\n3.  Inside the Ka\\xef\\xbf\\xbdabah.\\n4.  At the well Zemzem.\\n5.

At Muzdalifah.\\n11. In Muna.\\n12. During the devil-stoning.\\n13. On first seeing the Ka\\xef\\xbf\\xbdabah.\\n14. At the Hatim or Hijr.\\n[FN#10] The former is the 109th, the latter the 112th chapter of the\\nKoran (I have translated it in a previous volume).\\n[FN#11] These superstitions, I must remark, belong only to the vulgar.\\n[FN#12] Strictly speaking we ought, after this, to have performed the\\nceremony called Al-Sai, or the running seven times between Mounts Safa\\nand Marwah. Fatigue put this fresh trial completely out of the question.\\n[FN#13] I have been diffuse in my description of this vestibule, as it\\nis the general way of laying out a ground-floor at Meccah. During the\\npilgrimage time the lower hall is usually converted into a shop for the\\ndisplay of goods, especially when situated in a populous quarter.\\n[FN#14] This is equivalent to throwing oneself upon the sofa in Europe.\\nOnly in the East it asserts a decided claim to superiority; the West\\nwould scarcely view it in that light.\\n[FN#15] Ibn Haukal begins his cosmography with Meccah \\xef\\xbf\\xbdbecause the temple\\nof the Lord is situated there, and the holy Ka\\xef\\xbf\\xbdabah is the navel of the\\nearth, and Meccah is styled in sacred writ the parent city, or the\\nmother of towns.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd Unfortunately, Ibn Haukal, like most other Moslem\\ntravellers and geographers, says no more about Meccah.\\n[FN#16] To distinguish it from the Jiyad (above the cemetery Al-Ma\\xef\\xbf\\xbdala)\\nover which Khalid entered Meccah.

Our delay arose from the tyrannical conduct of the boy\\nMohammed, who insisted upon leaving his little nephew behind. It was\\nlong before he yielded. I then placed the poor child, who was crying\\nbitterly, in the litter between us, and at last we started.\\n</p><p>We followed the road by which the Caravans entered Meccah. It was\\ncovered with white-robed pilgrims, some few wending their way on\\nfoot[FN#1]; others riding, and all men barefooted and bareheaded. Most\\nof the wealthier classes mounted asses. The scene was, as usual, one of\\nstrange contrasts: Badawin bestriding swift dromedaries; Turkish\\ndignitaries on fine horses; the most picturesque beggars, and the most\\nuninteresting Nizam. Not a little wrangling mingled with the loud\\nbursts of Talbiyat. Dead animals dotted the ground, and carcasses had\\nbeen cast into a dry tank, the Birkat al-Shami which caused every\\nBadawi to\\n</p><p>[p.179] hold his nose.[FN#2] Here, on the right of the road, the poorer\\npilgrims, who could not find houses, had erected huts, and pitched\\ntheir ragged tents. Traversing the suburb Al-Ma\\xef\\xbf\\xbdb\\xef\\xbf\\xbddah (Ma\\xef\\xbf\\xbdabadah), in a\\nvalley between the two barren prolongations of Kayka\\xef\\xbf\\xbdan and Khandamah, we\\nturned to the north-east, leaving on the left certain barracks of\\nTurkish soldiery, and the negro militia here stationed, with the\\nSaniyat Kuda\\xef\\xbf\\xbda in the background. Then, advancing about 3000 paces over\\nrising ground, we passed by the conical head of Jabal Nur,[FN#3] and\\nentered the plain of many names.[FN#4] It contained nothing but a few\\nwhitewashed walls, surrounding places of prayer, and a number of stone\\ncisterns, some well preserved, others in ruins. All, however, were dry,\\nand water-vendors crowded the roadside. Gravel and lumps of granite\\ngrew there like grass, and from under every large stone, as Shaykh Mas\\xef\\xbf\\xbdud\\ntook a delight in showing, a small scorpion, with tail curled over its\\nback, fled, Parthian-like, from the invaders of its home. At eleven\\nA.M., ascending a Mudarraj, or flight of stone steps, about thirty\\nyards broad, we passed without difficulty, for we were in advance of\\nthe caravans, over the Akabah, or Steeps,[FN#5] and the narrow,\\nhill-girt entrance, to the low gravel basin in which Muna lies.\\n</p><p><br />\\n[p.180] Muna, more classically called Mina,[FN#6] is a place of\\nconsiderable sanctity. Its three standing miracles are these: The\\npebbles thrown at \\xef\\xbf\\xbdthe Devil\\xef\\xbf\\xbd return by angelic agency to whence they came;\\nduring the three Days of Drying Meat rapacious beasts and birds cannot\\nprey there; and, lastly, flies do not settle upon the articles of food\\nexposed so abundantly in the bazars.[FN#7] During pilgrimage, houses\\nare let for an exorbitant sum, and it becomes a \\xef\\xbf\\xbdWorld\\xef\\xbf\\xbds Fair\\xef\\xbf\\xbd of Moslem\\nmerchants. At all other seasons it is almost deserted, in consequence,\\nsays popular superstition, of the Rajm or (diabolical)\\nlapidation.[FN#8] Distant about three miles from Meccah, it is a long,\\nnarrow, straggling village, composed of mud and stone houses of one or\\ntwo stories, built in the common Arab style. Traversing a narrow\\nstreet, we passed on the left the Great Devil, which shall be described\\nat a future time. After a quarter of an hour\\xef\\xbf\\xbds halt, spent over pipes and\\ncoffee, we came to an open space, where stands the Mosque \\xef\\xbf\\xbdAl-Khayf.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd Here,\\naccording to some Arabs, Adam lies, his head being at one end of one\\nlong wall, and his feet at another, whilst the dome covers his omphalic\\nregion. Grand preparations for fireworks were being made in this\\nsquare; I especially remarked a fire-ship,\\n</p><p>[p.181] which savoured strongly of Stambul. After passing through the\\ntown, we came to Batn al-Muhassir, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdThe Basin of the Troubler,[FN#9]\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n(Satan) at the beginning of a descent leading to Muzdalifah (the\\nApproacher), where the road falls into the valley of the Arafat torrent.\\n</p><p>At noon we reached the Muzdalifah, also called Mashar al-Haram, the\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbdPlace dedicated to religious Ceremonies.[FN#10]\\xef\\xbf\\xbd It is known in Al-Islam\\nas \\xef\\xbf\\xbdthe Minaret without the Mosque,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd opposed to Masjid Nimrah, which is the\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbdMosque without the Minaret.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd Half-way between Muna and Arafat, it is about\\nthree miles from both. There is something peculiarly striking in the\\ndistant appearance of the tall, solitary tower, rising abruptly from\\nthe desolate valley of gravel, flanked with buttresses of yellow rock.\\nNo wonder that the ancient Arabs loved to give the high-sounding name\\nof this oratory to distant places in their giant Caliph-empire.\\n</p><p>Here as we halted to perform the mid-day prayer, we were overtaken by\\nthe Damascus Caravan. It was a grand spectacle. The Mahmil, no longer\\nnaked as upon the line of march, flashed in the sun all green and gold.\\nAround the moving host of white-robed pilgrims hovered a crowd of\\nBadawin, male and female, all mounted on swift dromedaries, and many of\\nthem armed to the teeth. As their drapery floated in the wind, and\\ntheir faces were veiled with the \\xef\\xbf\\xbdLisam,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd it was frequently difficult to\\n</p><p>[p.182] distinguish the sex of the wild being, flogging its animal to\\nspeed. These people, as has been said, often resort to Arafat for\\nblood-revenge, in hopes of finding the victim unprepared. Nothing can\\nbe more sinful in Al-Islam than such deed\\xef\\xbf\\xbdit is murder, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdmade sicker\\xef\\xbf\\xbd by\\nsacrilege; yet the prevalence of the practice proves how feeble is the\\nreligion\\xef\\xbf\\xbds hold upon the race. The women are as unscrupulous: I remarked\\nmany of them emulating the men in reckless riding, and striking with\\ntheir sticks every animal in the way.\\n</p><p>Travelling Eastward up the Arafat Fiumara, after about half an hour we\\ncame to a narrow pass called Al-Akhshabayn[FN#11] or the \\xef\\xbf\\xbdTwo Rugged\\nHills.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd Here the spurs of the rock limited the road to about a hundred\\npaces, and it is generally a scene of great confusion. After this we\\narrived at Al-Bazan (the Basin),[FN#12] a widening of the plain; and\\nanother half-hour brought us to the Alamayn (the \\xef\\xbf\\xbdTwo Signs\\xef\\xbf\\xbd), whitewashed\\npillars, or rather thin, narrow walls, surmounted with pinnacles, which\\ndenote the precincts of the Arafat plain. Here, in full sight of the\\nHoly Hill, standing boldly out from the deep blue sky, the host of\\npilgrims broke into loud Labbayks. A little beyond, and to our right,\\nwas the simple enclosure called the Masjid Nimrah.[FN#13] We then\\n</p><p>[p.183] turned from our eastern course northwards, and began threading\\nour way down the main street of the town of tents which clustered about\\nthe southern foot of Arafat. At last, about three P.M., we found a\\nvacant space near the Matbakh, or kitchen, formerly belonging to a\\nSharif\\xef\\xbf\\xbds palace, but now a ruin with a few shells of arches.\\n</p><p>Arafat is about six hours\\xef\\xbf\\xbd very slow march, or twelve miles,[FN#14] on\\nthe Taif road, due east of Meccah. We arrived there in a shorter time,\\nbut our weary camels, during the last third of the way, frequently\\nthrew themselves upon the ground. Human beings suffered more. Between\\nMuna and Arafat I saw no fewer than five men fall down and die upon the\\nhighway: exhausted and moribund, they had dragged themselves out to\\ngive up the ghost where it departs to instant beatitude.[FN#15] The\\nspectacle showed how easy it is to die in these latitudes[FN#16]; each\\nman suddenly staggered, fell as if shot; and, after a brief convulsion,\\nlay still as marble. The corpses were carefully taken up, and\\ncarelessly buried that same evening, in a vacant space amongst the\\ncrowds encamped upon the Arafat plain.[FN#17]\\n</p><p>The boy Mohammed, who had long chafed at my pertinacious\\n[p.184] claim to Darwaysh-hood, resolved on this occasion to be grand.\\nTo swell the party he had invited Omar Effendi, whom we accidentally\\nmet in the streets of Meccah, to join us[;] but failing therein, he\\nbrought with him two cousins, fat youths of sixteen and seventeen, and\\nhis mother\\xef\\xbf\\xbds ground-floor servants. These were four Indians: an old man;\\nhis wife, a middle-aged woman of the most ordinary appearance; their\\nson, a sharp boy, who spoke excellent Arabic[FN#18]; and a family\\nfriend, a stout fellow about thirty years old. They were Panjabis, and\\nthe bachelor\\xef\\xbf\\xbds history was instructive. He was gaining an honest\\nlivelihood in his own country, when suddenly one night Hazrat Ali,\\ndressed in green, and mounted upon his charger Duldul[FN#19]\\xef\\xbf\\xbdat least, so\\nsaid the narrator\\xef\\xbf\\xbdappeared, crying in a terrible voice, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdHow long wilt thou\\ntoil for this world, and be idle about the life to come?\\xef\\xbf\\xbd From that\\nmoment, like an English murderer, he knew no peace; Conscience and\\nHazrat Ali haunted him.[FN#20] Finding\\n</p><p>[p.185] life unendurable at home, he sold everything; raised the sum of\\ntwenty pounds, and started for the Holy Land. He reached Jeddah with a\\nfew rupees in his pocket[;] and came to Meccah, where, everything being\\nexorbitantly dear and charity all but unknown, he might have starved,\\nhad he not been received by his old friend. The married pair and their\\nson had been taken as house-servants by the boy Mohammed\\xef\\xbf\\xbds mother, who\\ngenerously allowed them shelter and a pound of rice per diem to each,\\nbut not a farthing of pay. They were even expected to provide their own\\nturmeric and onions. Yet these poor people were anxiously awaiting the\\nopportunity to visit Al-Madinah, without which their pilgrimage would\\nnot, they believed, be complete. They would beg their way through the\\nterrible Desert and its Badawin\\xef\\xbf\\xbdan old man, a boy, and a woman! What were\\ntheir chances of returning to their homes? Such, I believe, is too\\noften the history of those wretches whom a fit of religious enthusiasm,\\nlikest to insanity, hurries away to the Holy Land. I strongly recommend\\nthe subject to the consideration of our Indian Government as one that\\ncalls loudly for their interference. No Eastern ruler parts, as we do,\\nwith his subjects; all object to lose productive power. To an \\xef\\xbf\\xbdEmpire of\\nOpinion\\xef\\xbf\\xbd this emigration is fraught with evils. It sends forth a horde of\\nmalcontents that ripen into bigots; it teaches foreign nations to\\ndespise our rule; and it unveils the present nakedness of once wealthy\\nIndia. And we have both prevention and cure in our own hands.\\n</p><p>As no Moslem, except the Maliki, is bound to pilgrimage without a sum\\nsufficient to support himself and his family, all who embark at the\\ndifferent ports of India should be obliged to prove their solvency\\nbefore being provided with a permit. Arrived at Jeddah, they should\\npresent the certificate at the British Vice-Consulate, where they would\\nbecome entitled to assistance in case of necessity. The Vice-Consul at\\nJeddah ought also to be instructed\\n</p><p>[p.186] to assist our Indian pilgrims. Mr. Cole, when holding that\\nappointment, informed me that, though men die of starvation in the\\nstreets, he was unable to relieve them. The highways of Meccah abound\\nin pathetic Indian beggars, who affect lank bodies, shrinking frames,\\nwhining voices, and all the circumstance of misery, because it supports\\nthem in idleness.\\n</p><p>There are no fewer than fifteen hundred Indians at Meccah and Jeddah,\\nbesides seven or eight hundred in Al-Yaman. Such a body requires a\\nConsul.[FN#21] By the representation of a Vice-Consul when other powers\\nsend an officer of superior rank to Al-Hijaz, we voluntarily place\\nourselves in an inferior position. And although the Meccan Sharif might\\nfor a time object to establishing a Moslem agent at the Holy City with\\norders to report to the Consul at Jeddah, his opposition would soon\\nfall to the ground.\\n</p><p>With the Indians\\xef\\xbf\\xbd assistance the boy Mohammed removed the handsome\\nPersian rugs with which he had covered the Shugduf, pitched the tent,\\ncarpeted the ground, disposed a Diwan of silk and satin cushions round\\nthe interior, and strewed the centre with new Chibuks, and highly\\npolished Shishahs. At the doorway was placed a large copper fire-pan,\\nwith coffee-pots singing a welcome to visitors. In front of us were the\\nlitters, and by divers similar arrangements our establishment was made\\nto look fine. The youth also insisted upon my removing the Rida, or\\nupper cotton cloth, which had become way-soiled, and he supplied its\\nplace by a rich cashmere, left with him, some years before, by a son of\\nthe King of Delhi. Little thought I that this bravery of attire would\\nlose me every word of the Arafat sermon next day.\\n</p><p>Arafat, anciently called Jabal Ilal ([Arabic]), \\xef\\xbf\\xbdthe Mount\\n</p><p>[p.187] of Wrestling in Prayer,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd and now Jabal al-Rahmah, the \\xef\\xbf\\xbdMount of\\nMercy,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd is a mass of coarse granite split into large blocks, with a thin\\ncoat of withered thorns. About one mile in circumference, it rises\\nabruptly to the height of a hundred and eighty or two hundred feet,\\nfrom the low gravelly plain\\xef\\xbf\\xbda dwarf wall at the Southern base forming the\\nline of demarcation. It is separated by Batn Arnah ([Arabic]), a sandy\\nvale,[FN#22] from the spurs of the Taif hills. Nothing can be more\\npicturesque than the view it affords of the azure peaks behind, and the\\nvast encampment scattered over the barren yellow plain below.[FN#23] On\\nthe North lay the regularly pitched camp of the guards that defend the\\nunarmed pilgrims. To the Eastward was the Sharif\\xef\\xbf\\xbds encampment, with the\\nbright Mahmils and\\n</p><p>[p.188] the gilt knobs of the grandees\\xef\\xbf\\xbd pavilions; whilst on the Southern\\nand Western sides the tents of the vulgar crowded the ground, disposed\\nin Dowar, or circles. After many calculations, I estimated the number\\nto be not fewer than 50,000 of all ages and sexes; a sad falling off,\\nit is true, but still considerable.\\n</p><p>Ali Bey (A.D. 1807) calculates 83,000 pilgrims; Burckhardt (1814),\\n70,000. I reduce it, in 1853, to 50,000; and in A.D. 1854, owing to\\npolitical causes, it fell to about 25,000. Of these at fewest 10,000\\nare Meccans, as every one who can leave the city does so at\\npilgrimage-time. The Arabs have a superstition that the numbers at\\nArafat cannot be counted, and that if fewer than 600,000 mortals stand\\nupon the hill to hear the sermon, the angels descend and complete the\\nnumber. Even this year my Arab friends declared that 150,000 spirits\\nwere present in human shape. It may be observed that when the good old\\nBertrand de la Brocquiere, esquire-carver to Philip of Burgundy,\\ndeclares that the yearly Caravan from Damascus to Al-Madinah must\\nalways be composed of 700,000 persons, and that this number being\\nincomplete, Allah sends some of his angels to make it up, he probably\\nconfounds the Caravan with the Arafat multitude.\\n</p><p>The Holy Hill owes its name[FN#24] and honours to a well-known legend.\\nWhen our first parents forfeited Heaven by eating wheat, which deprived\\nthem of their primeval purity, they were cast down upon earth. The\\nserpent descended at Ispahan, the peacock at Kabul, Satan at Bilbays\\n(others say Semnan and Seistan), Eve upon Arafat, and Adam at Ceylon.\\nThe latter, determining to seek his wife, began a journey, to which\\nearth owes its present mottled appearance. Wherever our first father\\n[p.189] placed his foot\\xef\\xbf\\xbdwhich was large\\xef\\xbf\\xbda town afterwards arose; between\\nthe strides will always be \\xef\\xbf\\xbdcountry.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd Wandering for many years, he came to\\nthe Mountain of Mercy, where our common mother was continually calling\\nupon his name, and their recognition gave the place the name of Arafat.\\nUpon its summit, Adam, instructed by the archangel Gabriel, erected a\\nMada\\xef\\xbf\\xbda, or place of prayer: and between this spot and the Nimrah Mosque\\nthe couple abode till death. Others declare that after recognition, the\\nfirst pair returned to India, whence for 44 years in succession they\\nvisited the Sacred City at pilgrimage-time.\\n</p><p>From the Holy Hill I walked down to look at the camp arrangements. The\\nmain street of tents and booths, huts and shops, was bright with\\nlanterns, and the bazars were crowded with people and stocked with all\\nmanner of Eastern delicacies. Some anomalous spectacles met the eye.\\nMany pilgrims, especially the soldiers, were in laical costume. In one\\nplace a half-drunken Arnaut stalked down the road, elbowing peaceful\\npassengers and frowning fiercely in hopes of a quarrel. In another\\npart, a huge dimly-lit tent, reeking hot, and garnished with cane\\nseats, contained knots of Egyptians, as their red Tarbushes, white\\nturbands, and black Za\\xef\\xbf\\xbdabuts showed, noisily intoxicating themselves with\\nforbidden hemp. There were frequent brawls and great confusion; many\\nmen had lost their parties, and, mixed with loud Labbayks, rose the\\nshouted names of women as well as of men. I was surprised at the\\ndisproportion of female nomenclature\\xef\\xbf\\xbdthe missing number of fair ones\\nseemed to double that of the other sex\\xef\\xbf\\xbdand at a practice so opposed to\\nthe customs of the Moslem world. At length the boy Mohammed enlightened\\nme. Egyptian and other bold women, when unable to join the pilgrimage,\\nwill pay or persuade a friend to shout their names\\n</p><p>[p.190] in hearing of the Holy Hill, with a view of ensuring a real\\npresence at the desired spot next year. So the welkin rang with the\\nindecent sounds of O Fatimah! O Zaynab! O Khayz\\xef\\xbf\\xbdran![FN#25] Plunderers,\\ntoo, were abroad. As we returned to the tent we found a crowd assembled\\nnear it; a woman had seized a thief as he was beginning operations, and\\nhad the courage to hold his beard till men ran to her assistance. And\\nwe were obliged to defend by force our position against a knot of\\ngrave-diggers, who would bury a little heap of bodies within a yard or\\ntwo of our tent.\\n</p><p>One point struck me at once\\xef\\xbf\\xbdthe difference in point of cleanliness\\nbetween an encampment of citizens and of Badawin. Poor Mas\\xef\\xbf\\xbdud sat holding\\nhis nose in ineffable disgust, for which he was derided by the Meccans.\\nI consoled him with quoting the celebrated song of Maysunah, the\\nbeautiful Badawi wife of the Caliph Mu\\xef\\xbf\\xbdawiyah. Nothing can be more\\ncharming in its own Arabic than this little song; the Badawin never\\nhear it without screams of joy.\\n</p><p>\\xef\\xbf\\xbdO take these purple robes away,\\nGive back my cloak of camel\\xef\\xbf\\xbds hair,\\nAnd bear me from this tow\\xef\\xbf\\xbdring pile\\nTo where the Black Tents flap i\\xef\\xbf\\xbd the air.\\nThe camel\\xef\\xbf\\xbds colt with falt\\xef\\xbf\\xbdring tread,\\nThe dog that bays at all but me,\\nDelight me more than ambling mules\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\nThan every art of minstrelsy;\\nAnd any cousin, poor but free,\\nMight take me, fatted ass! from thee.[FN#26]\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n</p><p>[p.191] The old man, delighted, clapped my shoulder, and exclaimed,\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbdVerily, O Father of Mustachios, I will show thee the black tents of my\\ntribe this year!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n</p><p>At length night came, and we threw ourselves upon our rugs, but not to\\nsleep. Close by, to our bane, was a prayerful old gentleman, who began\\nhis devotions at a late hour and concluded them not before dawn. He\\nreminded me of the undergraduate my neighbour at Trinity College,\\nOxford, who would spout Aeschylus at two A.M. Sometimes the chant would\\ngrow drowsy, and my ears would hear a dull retreating sound; presently,\\nas if in self-reproach, it would rise to a sharp treble, and proceed at\\na rate perfectly appalling. The coffee-houses, too, were by no means\\nsilent; deep into the night I heard the clapping of hands accompanying\\nmerry Arab songs, and the loud shouts of laughter of the Egyptian\\nhemp-drinkers. And the guards and protectors of the camp were not\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbdCharleys\\xef\\xbf\\xbd or night-nurses.\\n</p><p>[FN#1] Pilgrims who would win the heavenly reward promised to those who\\nwalk, start at an early hour.\\n[FN#2] The true Badawi, when in the tainted atmosphere of towns, is\\nalways known by bits of cotton in his nostrils, or by his kerchief\\ntightly drawn over his nose, a heavy frown marking extreme disgust.\\n[FN#3] Anciently called Hira. It is still visited as the place of the\\nProphet\\xef\\xbf\\xbds early lucubrations, and because here the first verse of the\\nKoran descended. As I did not ascend the hill, I must refer readers for\\na description of it to Burckhardt, vol. i. p. 320.\\n[FN#4] Al-Abtah, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdlow ground\\xef\\xbf\\xbd; Al Khayf, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdthe declivity\\xef\\xbf\\xbd; Fina Makkah, the \\xef\\xbf\\xbdcourt\\nof Meccah\\xef\\xbf\\xbd; Al-Muhassib (from Hasba, a shining white pebble), corrupted\\nby our authors to Mihsab and Mohsab.\\n[FN#5] The spot where Kusay fought and where Mohammed made his covenant.\\n[FN#6] If Ptolemy\\xef\\xbf\\xbds \\xef\\xbf\\xbdMin\\xef\\xbf\\xbdi\\xef\\xbf\\xbd be rightly located in this valley, the present name\\nand derivation \\xef\\xbf\\xbdMuna\\xef\\xbf\\xbd (desire), because Adam here desired Paradise of\\nAllah, must be modern. Sale, following Pococke, makes \\xef\\xbf\\xbdMina\\xef\\xbf\\xbd (from Mana)\\nallude to the flowing of victims\\xef\\xbf\\xbd blood. Possibly it may be the plural of\\nMinyat, which in many Arabic dialects means a village. This basin was\\ndoubtless thickly populated in ancient times, and Moslem historians\\nmention its seven idols, representing the seven planets.\\n[FN#7] According to Mohammed the pebbles of the accepted are removed by\\nangels; as, however, each man and woman must throw 49 or 70 stones, it\\nis fair to suspect the intervention of something more material. Animals\\nare frightened away by the bustling crowd, and flies are found in\\nmyriads.\\n[FN#8] This demoniacal practice is still as firmly believed in Arabia\\nas it formerly was in Europe.\\n[FN#9] Probably because here Satan appeared to tempt Adam, Abraham, and\\nIshmael. The Qanoon e Islam erroneously calls it the \\xef\\xbf\\xbdValley of Muhasurah,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\nand corrupts Mashar al-Haram into \\xef\\xbf\\xbdMuzar al-Haram\\xef\\xbf\\xbd (the holy shrine).\\n[FN#10] Many, even since Sale corrected the error, have confounded this\\nMashar al-Haram with Masjid al-H?r?m of Meccah. According to Al-Fasi,\\nquoted by Burckhardt, it is the name of a little eminence at the end of\\nthe Muzdalifah valley, and anciently called Jabal Kuzah; it is also, he\\nsays, applied to \\xef\\xbf\\xbdan elevated platform inclosing the mosque of Muzdalifah.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\nIbn Jubayr makes Mashar al-Haram synonymous with Muzdalifah, to which\\nhe gives a third name, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdJami.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n[FN#11] Buckhardt calls it \\xef\\xbf\\xbdMazoumeyn,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd or Al-Mazik, the pass. \\xef\\xbf\\xbdAkeshab\\xef\\xbf\\xbd may\\nmean wooded or rugged; in which latter sense it is frequently applied\\nto hills. Kayka\\xef\\xbf\\xbdan and Abu Kubays at Meccah are called Al-Akshshabayn in\\nsome books. The left hill, in Ibn Jubayr\\xef\\xbf\\xbds time, was celebrated as a\\nmeeting-place for brigands.\\n[FN#12] Kutb al-Din makes another Bazan the Southern limit of Meccah.\\n[FN#13] Burckhardt calls this building, which he confounds with the \\xef\\xbf\\xbdJami\\nIbrahim,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd the Jami Nimre; others Namirah, Nimrah, Namrah, and Namurah. It\\nwas erected, he says, by Kait Bey of Egypt, and had fallen into decay.\\nIt has now been repaired, and is generally considered neutral, and not\\nSanctuary ground, between the Harim of Meccah and the Holy Hill.\\n[FN#14] Mr. W. Muir, in his valuable Life of Mahomet, vol. i, p. ccv.,\\nremarks upon this passage that at p. 180 ante, I made Muna three miles\\nfrom Meccah, and Muzdalifah about three miles from Muna, and Arafat\\nthree miles from Muzdalifah,\\xef\\xbf\\xbda total of nine. But the lesser estimate\\ndoes not include the outskirts of Meccah on the breadth of the Arafat\\nPlain. The Calcutta Review (art. 1, Sept. 1853) notably errs in making\\nArafat eighteen miles east of Meccah. Ibn Jubayr reckons five miles\\nfrom Meccah to Muzdalifah, and five from this to Arafat.\\n[FN#15] Those who die on a pilgrimage become martyrs.\\n[FN#16] I cannot help believing that some unknown cause renders death\\neasier to man in hot than in cold climates; certain it is that in\\nEurope rare are the quiet and painless deathbeds so common in the East.\\n[FN#17] We bury our dead, to preserve them as it were; the Moslem tries\\nto secure rapid decomposition, and makes the graveyard a dangerous as\\nwell as a disagreeable place.\\n[FN#18] Arabs observe that Indians, unless brought young into the\\ncountry, never learn its language well. They have a word to express the\\nvicious pronunciation of a slave or an Indian, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdBarbaret al-Hunud.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd This\\nroot Barbara ([Arabic]), like the Greek \\xef\\xbf\\xbdBarbaros,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd appears to be derived\\nfrom the Sanscrit Varvvaraha, an outcast, a barbarian, a man with curly\\nhair.\\n[FN#19] Ali\\xef\\xbf\\xbds charger was named Maymun, or, according to others, Zu\\xef\\xbf\\xbdl Janah\\n(the winged). Indians generally confound it with \\xef\\xbf\\xbdDuldul,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd Mohammed\\xef\\xbf\\xbds mule.\\n[FN#20] These visions are common in history. Ali appeared to the Imam\\nShafe\\xef\\xbf\\xbdi, saluted him,\\xef\\xbf\\xbdan omen of eternal felicity,\\xef\\xbf\\xbdplaced a ring upon his\\nfinger, as a sign that his fame should extend wide as the donor\\xef\\xbf\\xbds, and\\nsent him to the Holy Land. Ibrahim bin Adham, the saint-poet hearing,\\nwhen hunting, a voice exclaim, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdMan! it is not for this that Allah made\\nthee!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd answered, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdIt is Allah who speaks, his servant will obey!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd He changed\\nclothes with an attendant, and wandered forth upon a pilgrimage,\\ncelebrated in Al-Islam. He performed it alone, and making 1100\\ngenuflexions each mile, prolonged it to twelve years. The history of\\nColonel Gardiner, and of many others amongst ourselves, prove that\\nthese visions are not confined to the Arabs.\\n[FN#21] There is a Consul for Jeddah now, 1879, but till lately he was\\nan unpaid.\\n[FN#22] This vale is not considered \\xef\\xbf\\xbdstanding-ground,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd because Satan once\\nappeared to the Prophet as he was traversing it.\\n[FN#23] According to Kutb al-Din, the Arafat plain was once highly\\ncultivated. Stone-lined cisterns abound, and ruins of buildings are\\nfrequent. At the Eastern foot of the mountain was a broad canal,\\nbeginning at a spur of the Taif hills, and conveying water to Meccah;\\nit is now destroyed beyond Arafat. The plain is cut with torrents,\\nwhich at times sweep with desolating violence into the Holy City, and a\\nthick desert vegetation shows that water is not deep below the surface.\\n[FN#24] The word is explained in many ways. One derivation has already\\nbeen mentioned. Others assert that when Gabriel taught Abraham the\\nceremonies, he ended by saying \\xef\\xbf\\xbdA\\xef\\xbf\\xbdarafata manasik\\xef\\xbf\\xbdak?\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\xef\\xbf\\xbdhast thou learned thy\\npilgrim rites? To which the Friend of Allah replied, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdAraftu!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\xef\\xbf\\xbdI have learned\\nthem.\\n[FN#25] The latter name, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdRatan,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd is servile. Respectable women are never\\npublicly addressed by Moslems except as \\xef\\xbf\\xbddaughter,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd \\xef\\xbf\\xbdfemale pilgrim,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd after\\nsome male relation, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdO mother of Mohammed,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd \\xef\\xbf\\xbdO sister of Omar,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd or, tout\\nbonnement, by a man\\xef\\xbf\\xbds name. It would be ill-omened and dangerous were the\\ntrue name known. So most women, when travelling, adopt an alias.\\nWhoever knew an Afghan fair who was not \\xef\\xbf\\xbdNur Jan,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd or \\xef\\xbf\\xbdSahib Jan\\xef\\xbf\\xbd?\\n[FN#26] The British reader will be shocked to hear that by the term\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbdfatted ass\\xef\\xbf\\xbd the intellectual lady alluded to her husband. The story is\\nthat Mu\\xef\\xbf\\xbdawiyah, overhearing the song, sent back the singer to her cousin\\nand beloved wilds. Maysunah departed with her son Yazid, and did not\\nreturn to Damascus till the \\xef\\xbf\\xbdfatted ass\\xef\\xbf\\xbd had joined his forefathers. Yazid\\ninherited, with his mother\\xef\\xbf\\xbds talents, all her contempt for his father; at\\nleast the following quatrain, addressed to Mu\\xef\\xbf\\xbdawiyah, and generally known\\nin Al-Islam, would appear to argue anything but reverence:\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n</p><p>\\xef\\xbf\\xbdI drank the water of the vine: that draught had power to rouse\\nThy wrath, grim father! now, indeed, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdtis joyous to carouse!\\nI\\xef\\xbf\\xbdll drink!\\xef\\xbf\\xbdBe wroth!\\xef\\xbf\\xbdI reck not!\\xef\\xbf\\xbdAh! dear to this heart of mine\\nIt is to scoff a sire\\xef\\xbf\\xbds command, to quaff forbidden wine.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n</p>\\n<h2><span id=\"Chapter_XXIX._THE_CEREMONIES_OF_THE_YAUM_ARAFAT.2C_OR_THE_SECOND_DAY.\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Chapter_XXIX._THE_CEREMONIES_OF_THE_YAUM_ARAFAT,_OR_THE_SECOND_DAY.\">Chapter XXIX.

THE CEREMONIES OF THE YAUM ARAFAT, OR THE SECOND DAY.\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\\n<p>THE morning of the ninth Zu\\xef\\xbf\\xbdl Hijjah (Tuesday, 13th Sept.) was ushered in\\nby military sounds: a loud discharge of cannon warned us to arise and\\nto prepare for the ceremonies of this eventful day.\\n</p><p>After ablution and prayer, I proceeded with the boy Mohammed to inspect\\nthe numerous consecrated sites on the \\xef\\xbf\\xbdMountain of Mercy.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd In the first\\nplace, we repaired to a spot on rising ground to the south-east, and\\nwithin a hundred yards of the hill. It is called \\xef\\xbf\\xbdJami al-Sakhrah[FN#1]\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\xef\\xbf\\xbdthe\\nAssembling Place of the Rock\\xef\\xbf\\xbdfrom two granite boulders upon which the\\nProphet stood to perform \\xef\\xbf\\xbdTalbiyat.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd There is nothing but a small enclosure\\nof dwarf and whitewashed stone walls, divided into halves for men and\\nwomen by a similar partition, and provided with a niche to direct\\nprayer towards Meccah. Entering by steps, we found crowds of devotees\\nand guardians, who for a consideration offered mats and carpets. After\\na two-bow prayer and a long supplication opposite the niche, we retired\\nto the inner compartment, stood upon a boulder and shouted the \\xef\\xbf\\xbdLabbayk.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n</p><p>Thence, threading our way through many obstacles\\n</p><p>[p.193] of tent and stone, we ascended the broad flight of rugged steps\\nwhich winds up the southern face of the rocky hill. Even at this early\\nhour it was crowded with pilgrims, principally Badawin and Wahhabis,\\nwho had secured favourable positions for hearing the sermon. Already\\ntheir green flag was planted upon the summit close to Adam\\xef\\xbf\\xbds Place of\\nPrayer. The wilder Arabs insist that \\xef\\xbf\\xbdWukuf\\xef\\xbf\\xbd (standing) should take place\\nupon the Hill. This is not done by the more civilised, who hold that\\nall the plain within the Alamayn ranks as Arafat. According to Ali Bey,\\nthe Maliki school is not allowed to stand upon the mountain. About half\\nway up I counted sixty-six steps, and remarked that they became\\nnarrower and steeper. Crowds of beggars instantly seized the pilgrims\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\nrobes, and strove to prevent our entering a second enclosure. This\\nplace, which resembles the former, except that it has but one\\ncompartment and no boulders, is that whence Mohammed used to address\\nhis followers; and here, to the present day, the Khatib, or preacher,\\nin imitation of the \\xef\\xbf\\xbdLast of the Prophets,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd sitting upon a dromedary,\\nrecites the Arafat sermon. Here, also, we prayed a two-bow prayer, and\\ngave a small sum to the guardian.\\n</p><p>Thence ascending with increased difficulty to the hill-top, we arrived\\nat a large stuccoed platform,[FN#2] with prayer-niche and a kind of\\nobelisk, mean and badly built of lime and granite stone, whitewashed,\\nand conspicuous from afar. It is called the Makam, or Mada\\xef\\xbf\\xbda Sayyidna\\nAdam.[FN#3]  Here we performed the customary ceremonies amongst a crowd\\nof pilgrims, and then we walked down the little hill.\\n</p><p>[p.194] Close to the plain we saw the place where the Egyptian and\\nDamascus Mahmils stand during the sermon; and, descending the wall that\\nsurrounds Arafat by a steep and narrow flight of coarse stone steps, we\\nfound on our right the fountain which supplies the place with water. It\\nbubbles from the rock, and is exceedingly pure, as such water generally\\nis in Al-Hijaz.\\n</p><p>Our excursion employed us longer than the description requires\\xef\\xbf\\xbdnine o\\xef\\xbf\\xbdclock\\nhad struck before we reached the plain. All were in a state of\\nexcitement. Guns fired incessantly. Horsemen and camel-riders galloped\\nabout without apparent object. Even the women and the children stood\\nand walked, too restless even to sleep. Arrived at the tent, I was\\nunpleasantly surprised to find a new visitor in an old acquaintance,\\nAli ibn Ya Sin the Zemzemi. He had lost his mule, and, wandering in\\nsearch of its keepers, he unfortunately fell in with our party. I had\\nsolid reasons to regret the mishap\\xef\\xbf\\xbdhe was far too curious and too\\nobservant to suit my tastes. On the present occasion, he, being\\nuncomfortable, made us equally so. Accustomed to all the terrible\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbdneatness\\xef\\xbf\\xbd of an elderly damsel in Great Britain, a few specks of dirt upon\\nthe rugs, and half a dozen bits of cinder upon the ground, sufficed to\\ngive him attacks of \\xef\\xbf\\xbdnerves.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n</p><p>That day we breakfasted late, for night must come before we could eat\\nagain. After mid-day prayer we performed ablutions; some the greater,\\nothers the less, in preparation for the \\xef\\xbf\\xbdWukuf,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd or Standing. From noon\\nonwards the hum and murmur of the multitude increased, and people were\\nseen swarming about in all directions.\\n</p><p>A second discharge of cannon (at about 3.15 P.M.) announced the\\napproach of Al-Asr, the afternoon prayer, and almost immediately we\\nheard the Naubat, or band preceding the Sharif\\xef\\xbf\\xbds procession, as he wended\\nhis way towards the mountain. Fortunately my tent was pitched close to\\nthe road, so that without trouble I had a perfect\\n</p><p>[p.195] view of the scene. First swept a cloud of mace-bearers, who, as\\nusual on such occasions, cleared the path with scant ceremony. They\\nwere followed by the horsemen of the Desert, wielding long and tufted\\nspears. Immediately behind them came the Sharif\\xef\\xbf\\xbds led horses, upon which\\nI fixed a curious eye. All were highly bred, and one, a brown Nijdi\\nwith black points, struck me as the perfection of an Arab. They were\\nsmall, and all were apparently of the northern race.[FN#4] Of their old\\ncrimson-velvet\\n</p><p>[p.196] caparisons the less said the better; no little Indian Nawab\\nwould show aught so shabby on state occasions.\\n</p><p>After the chargers paraded a band of black slaves on foot bearing huge\\nmatchlocks; and immediately preceded by three green and two red flags,\\ncame the Sharif, riding in front of his family and courtiers. The\\nprince, habited in a simple white Ihram, and bare-headed, mounted a\\nmule; the only sign of his rank was a large green and gold embroidered\\numbrella, held over him by a slave. The rear was brought up by another\\ntroop of Badawin on horses and camels. Behind this procession were the\\ntents, whose doors and walls were scarcely visible for the crowd; and\\nthe picturesque background was the granite hill, covered, wherever\\nstanding-room was to be found, with white-robed pilgrims shouting\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbdLabbayk,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd and waving the skirts of their glistening garments violently\\nover their heads.\\n</p><p>Slowly and solemnly the procession advanced towards the hill. Exactly\\nat the hour Al-Asr, the two Mahmils had taken their station side by\\nside on a platform in the lower slope. That of Damascus could be\\ndistinguished as the narrower and the more ornamented of the pair. The\\nSharif placed himself with his standard-bearers and his retinue a\\nlittle above the Mahmils, within hearing of the preacher. The pilgrims\\ncrowded up to the foot of the mountain: the loud \\xef\\xbf\\xbdLabbayk\\xef\\xbf\\xbd of the Badawin\\nand\\n</p><p>[p.197] Wahhabis[FN#5] fell to a solemn silence, and the waving of\\nwhite robes ceased\\xef\\xbf\\xbda sign that the preacher had begun the Khutbat\\nal-Wakfah, or Sermon of the Standing (upon Arafat). From my tent I\\ncould distinguish the form of the old man upon his camel, but the\\ndistance was too great for ear to reach.\\n</p><p>But how came I to be at the tent?\\n</p><p>A short confession will explain. They will shrive me who believe in\\ninspired Spenser\\xef\\xbf\\xbds lines\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n</p><p>\\xef\\xbf\\xbdAnd every spirit, as it is more pure,\\nAnd hath in it the more of heavenly light,\\nSo it the fairer body doth procure\\nTo habit in.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n</p><p>The evil came of a \\xef\\xbf\\xbdfairer body.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd I had prepared en cachette a slip of\\npaper, and had hid in my Ihram a pencil destined to put down the heads\\nof this rarely heard discourse. But unhappily that red cashmere shawl\\nwas upon my shoulders. Close to us sat a party of fair Meccans,\\napparently belonging to the higher classes, and one of these I had\\nalready several times remarked. She was a tall girl, about eighteen\\nyears old, with regular features, a skin somewhat citrine-coloured, but\\nsoft and clear, symmetrical eyebrows, the most beautiful eyes, and a\\nfigure all grace. There was no head thrown back, no straightened neck,\\nno flat shoulders, nor toes turned out\\xef\\xbf\\xbdin fact, no \\xef\\xbf\\xbdelegant\\xef\\xbf\\xbd barbarisms: the\\nshape was what the Arabs love, soft, bending, and relaxed, as a woman\\xef\\xbf\\xbds\\n</p><p>[p.198] figure ought to be. Unhappily she wore, instead of the usual\\nveil, a \\xef\\xbf\\xbdYashmak\\xef\\xbf\\xbd of transparent muslin, bound round the face; and the\\nchaperone, mother, or duenna, by whose side she stood, was apparently a\\nvery unsuspicious or complaisant old person. Flirtilla fixed a glance\\nof admiration upon my cashmere. I directed a reply with interest at her\\neyes. She then by the usual coquettish gesture, threw back an inch or\\ntwo of head-veil, disclosing broad bands of jetty hair, crowning a\\nlovely oval. My palpable admiration of the new charm was rewarded by a\\npartial removal of the Yashmak, when a dimpled mouth and a rounded chin\\nstood out from the envious muslin. Seeing that my companions were\\nsafely employed, I entered upon the dangerous ground of raising hand to\\nforehead. She smiled almost imperceptibly, and turned away. The pilgrim\\nwas in ecstasy.\\n</p><p>The sermon was then half over. I was resolved to stay upon the plain\\nand see what Flirtilla would do. Grace to the cashmere, we came to a\\ngood understanding. The next page will record my disappointment\\xef\\xbf\\xbdthat\\nevening the pilgrim resumed his soiled cotton cloth, and testily\\nreturned the red shawl to the boy Mohammed.\\n</p><p>The sermon always lasts till near sunset, or about three hours. At\\nfirst it was spoken amid profound silence. Then loud, scattered \\xef\\xbf\\xbdAmins\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n(Amens) and volleys of \\xef\\xbf\\xbdLabbayk\\xef\\xbf\\xbd exploded at uncertain intervals[.] At last\\nthe breeze brought to our ears a purgatorial chorus of cries, sobs, and\\nshrieks. Even my party thought proper to be affected: old Ali rubbed\\nhis eyes, which in no case unconnected with dollars could by any amount\\nof straining be made to shed even a crocodile\\xef\\xbf\\xbds tear; and the boy\\nMohammed wisely hid his face in the skirt of his Rida. Presently the\\npeople, exhausted by emotion, began to descend the hill in small\\nparties; and those below struck their tents and commenced loading their\\ncamels, although at least an hour\\xef\\xbf\\xbds sermon remained. On this occassion,\\n[p.199] however, all hurry to be foremost, as the \\xef\\xbf\\xbdrace from Arafat\\xef\\xbf\\xbd is\\nenjoyed by none but the Badawin.\\n</p><p>Although we worked with a will, our animals were not ready to move\\nbefore sunset, when the preacher gave the signal of \\xef\\xbf\\xbdIsraf,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd or permission\\nto depart. The pilgrims,\\n</p><p>\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\xef\\xbf\\xbdswaying to and fro,\\nLike waves of a great sea, that in mid shock\\nConfound each other, white with foam and fear,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n</p><p>rushed down the hill with a \\xef\\xbf\\xbdLabbayk\\xef\\xbf\\xbd sounding like a blast, and took the\\nroad to Muna. Then I saw the scene which has given to this part of the\\nceremonies the name of Al-Daf\\xef\\xbf\\xbda min Arafat,\\xef\\xbf\\xbdthe \\xef\\xbf\\xbdHurry from Arafat.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd Every man\\nurged his beast with might and main: it was sunset; the plain bristled\\nwith tent-pegs, litters were crushed, pedestrians were trampled, camels\\nwere overthrown: single combats with sticks and other weapons took\\nplace; here a woman, there a child, and there an animal were lost;\\nbriefly, it was a chaotic confusion.\\n</p><p>To my disgust, old Ali insisted upon bestowing his company upon me. He\\ngave over his newly found mule to the boy Mohammed, bidding him take\\ncare of the beast, and mounted with me in the Shugduf. I had persuaded\\nShaykh Mas\\xef\\xbf\\xbdud, with a dollar, to keep close in rear of the pretty Meccan;\\nand I wanted to sketch the Holy Hill. The senior began to give orders\\nabout the camel\\xef\\xbf\\xbdI, counter-orders. The camel was halted. I urged it on:\\nold Ali directed it to be stopped. Meanwhile the charming face that\\nsmiled at me from the litter grew dimmer and dimmer; the more I\\nstormed, the less I was listened to\\xef\\xbf\\xbda string of camels crossed our path\\xef\\xbf\\xbdI\\nlost sight of the beauty. Then we began to advance. Again, my\\ndetermination to sketch seemed likely to fail before the Zemzemi\\xef\\xbf\\xbds little\\nsnake\\xef\\xbf\\xbds eye. After a few minutes\\xef\\xbf\\xbd angry search for expedients, one\\nsuggested itself. \\xef\\xbf\\xbdEffendi!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd said old Ali, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdsit quiet; there is danger here.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd I\\ntossed about like one suffering from evil conscience or from the\\n</p><p>[p.200] colic. \\xef\\xbf\\xbdEffendi!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd shrieked the senior, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdwhat art thou doing? Thou\\nwilt be the death of us.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd \\xef\\xbf\\xbdWallah!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd I replied with a violent plunge, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdit is all\\nthy fault! There!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd (another plunge)\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\xef\\xbf\\xbdput thy beard out of the other opening,\\nand Allah will make it easy to us.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd In the ecstasy of fear my tormentor\\nturned his face, as he was bidden, towards the camel\\xef\\xbf\\xbds head. A second\\nhalt ensued, when I looked out of the aperture in rear, and made a\\nrough drawing of the Mountain of Mercy.\\n</p><p>At the Akhshabayn, double lines of camels, bristling with litters,\\nclashed with a shock more noisy than the meeting of torrents. It was\\nalready dark: no man knew what he was doing. The guns roared their\\nbrazen notes, re-echoed far and wide by the harsh voices of the stony\\nhills. A shower of rockets bursting in the air threw into still greater\\nconfusion the timorous mob of women and children. At the same time\\nmartial music rose from the masses of Nizam and the stouter-hearted\\npilgrims were not sparing of their Labbayk[FN#6] and \\xef\\xbf\\xbdid kum\\nMubarak[FN#7]\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\xef\\xbf\\xbdMay your Festival be happy!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n</p><p>After the pass of the Two Rugged Hills, the road widened, and old Ali,\\nwho, during the bumping, had been in a silent convulsion of terror,\\nrecovered speech and spirits. This change he evidenced by beginning to\\nbe troublesome once more. Again I resolved to be his equal. Exclaiming,\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbdMy eyes are yellow with hunger!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd I seized a pot full of savoury meat which\\nthe old man had previously stored for supper, and, without further\\npreamble, began to eat it greedily, at the same time ready to shout\\nwith laughter at the mumbling and grumbling sounds that proceeded from\\nthe darkness of the litter. We were at least three hours on the road\\nbefore reaching\\n</p><p>[p.201] Muzdalifah, and being fatigued, we resolved to pass the night\\nthere.[FN#8] The Mosque was brilliantly illuminated, but my hungry\\ncompanions[FN#9] apparently thought more of supper and of sleep than of\\ndevotion.[FN#10] Whilst the tent was being raised, the Indians prepared\\nour food, boiled our coffee, filled our pipes, and spread our rugs.\\nBefore sleeping each man collected for himself seven \\xef\\xbf\\xbdJamrah\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\xef\\xbf\\xbdbits of granite\\nthe size of a small bean.[FN#11] Then, weary with emotion and exertion,\\nall lay down except the boy Mohammed, who preceded us to find encamping\\nground at Muna. Old Ali, in lending his mule, made the most stringent\\narrangements with the youth about the exact place and the exact hour of\\nmeeting\\xef\\xbf\\xbdan act of simplicity at which I could not but smile. The night\\nwas by no means peaceful or silent. Lines of camels passed us every ten\\nminutes, and the shouting of travellers continued till near dawn.\\nPilgrims ought to have nighted at the Mosque, but, as in Burckhardt\\xef\\xbf\\xbds\\ntime, so in mine, baggage was considered to be in danger thereabouts,\\nand consequently most of the devotees spent the sermon-hours in\\nbrooding over their boxes.\\n</p><p>[FN#1] Ali Bey calls it \\xef\\xbf\\xbdJami al-Rahmah\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\xef\\xbf\\xbdof mercy.\\n[FN#2] Here was a small chapel, which the Wahhabis were demolishing\\nwhen Ali Bey was at Meccah. It has not been rebuilt. Upon this spot the\\nProphet, according to Burckhardt, used to stand during the ceremonies.\\n[FN#3] Burckhardt gives this name to a place a little way on the left\\nand about forty steps up the mountain.\\n[FN#4] In Solomon\\xef\\xbf\\xbds time the Egyptian horse cost 150 silver shekels,\\nwhich, if the greater shekel be meant, would still be about the average\\nprice, \\xef\\xbf\\xbd18. Abbas, the late Pasha, did his best to buy first-rate Arab\\nstallions: on one occasion he sent a mission to Al-Madinah for the sole\\npurpose of fetching a rare work on farriery. Yet it is doubted whether\\nhe ever had a first-rate Nijdi. A Badawi sent to Cairo by one of the\\nchiefs of Nijd, being shown by the viceroy\\xef\\xbf\\xbds order over the stables, on\\nbeing asked his opinion of the blood, replied bluntly, to the great man\\xef\\xbf\\xbds\\ndisgust, that they did not contain a single thoroughbred[.] He added an\\napology on the part of his laird for the animals he had brought from\\nArabia, saying, that neither Sultan nor Shaykh could procure colts of\\nthe best strain. For none of these horses would a staunch admirer of\\nthe long-legged monster called in England a thoroughbred give twenty\\npounds. They are mere \\xef\\xbf\\xbdrats,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd short and stunted, ragged and fleshless, with\\nrough coats and a slouching walk. But the experienced glance notes at\\nonce the fine snake-like head, ears like reeds, wide and projecting\\nnostrils, large eyes, fiery and soft alternately, broad brow, deep base\\nof skull, wide chest, crooked tail, limbs padded with muscle, and long\\nelastic pasterns. And the animal put out to speed soon displays the\\nwondrous force of blood. In fact, when buying Arabs, there are only\\nthree things to be considered,\\xef\\xbf\\xbdblood, blood, and again blood. In Marco\\nPolo\\xef\\xbf\\xbds time, Aden supplied the Indian market. The state of the tribes\\nround the \\xef\\xbf\\xbdEye of Yaman\\xef\\xbf\\xbd has effectually closed the road against\\nhorse-caravans for many years past. It is said that the Zu Mohammed and\\nthe Zu Hosayn, sub-families of the Benu Yam, a large tribe living\\naround and north of Sana\\xef\\xbf\\xbda, in Al-Yaman, have a fine large breed called\\nAl-Jaufi, and the clan Al-Aulaki, ([Arabic]), rear animals celebrated\\nfor swiftness and endurance. The other races are stunted, and some\\nArabs declare that the air of Al-Yaman causes a degeneracy in the first\\ngeneration. The Badawin, on the contrary, uphold their superiority, and\\ntalk with the utmost contempt of the African horse. In India we now\\ndepend for Arab blood upon the Persian Gulf, and the consequences of\\nmonopoly display themselves in an increased price for inferior animals.\\nOur studs are generally believed to be sinks for rupees. The\\nGovernments of India now object, it is said, to rearing, at a great\\ncost, animals distinguished by nothing but ferocity. It is evident that\\nAl-Hijaz never can stock the Indian market. Whether Al-Nijd will supply\\nus when the transit becomes safer, is a consideration which time only\\ncan decide. Meanwhile it would be highly advisable to take steps for\\nrestoring the Aden trade by entering into closer relations with the\\nImam of Sana\\xef\\xbf\\xbda and the Badawi chiefs in the North of Al-Yaman.\\n[FN#5] I obtained the following note upon the ceremonies of Wahhabi\\npilgrimage from one of their princes, Khalid Bey:\\xef\\xbf\\xbdThe Wahhabi (who, it\\nmust be borne in mind, calls himself a Muwahhid, or Unitarian, in\\nopposition to Mushrik\\xef\\xbf\\xbdPolytheist\\xef\\xbf\\xbdany other sect but his own) at Meccah\\nfollows out his two principal tenets, public prayer for men daily, for\\nwomen on Fridays, and rejection of the Prophet\\xef\\xbf\\xbds mediation. Imitating\\nMohammed, he spends the first night of pilgrimage at Muna, stands upon\\nthe hill Arafat, and, returning to Muna, passes three whole days there.\\nHe derides other Moslems, abridges and simplifies the Ka\\xef\\xbf\\xbdabah ceremonies,\\nand, if possible, is guided in his devotions by one of his own sect.\\n[FN#6] This cry is repeated till the pilgrim reaches Muna; not\\nafterwards.\\n[FN#7] Another phrase is \\xef\\xbf\\xbdAntum min al-aidin\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\xef\\xbf\\xbdMay you be of the keepers of\\nfestival!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n[FN#8] Hanafis usually follow the Prophet\\xef\\xbf\\xbds example in nighting at\\nMuzdalifah; in the evening after prayers they attend at the Mosque,\\nlisten to the discourse, and shed plentiful tears.

By this means we lost at Muzdalifah the \\xef\\xbf\\xbdSalat\\nal-id,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd or \\xef\\xbf\\xbdFestival Prayers,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd the great solemnity of the Moslem year,\\nperformed by all the community at daybreak. My companion was so anxious\\nto reach Meccah, that he would not hear of devotions. About eight A.M.\\nwe entered the village, and looked for the boy Mohammed in vain. Old\\nAli was dreadfully perplexed; a host of high-born Turkish pilgrims\\nwere, he said, expecting him; his mule was missing\\xef\\xbf\\xbdcould never appear\\xef\\xbf\\xbdhe\\nmust be late\\xef\\xbf\\xbdshould probably never reach Meccah\\xef\\xbf\\xbdwhat would become of him? I\\nbegan by administering admonition to the mind diseased; but signally\\nfailing in a cure, I amused myself with contemplating the world from my\\nShugduf, leaving the office of directing it to the old Zemzemi. Now he\\nstopped, then he pressed forward; here he thought he saw Mohammed,\\nthere he discovered our tent; at one time he would \\xef\\xbf\\xbdnakh\\xef\\xbf\\xbd the camel to\\nawait, in patience, his supreme hour; at another, half mad with\\nnervousness, he would urge the excellent Mas\\xef\\xbf\\xbdud to hopeless inquiries.\\nFinally, by good fortune, we found one of the boy Mohammed\\xef\\xbf\\xbds cousins, who\\nled us to an enclosure\\n[p.203] called Hosh al-Uzam, in the Southern portion of the Muna Basin,\\nat the base of Mount Sabir.[FN#1] There we pitched the tent, refreshed\\nourselves, and awaited the truant\\xef\\xbf\\xbds return. Old Ali, failing to disturb\\nmy equanimity, attempted, as those who consort with philosophers often\\nwill do, to quarrel with me. But, finding no material wherewith to\\nbuild a dispute in such fragments as \\xef\\xbf\\xbdAh!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\xef\\xbf\\xbdHem!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\xef\\xbf\\xbdWallah!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd he hinted desperate\\nintentions against the boy Mohammed. When, however, the youth appeared,\\nwith even more jauntiness of mien than usual, Ali bin Ya Sin lost\\nheart, brushed by him, mounted his mule, and, doubtless cursing us \\xef\\xbf\\xbdunder\\nthe tongue,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd rode away, frowning viciously, with his heels playing upon\\nthe beast\\xef\\xbf\\xbds ribs.\\n</p><p>Mohammed had been delayed, he said, by the difficulty of finding asses.\\nWe were now to mount for \\xef\\xbf\\xbdthe Throwing,[FN#2]\\xef\\xbf\\xbd as a preliminary to which we\\nwashed \\xef\\xbf\\xbdwith seven waters\\xef\\xbf\\xbd the seven pebbles brought from Muzdalifah, and\\nbound them in our Ihrams. Our first destination was the entrance to the\\nwestern end of the long line which composes the Muna village. We found\\na swarming crowd in the narrow road opposite the \\xef\\xbf\\xbdJamrat al-Akabah,[FN#3]\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\nor, as it is vulgarly called, the Shaytan al-Kabir\\xef\\xbf\\xbdthe \\xef\\xbf\\xbdGreat Devil.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd These\\nnames distinguish it from another pillar, the \\xef\\xbf\\xbdWusta,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd or \\xef\\xbf\\xbdCentral Place,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd (of\\nstoning,) built in the middle of Muna, and a third at the eastern end,\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbdAl-Aula,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd or the \\xef\\xbf\\xbdFirst Place.[FN#4]\\xef\\xbf\\xbd \\tThe \\xef\\xbf\\xbdShaytan al-Kabir\\xef\\xbf\\xbd is a dwarf buttress\\nof rude\\n</p><p>[p.204] masonry, about eight feet high by two and a half broad, placed\\nagainst a rough wall of stones at the Meccan entrance to Muna. As the\\nceremony of \\xef\\xbf\\xbdRamy,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd or Lapidation, must be performed on the first day by\\nall pilgrims between sunrise and sunset, and as the fiend was malicious\\nenough to appear in a rugged Pass,[FN#5] the crowd makes the place\\ndangerous. On one side of the road, which is not forty feet broad,\\nstood a row of shops belonging principally to barbers. On the other\\nside is the rugged wall against which the pillar stands, with a chevaux\\nde frise of Badawin and naked boys. The narrow space was crowded with\\npilgrims, all struggling like drowning men to approach as near as\\npossible to the Devil; it would have been easy to run over the heads of\\nthe mass. Amongst them were horsemen with rearing chargers. Badawin on\\nwild camels, and grandees on mules and asses, with outrunners, were\\nbreaking a way by assault and battery. I had read Ali Bey\\xef\\xbf\\xbds\\nself-felicitations upon escaping this place with \\xef\\xbf\\xbdonly two wounds in the\\nleft leg,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd and I had duly provided myself with a hidden dagger. The\\nprecaution was not useless. Scarcely had my donkey entered the crowd\\nthan he was overthrown by a dromedary, and I found myself under the\\nstamping and roaring beast\\xef\\xbf\\xbds stomach. Avoiding being trampled upon by a\\njudicious use of the knife, I lost no time in escaping from a place so\\nignobly dangerous. Some Moslem travellers assert, in proof of the\\nsanctity of the spot, that no Moslem is ever killed here: Meccans\\nassured me that accidents are by no means rare.\\n</p><p>Presently the boy Mohammed fought his way out of the crowd with a\\nbleeding nose. We both sat down upon a bench before a barber\\xef\\xbf\\xbds booth,\\nand, schooled by adversity,\\n</p><p>[p.205] awaited with patience an opportunity. Finding an opening, we\\napproached within about five cubits of the place, and holding each\\nstone between the thumb and the forefinger[FN#6] of the right hand, we\\ncast it at the pillar, exclaiming, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdIn the name of Allah, and Allah is\\nAlmighty! (I do this) in Hatred of the Fiend and to his Shame.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd After\\nwhich came the Tahlil and the \\xef\\xbf\\xbdSana,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd or praise to Allah. The seven stones\\nbeing duly thrown, we retired, and entering the barber\\xef\\xbf\\xbds booth, took our\\nplaces upon one of the earthern benches around it. This was the time to\\nremove the Ihram or pilgrim\\xef\\xbf\\xbds garb, and to return to Ihlal, the normal\\nstate of Al-Islam. The barber shaved our heads,[FN#7] and, after\\ntrimming our beards and cutting our nails, made us repeat these words: \\xef\\xbf\\xbdI\\npurpose loosening my Ihram according to the Practice of the Prophet,\\nWhom may Allah bless and preserve! O Allah, make unto me in every Hair,\\na Light, a Purity, and a generous Reward! In the name of Allah, and\\nAllah is Almighty!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd At the conclusion of his labour, the barber politely\\naddressed to us a \\xef\\xbf\\xbdNa\\xef\\xbf\\xbdiman\\xef\\xbf\\xbdPleasure to you!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd To which we as ceremoniously\\nreplied, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdAllah give thee pleasure!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd We had no clothes with us, but we\\ncould use our cloths to cover our heads, and slippers to defend our\\nfeet from the fiery sun; and we now could safely twirl our mustachios\\nand stroke our beards\\xef\\xbf\\xbdplacid enjoyments of which we had been deprived by\\nthe\\n</p><p>[p.206] Laws of Pilgrimage. After resting about an hour in the booth,\\nwhich, though crowded with sitting customers, was delightfully cool\\ncompared with the burning glare of the road, we mounted our asses, and\\nat eleven A.M. we started Meccah-wards.\\n</p><p>This return from Muna to Meccah is called Al-Nafr, or the Flight[FN#8]:\\nwe did not fail to keep our asses at speed, with a few halts to refresh\\nourselves with gugglets of water. There was nothing remarkable in the\\nscene: our ride in was a repetition of our ride out. In about half an\\nhour we entered the city, passing through that classical locality\\ncalled \\xef\\xbf\\xbdBatn Kuraysh,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd which was crowded with people, and then we repaired\\nto the boy Mohammed\\xef\\xbf\\xbds house for the purpose of bathing and preparing to\\nvisit the Ka\\xef\\xbf\\xbdabah.\\n</p><p>Shortly after our arrival, the youth returned home in a state of\\nexcitement, exclaiming, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdRise, Effendi! dress and follow me!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd The Ka\\xef\\xbf\\xbdabah,\\nthough open, would for a time be empty, so that we should escape the\\ncrowd. My pilgrim\\xef\\xbf\\xbds garb, which had not been removed, was made to look\\nneat and somewhat Indian, and we sallied forth together without loss of\\ntime.\\n</p><p>A crowd had gathered round the Ka\\xef\\xbf\\xbdabah, and I had no wish to stand\\nbareheaded and barefooted in the midday September sun. At the cry of\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbdOpen a path for the Haji who would enter the House,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd the gazers made way.\\nTwo stout Meccans, who stood below the door, raised me in their arms,\\nwhilst a third drew me from above into the building. At the entrance I\\nwas accosted by several officials, dark-looking Meccans, of whom the\\nblackest and plainest was a youth of the Benu Shaybah family,[FN#9]\\n</p><p>[p.207] the sangre-azul of Al-Hijaz. He held in his hand the huge\\nsilver-gilt padlock of the Ka\\xef\\xbf\\xbdabah,[FN#10] and presently taking his seat\\nupon a kind of wooden press in the left corner of the hall, he\\nofficially inquired my name, nation, and other particulars. The replies\\nwere satisfactory, and the boy Mohammed was authoritatively ordered to\\nconduct me round the building, and to recite the prayers. I will not\\ndeny that, looking at the windowless walls, the officials at the door,\\nand the crowd of excited fanatics below\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n</p><p>\\xef\\xbf\\xbdAnd the place death, considering who I was,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd[FN#11] my feelings were of\\nthe trapped-rat description, acknowledged by the immortal nephew of his\\nuncle Perez. This did not, however, prevent my carefully observing the\\nscene during our long prayers, and making a rough plan with a pencil\\nupon my white Ihram.\\n</p><p>Nothing is more simple than the interior of this celebrated building.\\nThe pavement, which is level with the ground, is composed of slabs of\\nfine and various coloured marbles, mostly, however, white, disposed\\nchequerwise. The walls, as far as they can be seen, are of the same\\nmaterial, but the pieces are irregularly shaped, and many of them are\\nengraved with long inscriptions in the Suls and other modern\\ncharacters. The upper part of the walls, together with the ceiling, at\\nwhich it is considered disrespectful to look,[FN#12] are covered with\\nhandsome\\n</p><p>[p.208] red damask, flowered over with gold,[FN#13] and tucked up about\\nsix feet high, so as to be removed from pilgrims\\xef\\xbf\\xbd hands. The flat roof is\\nupheld by three cross-beams, whose shapes appear under the arras; they\\nrest upon the eastern and western walls, and are supported in the\\ncentre by three columns[FN#14] about twenty inches in diameter, covered\\nwith carved and ornamented aloes wood.[FN#15] At the Iraki corner there\\nis a dwarf door, called Bab al-Taubah (of Repentance).[FN#16] It leads\\ninto a narrow passage and to the staircase by which the servants ascend\\nto the roof: it is never opened except for working purposes. The \\xef\\xbf\\xbdAswad\\xef\\xbf\\xbd or\\n</p><p>[p.209] \\xef\\xbf\\xbdAs\\xef\\xbf\\xbdad[FN#17]\\xef\\xbf\\xbd corner is occupied by a flat-topped and\\nquadrant-shaped press or safe,[FN#18] in which at times is placed the\\nkey of the Ka\\xef\\xbf\\xbdabah.[FN#19] Both door and safe are of aloes wood. Between\\nthe columns, and about nine feet from the ground, ran bars of a metal\\nwhich I could not distinguish, and hanging to them were many lamps,\\nsaid to be of gold.\\n</p><p>Although there were in the Ka\\xef\\xbf\\xbdabah but a few attendants engaged in\\npreparing it for the entrance of pilgrims,[FN#20] the windowless stone\\nwalls and the choked-up door made it worse than the Piombi of Venice;\\nperspiration trickled in large drops, and I thought with horror what it\\nmust be when filled with a mass of furiously jostling and crushing\\nfanatics. Our devotions consisted of a two-bow prayer,[FN#21] followed\\nby long supplications at the Shami (West) corner, the Iraki (north)\\nangle, the Yamani (south), and, lastly, opposite the southern third of\\nthe back wall.[FN#22] These concluded, I returned to the door, where\\npayment is made. The boy Mohammed told me that the total expense would\\nbe seven dollars. At the same time he had been indulging aloud in his\\nfavourite rhodomontade, boasting of my greatness, and had declared me\\nto be an Indian pilgrim, a race still supposed at\\n</p><p>[p.210] Meccah to be made of gold.[FN#23] When seven dollars were\\ntendered, they were rejected with instance. Expecting something of the\\nkind, I had been careful to bring no more than eight. Being pulled and\\ninterpellated by half a dozen attendants, my course was to look stupid,\\nand to pretend ignorance of the language. Presently the Shaybah youth\\nbethought him of a contrivance. Drawing forth from the press the key of\\nthe Ka\\xef\\xbf\\xbdabah, he partly bared it of its green-silk gold-lettered\\netui,[FN#24] and rubbed a golden knob quartrefoil-shaped upon my eyes,\\nin order to brighten them. I submitted to the operation with a good\\ngrace, and added a dollar\\xef\\xbf\\xbdmy last\\xef\\xbf\\xbdto the former offering. The Sharif\\nreceived it with a hopeless glance, and, to my satisfaction, would not\\nput forth his hand to be kissed. Then the attendants began to demand\\nvails I replied by opening my empty pouch. When let down from the door\\nby the two brawny Meccans, I was expected to pay them, and accordingly\\nappointed to meet them at the boy Mohammed\\xef\\xbf\\xbds house; an arrangement to\\nwhich they grumblingly assented. When delivered from these troubles, I\\nwas congratulated by my sharp companion thus: \\xef\\xbf\\xbdWallah, Effendi! thou hast\\nescaped well! some men have left their skins behind.[FN#25]\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n</p><p>[p.211] All pilgrims do not enter the Ka\\xef\\xbf\\xbdabah[FN#26]; and many refuse to\\ndo so for religious reasons. Omar Effendi, for instance, who never\\nmissed a pilgrimage, had never seen the interior.[FN#27] Those who\\ntread the hallowed floor are bound, among many other things, never\\nagain to walk barefooted, to take up fire with the fingers, or to tell\\nlies. Most really conscientious men cannot afford the luxuries of\\nslippers, tongs, and truth. So thought Thomas, when offered the apple\\nwhich would give him the tongue which cannot lie:\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n</p><p>\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\xef\\xbf\\xbdMy tongue is mine ain,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd true Thomas said.\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbdA gudely gift ye wad gie to me!\\nI neither dought to buy nor sell\\nAt fair or tryst, where I may be,\\nI dought neither speak to prince or peer,\\nNor ask of grace from fair ladye!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n</p><p>Amongst the Hindus I have met with men who have proceeded upon a\\npilgrimage to Dwarka, and yet who would not receive the brand of the\\ngod, because lying would then be forbidden to them. A confidential\\nservant of a friend in Bombay na\\xef\\xbf\\xbdvely declared that he had not been\\nmarked, as the act would have ruined him. There is a sad truth in what\\nhe said: Lying to the Oriental is meat and drink, and the roof that\\nshelters him.\\n</p><p>The Ka\\xef\\xbf\\xbdabah had been dressed in her new attire when we entered.[FN#28]\\nThe covering, however, instead of being\\n</p><p>[p.212] secured at the bottom to the metal rings in the basement, was\\ntucked up by ropes from the roof, and depended over each face in two\\nlong tongues. It was of a brilliant black, and the Hizam\\xef\\xbf\\xbdthe zone or\\ngolden band running round the upper portion of the building\\xef\\xbf\\xbdas well as\\nthe Burka (face-veil), were of dazzling brightness.[FN#29]\\n\\tThe origin of this custom must be sought in the ancient\\npractice of typifying the church visible by a virgin or bride. The poet\\nAbd al-Rahim al Bura\\xef\\xbf\\xbdi, in one of his Gnostic effusions, has embodied the\\nidea:\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n([Arabic])\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbdAnd Meccah\\xef\\xbf\\xbds bride (i.e. the Ka\\xef\\xbf\\xbdabah) is displayed\\nwith (miraculous) signs.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n</p><p>This idea doubtless led to the face-veil, the covering, and the\\nguardianship of eunuchs.\\n</p><p>The Meccan temple was first dressed as a mark of\\n</p><p>[p.213] honour by Tobba the Himyarite when he Judaized.[FN#30] If we\\naccept this fact, which is vouched for by Oriental history, we are led\\nto the conclusion that the children of Israel settled at Meccah had\\nconnected the temple with their own faith, and, as a corollary, that\\nthe prophet of Al-Islam introduced their apocryphal traditions into his\\ncreed. The pagan Arabs did not remove the coverings: the old and torn\\nKiswah was covered with a new cloth, and the weight threatened to crush\\nthe building.[FN#31] From the time of Kusay, the Ka\\xef\\xbf\\xbdabah was veiled by\\nsubscription, till Abu Rabi\\xef\\xbf\\xbdat al-Mughayrah bin Abdullah, who, having\\nacquired great wealth by commerce, offered to provide the Kiswah on\\nalternate years, and thereby gained the name of Al-adil. The Prophet\\npreferred a covering of fine Yaman cloth, and directed the expense to\\nbe defrayed by the Bayt al-Mal, or public treasury. Omar chose Egyptian\\nlinen, ordering the Kiswah to be renewed every year, and the old\\ncovering to be distributed among the pilgrims. In the reign of Osman,\\nthe Ka\\xef\\xbf\\xbdabah was twice clothed, in winter and summer. For the former\\nseason, it received a Kamis, or Tobe (shirt) of brocade; with an Izar,\\nor veil: for the latter a suit of fine linen. Mu\\xef\\xbf\\xbdawiyah at first supplied\\nlinen and brocade; he afterwards exchanged the former for striped Yaman\\nstuff, and ordered Shaybah bin Osman to strip the Ka\\xef\\xbf\\xbdabah and to perfume\\nthe walls with Khaluk. Shaybah divided the old Kiswah among the\\npilgrims, and Abdullah bin Abbas did not object to this\\ndistribution.[FN#32] The Caliph Ma\\xef\\xbf\\xbdamun (9th century) ordered\\n</p><p>[p.214] the dress to be changed three times a year. In his day it was\\nred brocade on the 10th Muharram; fine linen on the 1st Rajab; and\\nwhite brocade on the 1st Shawwal. At last he was informed that the veil\\napplied on the 10th of Muharram was too closely followed by the red\\nbrocade in the next month, and that it required renewing on the 1st of\\nShawwal. This he ordered to be done. Al-Mutawakkil (ninth century),\\nwhen informed that the dress was spoiled by pilgrims, at first ordered\\ntwo to be given and the brocade shirt to be let down as far as the\\npavement: at last he sent a new veil every two months. During the\\nCaliphat of the Abbasides this investiture came to signify sovereignty\\nin Al-Hijaz, which passed alternately from Baghdad to Egypt and\\nAl-Yaman. In Al-Idrisi\\xef\\xbf\\xbds time (twel[f]th century A.D.) the Kiswah was\\ncomposed of black silk, and renewed every year by the Caliph of\\nBaghdad. Ibn Jubayr writes that it was green and gold. The Kiswah\\nremained with Egypt when Sultan Kalaun[FN#33] (thirteenth century A.D.)\\nconveyed the rents of two villages, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdBaysus\\xef\\xbf\\xbd and \\xef\\xbf\\xbdSindbus,[FN#34]\\xef\\xbf\\xbd to the\\nexpense of providing an outer black and an inner red curtain for the\\nKa\\xef\\xbf\\xbdabah, with hangings for the Prophet\\xef\\xbf\\xbds tomb at Al-Madinah. When the Holy\\nLand fell under the power of Osmanli, Sultan Salim ordered the Kiswah\\nto be black; and his son Sultan Sulayman the Magnificent (sixteenth\\n</p><p>[p.215] century A.D.), devoted considerable sums to the purpose. The\\nKiswah was afterwards renewed at the accession of each Sultan. And the\\nWahhabis, during the first year of their conquest, covered the Ka\\xef\\xbf\\xbdabah\\nwith a red Kiswah of the same stuff as the fine Arabian Aba or cloak,\\nand made at Al-Hasa.\\n</p><p>The Kiswah is now worked at a cotton manufactory called Al-Khurunfish,\\nof the Tumn Bab al-Sha\\xef\\xbf\\xbdariyah, Cairo. It is made by a hereditary family,\\ncalled the Bayt al-Sadi, and, as the specimen in my possession proves,\\nit is a coarse tissue of silk and cotton mixed. The Kiswah is composed\\nof eight pieces\\xef\\xbf\\xbdtwo for each face of the Ka\\xef\\xbf\\xbdabah\\xef\\xbf\\xbdthe seams being concealed by\\nthe Hizam, a broad band, which at a distance looks like gold; it is\\nlined with white calico, and is supplied with cotton ropes. Anciently\\nit is said all the Koran was interwoven into it. Now, it is inscribed\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbdVerily, the First of Houses founded for Mankind (to worship in) is that\\nat Bekkah[FN#35]; blessed and a Direction to all Creatures\\xef\\xbf\\xbd; together\\nwith seven chapters, namely, the Cave, Mariam, the Family of Amran,\\nRepentance, T.H. with Y.S. and Tabarak. The character is that called\\nTumar, the largest style of Eastern calligraphy, legible from a\\nconsiderable distance.[FN#36] The Hizam is a band about two feet broad,\\nand surrounding the Ka\\xef\\xbf\\xbdabah at two-thirds of its height. It is divided\\ninto four pieces, which are sewn together. On the first and second is\\ninscribed the \\xef\\xbf\\xbdThrone verslet,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd and on the third and fourth the titles of\\nthe reigning Sultan. These inscriptions are, like the Burka, or door\\ncurtain, gold worked into red silk, by the Bayt al-Sadi. When the\\nKiswah is ready at Khurunfish, it is carried in\\n</p><p>[p.216] procession to the Mosque Al-Hasanayn, where it is lined, sewn,\\nand prepared for the journey.[FN#37]\\n</p><p>After quitting the Ka\\xef\\xbf\\xbdabah, I returned home exhausted, and washed with\\nhenna and warm water, to mitigate the pain of the sun-scalds upon my\\narms, shoulders, and breast. The house was empty, all the Turkish\\npilgrims being still at Muna; and the Kabirah\\xef\\xbf\\xbdthe old lady\\xef\\xbf\\xbdreceived me with\\npeculiar attention. I was ushered into an upper room, whose teak\\nwainscotings, covered with Cufic and other inscriptions, large carpets,\\nand ample Diwans, still showed a sort of ragged splendour. The family\\nhad \\xef\\xbf\\xbdseen better days,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd the Sharif Ghalib having confiscated three of its\\nhouses; but it is still proud, and cannot merge the past into the\\npresent. In the \\xef\\xbf\\xbddrawing-room,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd which the Turkish colonel occupied when at\\nMeccah, the Kabirah supplied me with a pipe, coffee, cold water, and\\nbreakfast. I won her heart by praising the graceless boy Mohammed; like\\nall mothers, she dearly loved the scamp of the family. When he entered,\\nand saw his maternal parent standing near me, with only the end of her\\nveil drawn over her mouth, he began to scold her with divers\\ninsinuations. \\xef\\xbf\\xbdSoon thou wilt sit amongst the men in the hall!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd he\\nexclaimed. \\xef\\xbf\\xbdO, my son,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd rejoined the Kabirah, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdfear Allah: thy mother is in\\nyears!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\xef\\xbf\\xbdand truly she was so, being at least fifty. \\xef\\xbf\\xbdA-a-h\\xef\\xbf\\xbd sneered the youth,\\nwho had formed, as boys of the world must do, or appear to do, a very\\nlow estimate of the sex. The old lady understood the drift of the\\nexclamation, and departed with a half-laughing \\xef\\xbf\\xbdMay Allah disappoint thee!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\nShe soon, however, returned, bringing me water for ablution; and having\\nheard that I had not yet sacrificed a sheep at Muna, enjoined me to\\nreturn and perform without delay that important rite.\\n</p><p>[p.217]After resuming our laical toilette, and dressing gaily for the\\ngreat festival, we mounted our asses about the cool of the afternoon,\\nand, returning to Muna, we found the tent full of visitors. Ali ibn Ya\\nSin, the Zemzemi, had sent me an amphora of holy water, and the carrier\\nwas awaiting the customary dollar. With him were several Meccans, one\\nof whom spoke excellent Persian. We sat down, and chatted together for\\nan hour; and I afterwards learned from the boy Mohammed, that all had\\npronounced me to be an \\xef\\xbf\\xbdAjami.\\n</p><p>After their departure we debated about the victim, which is only a\\nSunnat, or practice of the Prophet.[FN#38] It is generally sacrificed\\nimmediately after the first lapidation, and we had already been guilty\\nof delay. Under these circumstances, and considering the meagre\\ncondition of my purse, I would not buy a sheep, but contented myself\\nwith watching my neighbours. They gave themselves great trouble,\\nespecially a large party of Indians pitched near us, to buy the victim\\ncheap; but the Badawin were not less acute, and he was happy who paid\\nless than a dollar and a quarter. Some preferred contributing to buy a\\nlean ox. None but the Sharif and the principal dignitaries slaughtered\\ncamels. The pilgrims dragged their victims to a smooth rock near the\\nAkabah, above which stands a small open pavilion, whose sides, red with\\nfresh blood, showed that the prince and his attendants had been busy at\\nsacrifice. [FN#39] Others stood before their tents, and, directing the\\nvictim\\xef\\xbf\\xbds face towards the Ka\\xef\\xbf\\xbdabah, cut its throat, ejaculating, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdBismillah!\\nAllaho Akbar[FN#40]\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n</p><p>[p.218] The boy Mohammed sneeringly directed my attention to the\\nIndians, who, being a mild race, had hired an Arab butcher to do the\\ndeed of blood; and he aroused all Shaykh Nur\\xef\\xbf\\xbds ire by his taunting\\ncomments upon the chicken-heartedness of the men of Hind. It is\\nconsidered a meritorious act to give away the victim without eating any\\nportion of its flesh. Parties of Takruri might be seen sitting\\nvulture-like, contemplating the sheep and goats; and no sooner was the\\nsignal given, than they fell upon the bodies, and cut them up without\\nremoving them. The surface of the valley soon came to resemble the\\ndirtiest slaughter-house, and my prescient soul drew bad auguries for\\nthe future.\\n</p><p>We had spent a sultry afternoon in the basin of Muna, which is not\\nunlike a volcanic crater, an Aden closed up at the seaside. Towards\\nnight the occasional puffs of Samum ceased, and through the air of\\ndeadly stillness a mass of purple nimbus, bisected by a thin grey line\\nof mist-cloud, rolled down upon us from the Taif hills. When darkness\\ngave the signal, most of the pilgrims pressed towards the square in\\nfront of the Muna Mosque, to enjoy the pyrotechnics and the discharge\\nof cannon. But during the spectacle came on a windy storm, whose\\nlightnings, flashing their fire from pole to pole paled the rockets;\\nand whose thunderings, re-echoed by the rocky hills, dumbed the puny\\nartillery of man. We were disappointed in our hopes of rain. A few huge\\ndrops pattered upon the plain and sank into its thirsty entrails; all\\nthe rest was thunder and lightning, dust-clouds and whirlwind.\\n</p><p>[FN#1] Even pitching ground here is charged to pilgrims.\\n[FN#2] Some authorities advise that this rite of \\xef\\xbf\\xbdRamy\\xef\\xbf\\xbd be performed on\\nfoot.\\n[FN#3] The word \\xef\\xbf\\xbdJamrah\\xef\\xbf\\xbd is applied to the place of stoning, as well as to\\nthe stones.\\n[FN#4] These numbers mark the successive spots where the Devil, in the\\nshape of an old Shaykh, appeared to Adam, Abraham, and Ishmael, and was\\ndriven back by the simple process taught by Gabriel, of throwing stones\\nabout the size of a bean.\\n[FN#5] I borrow this phrase from Ali Bey, who, however, speaks more\\nlike an ignorant Catalonian than a learned Abbaside, when he calls the\\npillar \\xef\\xbf\\xbdLa Maison du Diable,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd and facetiously asserts that \\xef\\xbf\\xbdle diable a eu la\\nmalice de placer sa maison dans un lieu fort etroit qui n\\xef\\xbf\\xbda peut-etre pas\\n34 pieds de large.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n[FN#6] Some hold the pebble as a schoolboy does a marble, others\\nbetween the thumb and forefinger extended, others shoot them from the\\nthumb knuckle, and most men consult their own convenience.\\n[FN#7] The barber removed all my hair. Hanifis shave at least a quarter\\nof the head, Shafe\\xef\\xbf\\xbdis a few hairs on the right side. The prayer is, as\\nusual, differently worded, some saying, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdO Allah this my Forelock is in\\nThy Hand, then grant me for every Hair a Light on Resurrection-day, by\\nThy Mercy O most Merciful of the Merciful!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd I remarked that the hair was\\nallowed to lie upon the ground, whereas strict Moslems, with that\\nreverence for man\\xef\\xbf\\xbds body\\xef\\xbf\\xbdthe Temple of the Supreme\\xef\\xbf\\xbdwhich characterizes their\\ncreed, carefully bury it in the earth.\\n[FN#8] This word is confounded with \\xef\\xbf\\xbdDafa\\xef\\xbf\\xbd by many Moslem authors. Some\\nspeak of the Nafr from Arafat to Muzdalifah and the Dafa from\\nMuzdalifah to Muna. I have used the words as my Mutawwif used them.\\n[FN#9] They keep the keys of the House. In my day the head of the\\nfamily was \\xef\\xbf\\xbdShaykh Ahmad.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n[FN#10] In Ibn Jubayr\\xef\\xbf\\xbds time this large padlock was of gold. It is said\\npopularly that none but the Benu Shaybah can open it; a minor miracle,\\ndoubtless proceeding from the art of some Eastern Hobbs or Bramah.\\n[FN#11] However safe a Christian might be at Meccah, nothing could\\npreserve him from the ready knives of enraged fanatics if detected in\\nthe House. The very idea is pollution to a Moslem.\\n[FN#12] I do not known the origin of this superstition; but it would be\\nunsafe for a pilgrim to look fixedly at the Ka\\xef\\xbf\\xbdabah ceiling. Under the\\narras I was told is a strong planking of Saj, or Indian teak, and above\\nit a stuccoed Sath, or flat roof.\\n[FN#13] Exactly realising the description of our English bard:\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbdGoodly arras of great majesty,\\nWoven with gold and silk so close and nere,\\nThat the rich metal lurked privily,\\nAs feigning to be hid from envious eye.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n[FN#14] Ibn Jubayr mentions three columns of teak. Burckhardt and Ali\\nBey, two. In Al-Fasi\\xef\\xbf\\xbds day there were four. The Kuraysh erected six\\ncolumns in double row. Generally the pillars have been three in number.\\n[FN#15] This wood, which has been used of old to ornament sacred\\nbuildings in the East, is brought to Meccah in great quantities by\\nMalay and Java pilgrims. The best kind is known by its oily appearance\\nand a \\xef\\xbf\\xbdfizzing\\xef\\xbf\\xbd sound in fire; the cunning vendors easily supply it with\\nthese desiderata.\\n[FN#16] Ibn Jubayr calls it Bab al-Rahmah.\\n[FN#17] The Hajar al-Aswad is also called Al-As\\xef\\xbf\\xbdad, or the Propitious.\\n[FN#18] Here, in Ibn Jubayr\\xef\\xbf\\xbds time, stood two boxes full of Korans.\\n[FN#19] The key is sometimes placed in the hands of a child of the\\nhouse of Shaybah, who sits in state, with black slaves on both sides.\\n[FN#20] In Ibn Jubayr\\xef\\xbf\\xbds day the Ka\\xef\\xbf\\xbdabah was opened with more ceremony. The\\nladder was rolled up to the door, and the chief of the Benu Shaybah,\\nascending it, was covered by attendants with a black veil from head to\\nfoot, whilst he opened the padlock. Then, having kissed the threshold,\\nhe entered, shut the door behind him, and prayed two Rukats; after\\nwhich, all the Benu Shaybah, and, lastly, the vulgar were admitted. In\\nthese day the veil is obsolete. The Shaykh enters the Ka\\xef\\xbf\\xbdabah alone,\\nperfumes it and prays; the pilgrims are then admitted en masse; and the\\nstyle in which the eunuchs handle their quarter-staves forms a scene\\nmore animated than decorous.\\n[FN#21] Some pray four instead of two bows.\\n[FN#22] Burckhardt erroneously says, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdin every corner.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n[FN#23] These Indians are ever in extremes, paupers or millionaires,\\nand, like all Moslems, the more they pay at Meccah the higher becomes\\ntheir character and religious titles. A Turkish Pasha seldom squanders\\nas much money as does a Moslem merchant from the far East. Khudabakhsh,\\nthe Lahore shawl-dealer, owned to having spent 800l. in feastings and\\npresents. He appeared to consider that sum a trifle, although, had a\\ndebtor carried off one tithe of it, his health would have been\\nseriously affected.\\n[FN#24] The cover of the key is made, like Abraham\\xef\\xbf\\xbds veil, of three\\ncolours, red, black or green. It is of silk, embroidered with golden\\nletters, and upon it are written the Bismillah, the name of the\\nreigning Sultan, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdBag of the key of the holy Ka\\xef\\xbf\\xbdabah,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd and a verselet from\\nthe \\xef\\xbf\\xbdFamily of Amran\\xef\\xbf\\xbd (Koran, ch. 3). It is made, like the Kiswah, at\\nKhurunfish, a place that will be noticed below.\\n[FN#25] \\xef\\xbf\\xbdEcorches\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\xef\\xbf\\xbdpelati;\\xef\\xbf\\xbd the idea is common to most imaginative nations.\\n[FN#26] The same is the case at Al-Madinah; many religious men object\\non conscientious grounds to enter the Prophet\\xef\\xbf\\xbds mosque. The poet quoted\\nbelow made many visitations to Al-Madinah, but never could persuade\\nhimself to approach the tomb. The Esquire Carver saw two young Turks\\nwho had voluntarily had their eyes thrust out at Meccah as soon as they\\nhad seen the glory and visible sanctity of the tomb of Mohammed. I \\xef\\xbf\\xbddoubt\\nthe fact,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd which thus appears ushered in by a fiction.\\n[FN#27] I have not thought it necessary to go deep into the list of\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbdMuharramat,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd or actions forbidden to the pilgrim who has entered the\\nKa\\xef\\xbf\\xbdabah. They are numerous and meaningless.\\n[FN#28] The use of the feminine pronoun is explained below. When\\nunclothed, the Ka\\xef\\xbf\\xbdabah is called Uryanah (naked), in opposition to its\\nnormal state, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdMuhramah,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd or clad in Ihram. In Burckhardt\\xef\\xbf\\xbds time the house\\nremained naked for fifteen days; now the investiture is effected in a\\nfew hours.\\n[FN#29] The gold-embroidered curtain covering the Ka\\xef\\xbf\\xbdabah door is called\\nby the learned \\xef\\xbf\\xbdBurka al-Ka\\xef\\xbf\\xbdabah\\xef\\xbf\\xbd (the Ka\\xef\\xbf\\xbdabah\\xef\\xbf\\xbds face-veil), by the vulgar Burka\\nFatimah; they connect it in idea with the Prophet\\xef\\xbf\\xbds daughter.\\n[FN#30] The pyramids, it is said, were covered from base to summit with\\nyellow silk or satin.\\n[FN#31] At present the Kiswah, it need scarcely be said, does not cover\\nthe flat roof.\\n[FN#32] Ayishah also, when Shaybah proposed to bury the old Kiswah,\\nthat it might not be worn by the impure, directed him to sell it, and\\nto distribute the proceeds to the poor. The Meccans still follow the\\nfirst half, but neglect the other part of the order given by the \\xef\\xbf\\xbdMother\\nof the Moslems.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd Kazi Khan advises the proceeds of the sale being devoted\\nto the repairs of the temple. The \\xef\\xbf\\xbdSiraj al-Wahhaj\\xef\\xbf\\xbd positively forbids, as\\nsinful, the cutting, transporting, selling, buying, and placing it\\nbetween the leaves of the Koran. Kutb al-Din (from whom I borrow these\\nparticulars) introduces some fine and casuistic distinctions. In his\\nday, however, the Benu Shaybah claimed the old, after the arrival of\\nthe new Kiswah; and their right to it was admitted. To the present day\\nthey continue to sell it.\\n[FN#33] Some authors also mention a green Kiswah, applied by this\\nmonarch. Embroidered on it were certain verselets of the Koran, the\\nformula of the Moslem faith, and the names of the Prophet\\xef\\xbf\\xbds Companions.\\n[FN#34] Burckhardt says \\xef\\xbf\\xbdBysous\\xef\\xbf\\xbd and \\xef\\xbf\\xbdSandabeir.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n[FN#35] From the \\xef\\xbf\\xbdFamily of Amran\\xef\\xbf\\xbd (chap. 3). \\xef\\xbf\\xbdBekkah\\xef\\xbf\\xbd is \\xef\\xbf\\xbda place of crowding\\xef\\xbf\\xbd;\\nhence applied to Meccah generally. Some writers, however, limit it to\\nthe part of the city round the Harim.\\n[FN#36] It is larger than the suls. Admirers of Eastern calligraphy may\\nsee a \\xef\\xbf\\xbdBismillah,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd beautifully written in Tumar, on the wall of Sultan\\nMu\\xef\\xbf\\xbdayyad\\xef\\xbf\\xbds Mosque at Cairo.\\n[FN#37] Mr. Lane (Mod. Egypt. vol. iii. chap. 25) has given an ample\\nand accurate description of the Kiswah. I have added a few details,\\nderived from \\xef\\xbf\\xbdKhalil Effendi\\xef\\xbf\\xbd of Cairo, a professor of Arabic, and an\\nexcellent French scholar.\\n[FN#38] Those who omit the rite fast ten days; three during the\\npilgrimage season, and the remaining seven at some other time.\\n[FN#39] The camel is sacrificed by thrusting a pointed instrument into\\nthe interval between the sternum and the neck. This anomaly may be\\naccounted for by the thickness and hardness of the muscles of the\\nthroat.\\n[FN#40] It is strange that the accurate Burckhardt should make the\\nMoslem say, when slaughtering or sacrificing, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdIn the name of the most\\nMerciful God!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd As Mr. Lane justly observes, the attribute of mercy is\\nomitted on these occasions.\\n</p>\\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Chapter_XXXI._THE_THREE_DAYS_OF_DRYING_FLESH.\">Chapter XXXI.

The heat of\\nthe succeeding night rendered every effort to sleep abortive; and as\\nour little camp required a guard in a place so celebrated for\\nplunderers, I spent the greater part of the time sitting in the clear\\npure moon-light.[FN#1]\\n</p><p>After midnight we again repaired to the Devils, and, beginning with the\\nUla, or first pillar, at the Eastern extremity of Muna, threw at each,\\nseven stones (making a total of twenty-one), with the ceremonies before\\ndescribed.\\n</p><p>On Thursday (Sept. 15th, 1853), we arose before dawn, and prepared with\\na light breakfast for the fatigues of a climbing walk. After half an\\nhour spent in hopping from boulder to boulder, we arrived at a place\\nsituated on the lower declivity of the Jabal Sabir, the northern wall\\nof the Muna basin. Here is the Majarr al-Kabsh, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdthe Dragging-place of\\nthe Ram,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd a small, whitewashed square, divided\\n</p><p>[p.220] into two compartments. The first is entered by a few ragged\\nsteps in the south-east angle, which lead to an enclosure thirty feet\\nby fifteen. In the north-east corner is a block of granite (A), in\\nwhich a huge gash, several inches broad, some feet deep, and completely\\nsplitting the stone in knife-shape, notes the spot where Ibrahim\\xef\\xbf\\xbds blade\\nfell when the archangel Gabriel forbade him to slay Ismail his son. The\\nsecond compartment contains a diminutive hypogaeum (B). In this cave\\nthe patriarch sacrificed the victim, which gives the place a name. We\\ndescended by a flight of steps, and under the stifling ledge of rock\\nfound mats and praying-rugs, which, at this early hour, were not\\novercrowded. We followed the example of the patriarchs, and prayed a\\ntwo-bow prayer in each of the enclosures. After distributing the usual\\ngratification, we left the place, and proceeded to mount the hill, in\\nhope of seeing some of the apes said still to haunt the heights. These\\nanimals are supposed by the Meccans to have been Jews, thus transformed\\nfor having broken the Sabbath by hunting.[FN#2] They abound in the\\nelevated regions about Arafat and Taif, where they are caught by mixing\\nthe juice of the Asclepias and narcotics with dates and other sweet\\nbait.[FN#3] The Hijazi ape is a hideous cynocephalus, with small eyes\\nplaced close together, and almost hidden by a disproportionate snout; a\\ngreenish-brown coat, long arms, and a stern of lively pink, like fresh\\nmeat. They\\n</p><p>[p.221] are docile, and are said to be fond of spirituous liquors, and\\nto display an inordinate affection for women. Al-Mas\\xef\\xbf\\xbdudi tells about them\\na variety of anecdotes. According to him their principal use in Hind\\nand Chin was to protect kings from poison, by eating suspected dishes.\\nThe Badawin have many tales concerning them. It is universally believed\\nthat they catch and kill kites, by exposing the rosy portion of their\\npersons and concealing the rest; the bird pounces upon what appears to\\nbe raw meat, and presently finds himself viciously plucked alive.\\nThroughout Arabia an old story is told of them. A merchant was once\\nplundered during his absence by a troop of these apes; they tore open\\nhis bales, and, charmed with the scarlet hue of the Tarbushes, began\\napplying those articles of dress to uses quite opposite to their normal\\npurpose. The merchant was in despair, when his slave offered for a\\nconsideration to recover the goods. Placing himself in the front, like\\na fugleman to the ape-company, he went through a variety of man\\xef\\xbf\\xbduvres\\nwith a Tarbush, and concluded with throwing it far away. The recruits\\ncarefully imitated him, and the drill concluded with his firing a shot;\\nthe plunderers decamped and the caps were recovered.\\n</p><p>Failing to see any apes, we retired to the tent ere the sun waxed hot,\\nin anticipation of a terrible day. Nor were we far wrong. In addition\\nto the heat, we had swarms of flies, and the blood-stained earth began\\nto reek with noisome vapours. Nought moved in the air except kites and\\nvultures, speckling the deep blue sky: the denizens of earth seemed\\nparalysed by the fire from above. I spent the time between breakfast\\nand nightfall lying half-dressed upon a mat, moving round the tent-pole\\nto escape the glare, and watching my numerous neighbours, male and\\nfemale. The Indians were particularly kind, filling my pipe, offering\\ncooled water, and performing similar little offices. I repaid them with\\na supply of provisions,\\n</p><p>[p.222] which, at the Muna market-prices, these unfortunates could ill\\nafford.\\n</p><p>When the moon arose the boy Mohammed and I walked out into the town,\\nperformed our second lapidation,[FN#4] and visited the coffee-houses.\\nThe shops were closed early, but business was transacted in places of\\npublic resort till midnight. We entered the houses of numerous\\nacquaintances, who accosted my companion, and were hospitably welcomed\\nwith pipes and coffee. The first question always was, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdWho is this\\npilgrim?\\xef\\xbf\\xbd and more than once the reply, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdAn Afghan,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd elicited the language of\\nmy own country, which I could no longer speak. Of this phenomenon,\\nhowever, nothing was thought: many Afghans settled in India know not a\\nword of Pushtu, and even above the Passes many of the townspeople are\\nimperfectly\\n</p><p>[p.223] acquainted with it. The Meccans in consequence of their\\nextensive intercourse with strangers and habits of travelling, are\\nadmirable conversational linguists. They speak Arabic remarkably well,\\nand with a volubility surpassing the most lively of our continental\\nnations. Persian, Turkish, and Hindustani are generally known: and the\\nMutawwifs, who devote themselves to various races of pilgrims, soon\\nbecome masters of many languages.\\n</p><p>Returning homewards, we were called to a spot by the clapping of\\nhands[FN#5] and the loud sound of song. We found a crowd of Badawin\\nsurrounding a group engaged in their favourite occupation of dancing.\\nThe performance is wild in the extreme, resembling rather the hopping\\nof bears than the inspirations of Terpischore. The bystanders joined in\\nthe song; an interminable recitative, as usual, in the minor key,\\nand\\xef\\xbf\\xbdOrientals are admirable timists\\xef\\xbf\\xbdit sounded like one voice. The refrain\\nappeared to be\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbdLa Yayha! La Yayha!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\nto which no one could assign a meaning. At other times they sang\\nsomething intelligible. For instance:\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n[Arabic]\\nThat is to say,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n</p><p>\\xef\\xbf\\xbdOn the Great Festival-day at Muna I saw my lord.\\nI am a stranger amongst you, therefore pity me!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n</p><p>This couplet may have, like the puerilities of certain modern and\\nEuropean poets, an abstruse and mystical\\n</p><p>[p.224] meaning, to be discovered when the Arabs learn to write erudite\\nessays upon nursery rhymes. The style of saltation, called Rufayah,\\nrivalled the song. The dancers raised both arms above their heads,\\nbrandishing a dagger, pistol, or some other small weapon. They followed\\neach other by hops, on one or both feet, sometimes indulging in the\\nmost demented leaps; whilst the bystanders clapped with their palms a\\nmore enlivening measure. This I was told is especially their war-dance.\\nThey have other forms, which my eyes were not fated to see. Amongst the\\nBadawin of Al-Hijaz, unlike the Somali and other African races, the\\nsexes never mingle: the girls may dance together, but it would be\\ndisgraceful to perform in the company of men.\\n</p><p>After so much excitement we retired to rest, and slept soundly.\\n</p><p>On Friday, the 12th Zu\\xef\\xbf\\xbdl Hijjah, the camels appeared, according to order,\\nat early dawn, and they were loaded with little delay. We were anxious\\nto enter Meccah in time for the sermon, and I for one was eager to\\nescape the now pestilential air of Muna.\\n</p><p>Literally, the land stank. Five or six thousand animals had been slain\\nand cut up in this Devil\\xef\\xbf\\xbds Punch-bowl. I leave the reader to imagine the\\nrest. The evil might be avoided by building abattoirs, or, more easily\\nstill, by digging long trenches, and by ordering all pilgrims, under\\npain of mulct, to sacrifice in the same place. Unhappily, the spirit of\\nAl-Islam is opposed to these precautions of common sense,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\xef\\xbf\\xbdInshallah\\xef\\xbf\\xbd and\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbdKismat\\xef\\xbf\\xbd must take the place of prevention and of cure. And at Meccah, the\\nhead-quarters of the faith, a desolating attack of cholera is preferred\\nto the impiety of \\xef\\xbf\\xbdflying in the face of Providence,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd and the folly of\\nendeavouring to avert inevitable decrees.[FN#6]\\n</p><p>[p.225] Mounting our camels, and led by Mas\\xef\\xbf\\xbdud, we entered Muna by the\\neastern end, and from the litter threw the remaining twenty-one stones.\\nI could now see the principal lines of shops, and, having been led to\\nexpect a grand display of merchandise, was surprised to find only\\nmat-booths and sheds, stocked chiefly with provisions. The exit from\\nMuna was crowded, for many, like ourselves, were flying from the\\nrevolting scene. I could not think without pity of those whom religious\\nscruples detained another day and a half in this foul spot.\\n</p><p>After entering Meccah we bathed, and when the noon drew nigh we\\nrepaired to the Harim for the purpose of hearing the sermon. Descending\\nto the cloisters below the Bab al-Ziyadah, I stood wonder-struck by the\\nscene before me. The vast quadrangle was crowded with worshippers\\nsitting in long rows, and everywhere facing the central black tower:\\nthe showy colours of their dresses were not to be surpassed by a garden\\nof the most brilliant flowers, and such diversity of detail would\\nprobably not be seen massed together in any other building upon earth.\\nThe women, a dull and sombre-looking group, sat apart in their peculiar\\nplace. The Pasha stood on the roof of Zemzem, surrounded by guards in\\nNizam uniform. Where the principal Olema stationed themselves, the\\ncrowd was thicker; and in the more auspicious spots nought was to be\\nseen but a pavement of heads and shoulders. Nothing seemed to move but\\na few Darwayshes, who, censer in hand, sidled through the rows and\\nreceived the unsolicited alms of the Faithful. Apparently in the midst,\\nand raised above the crowd by the tall, pointed pulpit, whose gilt\\nspire flamed in the sun, sat the preacher, an old man with snowy beard.\\nThe style of head-dress\\n</p><p>[p.226] called Taylasan[FN#7] covered his turband, which was white as\\nhis robes,[FN#8] and a short staff supported his left hand.[FN#9]\\nPresently he arose, took the staff in his right hand, pronounced a few\\ninaudible words,[FN#10] and sat down again on one of the lower steps,\\nwhilst a Mu\\xef\\xbf\\xbdezzin, at the foot of the pulpit, recited the call to sermon.\\nThen the old man stood up and began to preach. As the majestic figure\\nbegan to exert itself there was a deep silence. Presently a general \\xef\\xbf\\xbdAmin\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\nwas intoned by the crowd at the conclusion of some long sentence. And\\nat last, towards the end of the sermon, every third or fourth word was\\nfollowed by the simultaneous rise and fall of thousands of voices.\\n</p><p>I have seen the religious ceremonies of many lands, but never\\xef\\xbf\\xbdnowhere\\xef\\xbf\\xbdaught\\nso solemn, so impressive as this.\\n</p><p>[FN#1] It is not safe to perform this ceremony at an early hour,\\nalthough the ritual forbids it being deferred after sunset. A crowd of\\nwomen, however, assembled at the Devils in the earlier part of the 11th\\nnight (our 10th); and these dames, despite the oriental modesty of\\nface-veils, attack a stranger with hands and stones as heartily as\\nEnglish hop-gatherers hasten to duck the Acteon who falls in their way.\\nHence, popular usage allows stones to be thrown by men until the\\nmorning prayers of the 11th Zu\\xef\\xbf\\xbdl Hijjah.\\n[FN#2] Traditions about these animals vary in the different parts of\\nArabia. At Aden, for instance, they are supposed to be a remnant of the\\nrebellious tribe of \\xef\\xbf\\xbdad. It is curious that the popular Arabic, like the\\nPersian names, Sa\\xef\\xbf\\xbdadan, Maymun, Shadi, &amp;c., &amp;c., are all expressive of (a\\nprobably euphuistic) \\xef\\xbf\\xbdpropitiousness.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n[FN#3] The Egyptians generally catch, train, and take them to the banks\\nof the Nile, where the \\xef\\xbf\\xbdKurayeati\\xef\\xbf\\xbd (ape-leader) is a popular character.\\n[FN#4] This ceremony, as the reader will have perceived, is performed\\nby the Shafe\\xef\\xbf\\xbdis on the 10th, the 11th, and the 12th of Zu\\xef\\xbf\\xbdl Hijjah. The\\nHanafis conclude their stoning on the 13th. The times vary with each\\nday, and differ considerably in religious efficacy. On the night of the\\n10th (our 9th), for instance, lapidation, according to some\\nauthorities, cannot take place; others permit it, with a sufficient\\nreason. Between the dawn and sunrise it is Makruh, or disapproved of.\\nBetween sunrise and the declination is the Sunnat-time, and therefore\\nthe best. From noon to sunset it is Mubah, or permissible: the same is\\nthe case with the night, if a cause exist. On the 11th and 12th of Zu\\xef\\xbf\\xbdl\\nHijjah lapidation is disapproved of from sunset to sunrise. The Sunnat\\nis from noon to sunset, and it is permissible at all other hours. The\\nnumber of stones thrown by the Shafe\\xef\\xbf\\xbdis, is 49, viz., 7 on the 10th day,\\n7 at each pillar (total 21) on the 11th day, and the same on the 12th\\nZu\\xef\\xbf\\xbdl Hijjah. The Hanafis also throw 21 stones on the 13th, which raises\\ntheir number to 70. The first 7 bits of granite must be collected at\\nMuzdalifah; the rest may be taken from the Muna valley; and all must be\\nwashed 7 times before being thrown. In throwing, the Hanafis attempt to\\napproach the pillar, if possible, standing within reach of it. Shafe\\xef\\xbf\\xbdis\\nmay stand at a greater distance, which should not, however, pass the\\nlimits of 5 cubits.\\n[FN#5] Here called Safk. It is mentioned by Herodotus, and known to\\nalmost every oriental people. The Badawin sometimes, though rarely, use\\na table or kettledrum. Yet, amongst the \\xef\\xbf\\xbdPardah,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd or miuscal modes of the\\nEast, we find the Hijazi ranking with the Isfahani and the Iraki.\\nSouthern Arabia has never been celebrated for producing musicians, like\\nthe banks of the Tigris to which we owe, besides castanets and cymbals,\\nthe guitar, the drum, and the lute, father of the modern harp. The name\\nof this instrument is a corruption of the Arabic \\xef\\xbf\\xbdAl-\\xef\\xbf\\xbdud\\xef\\xbf\\xbd ([Arabic text]),\\nthrough liuto and luth, into lute.\\n[FN#6] NOTE TO THIRD EDITION.\\xef\\xbf\\xbdSince this was written there have been two\\ndeadly epidemics, which began, it is reported, at Muna. The victims,\\nhowever, have never numbered 700,000, nor is \\xef\\xbf\\xbdeach pilgrim required to\\nsacrifice one animal at the shrine of Mohammed,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd(!) as we find it in\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbdCholera Prospects,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd by Tilbury Fox, M.D. (Hardwicke).\\n[FN#7] A scarf thrown over the head, with one end brought round under\\nthe chin and passed over the left shoulder composes the \\xef\\xbf\\xbdTaylasan.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n[FN#8] As late as Ibn Jubayr\\xef\\xbf\\xbds time the preacher was habited from head to\\nfoot in black; and two Mu\\xef\\xbf\\xbdezzins held black flags fixed in rings on both\\nsides of the pulpit, with the staves propped upon the first step.\\n[FN#9] Mr. Lane remarks, that the wooden sword is never held by the\\npreacher but in a country that has been won from infidels by Moslems.\\nBurckhardt more correctly traces the origin of the custom to the early\\ndays of Al-Islam, when the preachers found it necessary to be prepared\\nfor surprises. And all authors who, like Ibn Jubayr, described the\\nMeccan ceremonies, mention the sword or staff. The curious reader will\\nconsult this most accurate of Moslem travellers; and a perusal of the\\npages will show that anciently the sermon differed considerably from,\\nand was far more ceremonious than, the present Khutbah.\\n[FN#10] The words were \\xef\\xbf\\xbdPeace be upon ye! and the Mercy of Allah and His\\nBlessings!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n</p>\\n<h2><span id=\"Chapter_XXXII._LIFE_AT_MECCAH.2C_AND_UMRAH.2C_OR_THE_LITTLE_PILGRIMAGE.\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Chapter_XXXII._LIFE_AT_MECCAH,_AND_UMRAH,_OR_THE_LITTLE_PILGRIMAGE.\">Chapter XXXII.

The Badawin of\\nAl-Hijaz were, he said, in a ferment caused by the reports of the Holy\\nWar, want of money, and rumours of quarrels between the Sharif and the\\nPasha: already they spoke of an attack upon Jeddah. Shaykh Mas\\xef\\xbf\\xbdud, the\\ncamel man, from whom I parted on the best of terms, seriously advised\\nmy remaining at Meccah for some months even before proceeding to Sana\\xef\\xbf\\xbda.\\nOthers gave the same counsel. Briefly I saw that my star was not then\\nin the ascendant, and resolved to reserve myself for a more propitious\\nconjuncture by returning to Egypt.\\n</p><p>The Turkish colonel and I had become as friendly as two men ignoring\\neach other\\xef\\xbf\\xbds speech could be. He had derived benefit from some\\nprescription; but, like all his countrymen, he was pining to leave\\nMeccah.[FN#1] Whilst the\\n</p><p>[p.228] pilgrimage lasted, said they, no mal de pays came to trouble\\nthem; but, its excitement over, they could think of nothing but their\\nwives and children. Long-drawn faces and continual sighs evidenced\\nnostalgia. At last the house became a scene of preparation. Blue\\nchinaware and basketed bottles of Zemzem water appeared standing in\\nsolid columns, and pilgrims occupied themselves in hunting for\\nmementoes of Meccah; ground-plans; combs, balm, henna, tooth-sticks;\\naloes-wood, turquoises, coral, and mother-o\\xef\\xbf\\xbd-pearl rosaries; shreds of\\nKiswah-cloth and fine Abas, or cloaks of camels\\xef\\xbf\\xbd-wool. It was not safe to\\nmount the stairs without shouting \\xef\\xbf\\xbdTarik\\xef\\xbf\\xbd (Out of the way!) at every step,\\non peril of meeting face to face some excited fair.[FN#2] The lower\\nfloor was crowded with provision-vendors; and the staple article of\\nconversation seemed to be the chance of a steamer from Jeddah to Suez.\\n</p><p>Weary of the wrangling and chaffering of the hall below, I had\\npersuaded my kind hostess, in spite of the surly skeleton her brother,\\npartially to clear out a small store-room in the first floor, and to\\nabandon it to me between the hours of ten and four. During the heat of\\nthe day clothing is unendurable at Meccah. The city is so \\xef\\xbf\\xbdcompacted\\ntogether\\xef\\xbf\\xbd by hills, that even the Samum can scarcely sweep it; the heat\\nreverberated by the bare rocks is intense, and the normal atmosphere of\\nan Eastern town communicates a faint lassitude to the body and\\nirritability to the mind. The houses being unusually strong and\\nwell-built, might by some art of thermantidote be rendered cool enough\\nin the hottest weather:\\n</p><p>[p.229] they are now ovens.[FN#3] It was my habit to retire immediately\\nafter the late breakfast to the little room upstairs, to sprinkle it\\nwith water, and to lie down on a mat. In the few precious moments of\\nprivacy notes were committed to paper, but one eye was ever fixed on\\nthe door. Sometimes a patient would interrupt me, but a doctor is far\\nless popular in Al-Hijaz than in Egypt. The people, being more healthy,\\nhave less faith in physic: Shaykh Mas\\xef\\xbf\\xbdud and his son had never tasted in\\ntheir lives aught more medicinal than green dates and camel\\xef\\xbf\\xbds milk.\\nOccasionally the black slave-girls came into the room, asking if the\\npilgrim wanted a pipe or a cup of coffee: they generally retired in a\\nstate of delight, attempting vainly to conceal with a corner of\\ntattered veil a grand display of ivory consequent upon some small and\\ninnocent facetiousness. The most frequent of my visitors was Abdullah,\\nthe Kabirah\\xef\\xbf\\xbds eldest son. This melancholy Jacques had joined our caravan\\nat Al-Hamra, on the\\n</p><p>[p.230] Yambu\\xef\\xbf\\xbd road, accompanied us to Al-Madinah, lived there, and\\njourneyed to Meccah with the Syrian pilgrimage; yet he had not once\\ncome to visit me or to see his brother, the boy Mohammed. When gently\\nreproached for this omission, he declared it to be his way\\xef\\xbf\\xbdthat he never\\ncalled upon strangers until sent for. He was a perfect Saudawi\\n(melancholist) in mind, manners, and personal appearance, and this\\nclass of humanity in the East is almost as uncomfortable to the\\nhousehold as the idiot of Europe. I was frequently obliged to share my\\nmeals with him, as his mother\\xef\\xbf\\xbdthough most filially and reverentially\\nentreated\\xef\\xbf\\xbdwould not supply him with breakfast two hours after the proper\\ntime, or with a dinner served up forty minutes before the rest of the\\nhousehold. Often, too, I had to curb, by polite deprecation, the\\nimpetuosity of the fiery old Kabirah\\xef\\xbf\\xbds tongue. Thus Abdullah and I became\\nfriends, after a fashion. He purchased several little articles\\nrequired, and never failed to pass hours in my closet, giving me much\\ninformation about the country; deploring the laxity of Meccan morals,\\nand lamenting that in these evil days his countrymen had forfeited\\ntheir name at Cairo and at Constantinople. His curiosity about the\\nEnglish in India was great, and I satisfied it by praising, as a Moslem\\nwould, their politike, their evenhanded justice, and their good star.\\nThen he would inquire into the truth of a fable extensively known on\\nthe shores of the Mediterranean and of the Red Sea. The English, it is\\nsaid, sent a mission to Mohammed, inquiring into his doctrines, and\\nbegging that the heroic Khalid bin Walid[FN#4] might be sent to\\nproselytise them. Unfortunately,\\n</p><p>[p.231] the envoys arrived too late\\xef\\xbf\\xbdthe Prophet\\xef\\xbf\\xbds soul had winged its way\\nto Paradise. An abstract of the Moslem scheme was, however, sent to the\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbdIngreez,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd who declined, as the Founder of the New Faith was no more, to\\nabandon their own religion; but the refusal was accompanied with\\nexpressions of regard. For this reason many Moslems in Barbary and\\nother countries hold the English to be of all \\xef\\xbf\\xbdPeople of the Books\\xef\\xbf\\xbd the\\nbest inclined towards them. As regards the Prophet\\xef\\xbf\\xbds tradition concerning\\nthe fall of his birthplace, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdand the thin-calved from the Habash\\n(Abyssinians) shall destroy the Ka\\xef\\xbf\\xbdabah,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd I was informed that towards the\\nend of time a host will pass from Africa in such multitudes that a\\nstone shall be conveyed from hand to hand between Jeddah and Meccah.\\nThis latter condition might easily be accomplished by sixty thousand\\nmen, the distance being only forty-four miles, but the citizens\\nconsider it to express a countless horde. Some pious Moslems have hoped\\nthat in Abdullah bin Zubayr\\xef\\xbf\\xbds re-erection of the Ka\\xef\\xbf\\xbdabah the prophecy was\\nfulfilled[FN#5]: the popular belief, however, remains that the fatal\\nevent is still in the womb of time. In a previous part of this volume I\\nhave alluded to similar evil presentiments which haunt the mind of\\nAl-Islam; and the Christian, zealous for the propagation of his faith,\\nmay see in them an earnest of its still wider diffusion in future ages.\\n[FN#6]\\n</p><p>Late in the afternoon I used to rise, perform ablution, and repair to\\nthe Harim, or wander about the bazars till sunset. After this it was\\nnecessary to return home and prepare for supper\\xef\\xbf\\xbddinner it would be called\\nin the West.\\n</p><p>[p.232] The meal concluded, I used to sit for a time outside the\\nstreet-door in great dignity, upon a broken-backed black-wood chair,\\ntraditionally said to have been left in the house by one of the princes\\nof Delhi, smoking a Shishah, and drinking sundry cups of strong green\\ntea with a slice of lime, a fair substitute for milk. At this hour the\\nseat was as in a theatre, but the words of the actors were of a nature\\nsomewhat too Fescennine for a respectable public. After nightfall we\\neither returned to the Harim or retired to rest. Our common dormitory\\nwas the flat roof of the house; under each cot stood a water-gugglet;\\nand all slept, as must be done in the torrid lands, on and not in bed.\\n</p><p>I sojourned at Meccah but a short time, and, as usual with travellers,\\ndid not see the best specimens of the population. The citizens appeared\\nto me more civilised and more vicious than those of Al-Madinah. They\\noften leave\\n</p><p>\\xef\\xbf\\xbdHome, where small experience grows,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n</p><p>and\\xef\\xbf\\xbdqui multum peregrinatur, raro sanctificatur\\xef\\xbf\\xbdbecome a worldly-wise,\\nGod-forgetting, and Mammonish sort of folk. Tuf w\\xef\\xbf\\xbd asaa, w\\xef\\xbf\\xbd aamil\\nal-saba\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\xef\\xbf\\xbdCircumambulate and run (i.e. between Safa and Marwah) and commit\\nthe Seven (deadly sins)\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\xef\\xbf\\xbdis a satire popularly levelled against them.\\nHence, too, the proverb Al-haram f\\xef\\xbf\\xbd il Haramayn\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\xef\\xbf\\xbdEvil (dwelleth) in the two\\nHoly Cities\\xef\\xbf\\xbd; and no wonder, since plenary indulgence is so easily\\nsecured.[FN#7] The pilgrim is forbidden, or rather dissuaded, from\\nabiding at Meccah after the rites, and wisely. Great emotions must be\\nfollowed by a re-action. And he who stands struck by the first aspect\\nof Allah\\xef\\xbf\\xbds house, after a few months, the marvel waxing stale, sweeps\\npast with indifference or something worse.\\n</p><p>[p.233] There is, however, little at Meccah to offend the eye. As among\\ncertain nations further West, a layer of ashes overspreads the fire:\\nthe mine is concealed by a green turf fair to look upon. It is only\\nwhen wandering by starlight through the northern outskirts of the town\\nthat citizens may be seen with light complexions and delicate limbs,\\ncoarse turbands, and Egyptian woollen robes, speaking disguise and the\\npurpose of disguise. No one within the memory of man has suffered the\\npenalty of immorality. Spirituous liquors are no longer sold, as in\\nBurckhardt\\xef\\xbf\\xbds day,[FN#8] in shops; and some Arnaut officers assured me\\nthat they found considerable difficulty in smuggling flasks of Araki\\nfrom Jeddah.\\n</p><p>The Meccan is a darker man than the Madinite. The people explain this\\nby the heat of the climate. I rather believe it to be caused by the\\nnumber of female slaves that find their way into the market. Gallas,\\nSawahilis, a few Somalis, and Abyssinians are embarked at Suakin,\\nZayla, Tajurrah, and Berberah, carried in thousands to Jeddah, and the\\nHoly City has the pick of every batch. Thence the stream sets\\nNorthwards, a small current towards Al-Madinah, and the main line to\\nEgypt and Turkey.[FN#9]\\n</p><p>Most Meccans have black concubines, and, as has been said, the\\nappearance of the Sharif is almost that of a negro. I did not see one\\nhandsome man in the Holy City, although some of the women appeared to\\nme beautiful. The male profile is high and bony, the forehead recedes,\\nand the head rises unpleasantly towards the region of firmness. In most\\nfamilies male children, when forty days old, are taken to the Ka\\xef\\xbf\\xbdabah,\\nprayed over, and carried home, where the barber draws with a razor\\nthree parallel gashes\\n</p><p>[p.234] down the fleshy portion of each cheek, from the exterior angles\\nof the eyes almost to the corners of the mouth. These Mashali, as they\\nare called,[FN#10] may be of modern date: the citizens declare that the\\ncustom was unknown to their ancestors. I am tempted to assign to it a\\nhigh antiquity, and cannot but attribute a pagan origin to a custom\\nstill prevailing, despite all the interdictions of the Olema. In point\\nof figure the Meccan is somewhat coarse and lymphatic. The ludicrous\\nleanness of the outward man, as described by Ali Bey, survives only in\\nthe remnants of themselves belonging to a bygone century. The young men\\nare rather stout and athletic, but in middle age\\xef\\xbf\\xbdwhen man \\xef\\xbf\\xbdswills and\\nswells\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\xef\\xbf\\xbdthey are apt to degenerate into corpulence.\\n</p><p>The Meccan is a covetous spendthrift. His wealth, lightly won, is\\nlightly prized. Pay, pension, stipends, presents, and the Ikram, here,\\nas at Al-Madinah, supply the citizen with the means of idleness. With\\nhim everything is on the most expensive scale, his marriage, his\\nreligious ceremonies, and his household expenses. His\\n</p><p>[p.235] house is luxuriously furnished; entertainments are frequent,\\nand the junketings of his women make up a heavy bill at the end of the\\nyear. It is a common practice for the citizen to anticipate the\\npilgrimage season by falling into the hands of the usurer. If he be in\\nluck, he catches and \\xef\\xbf\\xbdskins\\xef\\xbf\\xbd one or more of the richest Hajis. On the other\\nhand, should fortune fail him, he will feel for life the effect of\\ninterest running on at the rate of at least fifty per cent., the simple\\nand the compound forms of which are equally familiar to the wily\\nSarraf.[FN#11]\\n</p><p>The most unpleasant peculiarities of the Meccan[s][FN#12] are their\\npride and coarseness of language. Looking upon themselves as the cream\\nof earth\\xef\\xbf\\xbds sons, they resent with extreme asperity the least slighting\\nword concerning the Holy City and its denizens. They plume themselves\\nupon their holy descent, their exclusion of Infidels,[FN#13] their\\nstrict fastings, their learned men, and their purity of\\nlanguage.[FN#14] In fact, their pride shows itself at every moment;\\n</p><p>[p.236] but it is not the pride which makes a man too proud to do \\xef\\xbf\\xbddirty\\nwork.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd My predecessor did not remark their scurrility: he seems, on the\\ncontrary, rather to commend them for respectability in this point. If\\nhe be correct, the present generation has degenerated. The Meccans\\nappeared to me distinguished, even in this foul-mouthed East, by the\\nsuperior licentiousness of their language. Abuse was bad enough in the\\nstreets, but in the house it became intolerable. The Turkish pilgrims\\nremarked, but they were too proud to notice it. The boy Mohammed and\\none of his tall cousins at last transgressed the limits of my\\nendurance. They had been reviling each other vilely one day at the\\nhouse-door about dawn, when I administered the most open reprimand: \\xef\\xbf\\xbdIn\\nmy country (Afghanistan) we hold this to be the hour of prayer, the\\nseason of good thoughts, when men remember Allah; even the Kafir doth\\nnot begin the day with curses and abuse.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd The people around approved, and\\nthe offenders could not refrain from saying, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdThou hast spoken truth, O\\nEffendi!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd Then the bystanders began, as usual, to \\xef\\xbf\\xbdimprove the occasion.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd \\xef\\xbf\\xbdSee,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\nthey exclaimed, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdthis Sulaymani gentleman, he is not the Son of a Holy\\nCity, and yet he teacheth you\\xef\\xbf\\xbdye, the children of the Prophet!\\xef\\xbf\\xbdrepent and\\nfear Allah!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd They replied, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdVerily we do repent, and Allah is a Pardoner\\nand the Merciful!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\xef\\xbf\\xbdwere silent for an hour, and then abused each other more\\nfoully than before. Yet it is a good point in the Meccan character,\\nthat it is open to reason, it can confess itself\\n</p><p>[p.237] in error, and it displays none of that doggedness of vice which\\ndistinguishes the sinner of a more stolid race. Like the people of\\nSouthern Europe, the Semite is easily managed by a jest: though grave\\nand thoughtful, he is by no means deficient in the sly wit which we\\ncall humour, and the solemn gravity of his words contrasts amusingly\\nwith his ideas. He particularly excels in the Cervantic art, the spirit\\nof which, says Sterne, is to clothe low subjects in sublime language.\\nIn Mohammed\\xef\\xbf\\xbds life we find that he by no means disdained a joke,\\nsometimes a little hasarde, as in the case of the Paradise-coveting old\\nwoman. The redeeming qualities of the Meccan are his courage, his\\nbonhommie, his manly suavity of manners, his fiery sense of honour, his\\nstrong family affections, his near approach to what we call patriotism,\\nand his general knowledge: the reproach of extreme ignorance which\\nBurckhardt directs against the Holy City has long ago sped to the Limbo\\nof things that were. The dark half of the picture is formed by pride,\\nbigotry, irreligion, greed of gain, immorality, and prodigal\\nostentation. Of the pilgrimage ceremonies I cannot speak harshly. It\\nmay be true that \\xef\\xbf\\xbdthe rites of the Ka\\xef\\xbf\\xbdabah, emasculated of every idolatrous\\ntendency, still hang a strange unmeaning shroud around the living\\ntheism of Islam.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd But what nation, either in the West or in the East, has\\nbeen able to cast out from its ceremonies every suspicion of its old\\nidolatry? What are the English mistletoe, the Irish wake, the Pardon of\\nBrittany, the Carnival, and the Worship at Iserna? Better far to\\nconsider the Meccan pilgrimage rites in the light of Evil-worship\\nturned into lessons of Good than to philosophize about their\\nstrangeness, and to blunder in asserting them to be insignificant. Even\\nthe Badawi circumambulating the Ka\\xef\\xbf\\xbdabah fortifies his wild belief by the\\nfond thought that he treads the path of \\xef\\xbf\\xbdAllah\\xef\\xbf\\xbds friend.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n</p><p>At Arafat the good Moslem worships in imitation of\\n</p><p>[p.238] the \\xef\\xbf\\xbdPure of Allah[FN#15]\\xef\\xbf\\xbd; and when hurling stones and curses at\\nthree senseless little buttresses which commemorate the appearance of\\nthe fiend, the materialism of the action gives to its sentiment all the\\nstrength and endurance of reality. The supernatural agencies of\\npilgrimage are carefully and sparingly distributed. The angels who\\nrestore the stones from Muna to Muzdalifah; the heavenly host whose\\npinions cause the Ka\\xef\\xbf\\xbdabah\\xef\\xbf\\xbds veil to rise and to wave, and the mysterious\\ncomplement of the pilgrim\\xef\\xbf\\xbds total at the Arafat sermon, all belong to the\\ncategory of spiritual creatures walking earth unseen,\\xef\\xbf\\xbda poetical tenet,\\nnot condemned by Christianity. The Meccans are, it is true, to be\\nreproached with their open Mammon-worship, at times and at places the\\nmost sacred and venerable; but this has no other effect upon the\\npilgrims than to excite disgust and open reprehension. Here, however,\\nwe see no such silly frauds as heavenly fire drawn from a\\nphosphor-match; nor do two rival churches fight in the flesh with teeth\\nand nails, requiring the contemptuous interference of an infidel power\\nto keep around order. Here we see no fair dames staring with their\\nglasses, braques at the Head of the Church; or supporting exhausted\\nnature with the furtive sandwich; or carrying pampered curs who, too\\noften, will not be silent; or scrambling and squeezing to hear\\ntheatrical music, reckless of the fate of the old lady who\\xef\\xbf\\xbdon such\\noccasions there is always one\\xef\\xbf\\xbdhas been \\xef\\xbf\\xbdthrown down and cruelly trampled\\nupon by the crowd.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd If the Meccan citizens are disposed to scoff at the\\nwild Takruri, they do it not so publicly or shamelessly as the Roman\\njeering with ribald jest at the fanaticism of strangers from the bogs\\nof Ireland. Finally, at Meccah there is nothing theatrical, nothing\\nthat suggests the opera; but all is simple and impressive, filling the\\nmind with\\n</p><p>\\xef\\xbf\\xbdA weight of awe not easy to be borne,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n</p><p>and tending, I believe, after its fashion, to good.\\n</p><p>[p.239] As regards the Meccan and Moslem belief that Abraham and his\\nson built the Ka\\xef\\xbf\\xbdabah, it may be observed the Genesitic account of the\\nGreat Patriarch has suggested to learned men the idea of two Abrahams,\\none the son of Terah, another the son of Azar (fire), a Prometheus who\\nimported civilisation and knowledge into Arabia from Harran, the sacred\\ncentre of Sabaean learning.[FN#16] Moslem historians all agree in\\nrepresenting Abraham as a star-worshipper in youth, and Eusebius calls\\nthe patriarch son of Athar; his father\\xef\\xbf\\xbds name, therefore, is no Arab\\ninvention. Whether Ishmael or his sire ever visited Meccah to build the\\nKa\\xef\\xbf\\xbdabah is, in my humble opinion, an open question. The Jewish Scripture\\ninforms us only that the patriarch dwelt at Beersheba and Gerar, in the\\nsouth-west of Palestine, without any allusion to the annual visit which\\nMoslems declare he paid to their Holy City. At the same time Arab\\ntradition speaks clearly and consistently upon the subject, and\\ngenerally omits those miraculous and superstitious adjuncts which cast\\nshadows of sore doubt upon the philosophic mind.\\n</p><p>The amount of risk which a stranger must encounter at the pilgrimage\\nrites is still considerable. A learned Orientalist and divine intimated\\nhis intention, in a work\\n</p><p>[p.240] published but a few years ago, of visiting Meccah without\\ndisguise. He was assured that the Turkish governor would now offer no\\nobstacle to a European traveller. I would strongly dissuade a friend\\nfrom making the attempt. It is true that the Frank is no longer, as in\\nCaptain Head\\xef\\xbf\\xbds day,[FN#17] insulted when he ventures out of the Meccan\\nGate of Jeddah; and that our Vice-Consuls and travellers are allowed,\\non condition that their glance do not pollute the shrine, to visit Taif\\nand the regions lying Eastward of the Holy City. Neither the Pasha nor\\nthe Sharif would, in these days, dare to enforce, in the case of an\\nEnglishman, the old law, a choice thrice offered between circumcision\\nand death. But the first Badawi who caught sight of the Frank\\xef\\xbf\\xbds hat would\\nnot deem himself a man if he did not drive a bullet through the wearer\\xef\\xbf\\xbds\\nhead. At the pilgrimage season disguise is easy on account of the vast\\nand varied multitudes which visit Meccah exposing the traveller only to\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbdstand the buffet with knaves who smell of sweat.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd But woe to the\\nunfortunate who happens to be recognised in public as an Infidel\\xef\\xbf\\xbdunless\\nat least he could throw himself at once upon the protection of the\\ngovernment.[FN#18] Amidst, however, a crowd of pilgrims, whose\\nfanaticism is worked up to the highest pitch, detection would probably\\nensure his dismissal at once al numero de\\xef\\xbf\\xbd piu. Those who find danger the\\nsalt of pleasure may visit Meccah; but if asked whether the results\\njustify the risk, I should reply in the negative. And the Vice-Consul\\nat Jeddah would only do his duty in peremptorily forbidding European\\ntravellers to attempt Meccah without disguise, until the day comes when\\nsuch steps can be taken in the certainty of not causing a mishap;\\n</p><p>[p.241] an accident would not redound to our reputation, as we could\\nnot in justice revenge it.[FN#19]\\n</p><p>On the 14th Zu\\xef\\xbf\\xbdl Hijjah we started to perform the rite of Umrah, or\\nLittle Pilgrimage. After performing ablution, and resuming the Ihram\\nwith the usual ceremonies, I set out, accompanied by the boy Mohammed\\nand his brother Abdullah. Mounting asses which resembled mules in size\\nand speed,[FN#20] we rode to the Harim, and prayed there. Again\\nremounting, we issued through the Bab al-Safa towards the open country\\nnorth-east of the city. The way was crowded with pilgrims, on foot as\\nwell as mounted, and their loud Labbayk distinguished those engaged in\\nthe Umrah rite from the many whose business was with the camp of the\\nDamascus Caravan. At about half a mile from the city we passed on the\\nleft a huge heap of stones, where my companions stood and cursed. This\\ngrim-looking cairn is popularly believed to note the place of the well\\nwhere Abu Lahab laid an ambuscade for the Prophet. This wicked uncle\\nstationed there a slave, with orders to throw headlong into the pit the\\nfirst person who\\n</p><p>[p.242] approached him, and privily persuaded his nephew to visit the\\nspot at night: after a time, anxiously hoping to hear that the deed had\\nbeen done, Abu Lahab incautiously drew nigh, and was precipitated by\\nhis own bravo into the place of destruction.[FN#21] Hence the\\nwell-known saying in Islam, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdWhoso diggeth a well for his brother shall\\nfall into it himself.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd We added our quota of stones,[FN#22] and\\nproceeding, saw the Jeddah road spanning the plain like a white ribbon.\\nIn front of us the highway was now lined with coffee-tents, before\\nwhich effeminate dancing-boys performed to admiring Syrians; a small\\nwhitewashed \\xef\\xbf\\xbdBungalow,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd the palace of the Emir al-Hajj, lay on the left,\\nand all around it clustered the motley encampment of his pilgrims.\\nAfter cantering about three miles from the city, we reached the\\nAlamayn, or two pillars that limit the Sanctuary; and a little beyond\\nit is the small settlement popularly called Al-Umrah.[FN#23]\\nDismounting here, we\\n</p><p>[p.243] sat down on rugs outside a coffee-tent to enjoy the beauty of\\nthe moonlit night, and an hour of Kayf, in the sweet air of the Desert.\\n</p><p>Presently the coffee-tent keeper, after receiving payment, brought us\\nwater for ablution. This preamble over, we entered the principal\\nchapel; an unpretending building, badly lighted, spread with dirty\\nrugs, full of pilgrims, and offensively close. Here we prayed the Isha,\\nor night devotions, and then a two-bow prayer in honour of the\\nIhram,[FN#24] after which we distributed gratuities to the guardians,\\nand alms to the importunate beggars. And now I perceived the object of\\nAbdullah\\xef\\xbf\\xbds companionship. The melancholy man assured me that he had\\nridden out for love of me, and in order to perform as Wakil\\n(substitute) a vicarious pilgrimage for my parents. Vainly I assured\\nhim that they had been strict in the exercises of their faith. He would\\ntake no denial, and I perceived that love of me meant love of my\\ndollars. With a surly assent, he was at last permitted to act for the\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbdpious pilgrim Yusuf (Joseph) bin Ahmad and Fatimah bint Yunus,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\xef\\xbf\\xbdmy\\nprogenitors. It was impossible to prevent smiling at contrasts, as\\nAbdullah, gravely raising his hands, and directing his face to the\\nKa\\xef\\xbf\\xbdabah, intoned, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdI do vow this Ihram of Umrah in the name of Yusuf Son of\\nAhmad, and Fatimah Daughter of Yunus; then render it attainable unto\\nthem, and accept it of them! Bismillah! Allaho Akbar!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n</p><p>[p.244] Remounting, we galloped towards Meccah, shouting Labbayk, and\\nhalting at every half-mile to smoke and drink coffee. In a short time\\nwe entered the city, and repairing to the Harim by the Safa Gate,\\nperformed the Tawaf, or circumambulation of Umrah. After this dull\\nround and necessary repose we left the temple by the same exit, and\\nmounting once more, turned towards Al-Safa, which stands about a\\nhundred yards South-East of the Mosque, and as little deserves its name\\nof \\xef\\xbf\\xbdMountain\\xef\\xbf\\xbd as do those that undulate the face of modern Rome. The Safa\\nend is closed by a mean-looking building, composed of three round\\narches, with a dwarf flight of stairs leading up to them out of a\\nnarrow road. Without dismounting, we wheeled our donkeys[FN#25] round,\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbdleft shoulders forward,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd no easy task in the crowd, and, vainly striving\\nto sight the Ka\\xef\\xbf\\xbdabah through the Bab al-Safa, performed the Niyat, or vow\\nof the rite Al-Sai, or the running.[FN#26] After Tahlil, Takbir, and\\nTalbiyat, we raised our hands in the supplicatory position, and twice\\nrepeated,[FN#27] \\xef\\xbf\\xbdThere is no god but Allah, Alone, without Partner; His\\nis the Kingdom, unto Him be Praise; He giveth Life and Death, He is\\nalive and perisheth not; in His Hand is Good, and He over all Things is\\nOmnipotent.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd Then, with the donkey-boys leading our animals and a stout\\nfellow preceding us with lantern and a quarter-staff to keep off the\\nrunning Badawin, camel-men, and riders of asses, we descended Safa, and\\nwalked slowly down the street Al-Massa, towards Marwah.[FN#28]\\n</p><p>[p.245] During our descent we recited aloud, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdO Allah, cause me to act\\naccording to the Sunnat of Thy Prophet, and to die in His faith, and\\ndefend me from errors and disobedience by Thy Mercy, O most Merciful of\\nthe Merciful!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd Arrived at what is called the Batn al-Wady (Belly of the\\nVale), a place now denoted by the Milayn al-Akhzarayn (the two green\\npillars[FN#29]), one fixed in the Eastern course of the Harim, the\\nother in a house on the right side,[FN#30] we began the running by\\nurging on our beasts. Here the prayer was, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdO Lord, pardon and pity, and\\npass over what Thou knowest, for Thou art the most dear and the most\\ngenerous! Save us from Hell-fire safely, and cause us safely to enter\\nParadise! O Lord, give us Happiness here and Happiness hereafter, and\\nspare us the Torture of the Flames!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd At the end of this supplication we\\nhad passed the Batn, or lowest ground, whose farthest limits were\\nmarked by two other pillars.[FN#31] Again we began to ascend,\\nrepeating, as we went, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdVerily, Safa and Marwah are two of the Monuments\\nof Allah. Whoso, therefore, pilgrimeth to the Temple of Meccah, or\\nperformeth Umrah, it shall be no Crime in him (to run between them\\nboth). And as for him who voluntarily doeth a good Deed, verily Allah\\nis Grateful and Omniscient[FN#32]!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd At length we reached Marwah, a little\\nrise like Safa in the lower slope of Abu Kubays. The houses cluster in\\namphitheatre shape above it, and from the Masa\\xef\\xbf\\xbda, or street below, a\\nshort flight of steps to a platform, bounded on three sides like a\\ntennis-court, by tall walls without arches. The\\n</p><p>[p.246] street, seen from above, has a bowstring curve: it is between\\neight and nine hundred feet long,[FN#33] with high houses on both\\nsides, and small lanes branching off from it. At the foot of the\\nplatform we brought \\xef\\xbf\\xbdright shoulders forward,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd so as to face the Ka\\xef\\xbf\\xbdabah, and\\nraising hands to ears, thrice exclaimed, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdAllaho Akbar.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd This concluded the\\nfirst course, and, of these, seven compose the ceremony Al-Sai, or the\\nrunning. There was a startling contrast with the origin of this\\nceremony,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n</p><p>\\xef\\xbf\\xbdWhen the poor outcast on the cheerless wild,\\nArabia\\xef\\xbf\\xbds parent, clasped her fainting child,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n</p><p>as the Turkish infantry marched, in European dress, with sloped arms,\\ndown the Masa\\xef\\xbf\\xbda to relieve guard. By the side of the half-naked, running\\nBadawin, they look as if Epochs, disconnected by long centuries, had\\nmet. A laxity, too, there was in the frequent appearance of dogs upon\\nthis holy and most memorial ground, which said little in favour of the\\nreligious strictness of the administration.[FN#34]\\n</p><p>Our Sai ended at Mount Marwah. There we dismounted, and sat outside a\\nbarber\\xef\\xbf\\xbds shop, on the right-hand of the street. He operated upon our\\nheads, causing us to repeat, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdO Allah, this my Forelock is in Thy Hand,\\nthen grant me for every Hair a light on the Resurrection-day, O Most\\nMerciful of the Merciful!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd This, and the paying for it, constituted the\\nfourth portion of the Umrah, or Little Pilgrimage.\\n\\tThrowing the skirts of our garments over our heads, to show\\nthat our \\xef\\xbf\\xbdIhram\\xef\\xbf\\xbd was now exchanged for the normal state, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdIhlal,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd we cantered\\nto the Harim, prayed there a two-bow prayer, and returned home not a\\nlittle fatigued.\\n</p><p>[FN#1] Not more than one-quarter of the pilgrims who appear at Arafat\\ngo on to Al-Madinah: the expense, the hardships, and the dangers of the\\njourney account for the smallness of the number. In theology it is \\xef\\xbf\\xbdJaiz,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\nor admissible, to begin with the Prophet\\xef\\xbf\\xbds place of burial. But those\\nperforming the \\xef\\xbf\\xbdHajjat al-Islam\\xef\\xbf\\xbd are enjoined to commence at Meccah.\\n[FN#2] When respectable married men live together in the same house, a\\nrare occurrence, except on journeys, this most ungallant practice of\\nclearing the way is and must be kept up in the East.\\n[FN#3] I offer no lengthened description of the town of Meccah: Ali Bey\\nand Burckhardt have already said all that requires saying. Although the\\norigin of the Bayt Ullah be lost in the glooms of past time, the city\\nis a comparatively modern place, built about A.D. 450, by Kusay and the\\nKuraysh. It contains about 30,000 to 45,000 inhabitants, with lodging\\nroom for at least treble that number; and the material of the houses is\\nbrick, granite, and sandstone from the neighbouring hills. The site is\\na winding valley, on a small plateau, half-way \\xef\\xbf\\xbdbelow the Ghauts.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd Its\\nutmost length is two miles and a half from the Mab\\xef\\xbf\\xbddah (North) to the\\nSouthern mount Jiyad; and three-quarters of a mile would be the extreme\\nbreadth between Abu Kubays Eastward,\\xef\\xbf\\xbdupon whose Western slope the most\\nsolid mass of the town clusters,\\xef\\xbf\\xbdand Jabal Hindi Westward of the city. In\\nthe centre of this line stands the Ka\\xef\\xbf\\xbdabah. I regret being unable to\\noffer the reader a sketch of Meccah, or of the Great Temple. The\\nstranger who would do this should visit the city out of the pilgrimage\\nseason, and hire a room looking into the quadrangle of the Harim. This\\naddition to our knowledge is the more required, as our popular sketches\\n(generally taken from D\\xef\\xbf\\xbdOhsson) are utterly incorrect. The Ka\\xef\\xbf\\xbdabah is\\nalways a recognisable building; but the \\xef\\xbf\\xbdView of Meccah\\xef\\xbf\\xbd known to Europe is\\nnot more like Meccah than like Cairo or Bombay.\\n[FN#4] It is curious that the Afghans should claim this Kuraysh noble\\nas their compatriot. \\xef\\xbf\\xbdOn one occasion, when Khalid bin Walid was saying\\nsomething in his native tongue (the Pushtu or Afghani), Mohammed\\nremarked that assuredly that language was the peculiar dialect of the\\ndamned. As Khalid appeared to suffer from the observation, and to\\nbetray certain symptoms of insubordination, the Prophet condescended to\\ncomfort him by graciously pronouncing the words \\xef\\xbf\\xbdGhashe linda raora,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd i.e.,\\nbring me my bow and arrows. (Remarks on Dr. Dorn\\xef\\xbf\\xbds Chrestomathy of the\\nPushtu or Afghan Language. Trans. Bombay As. Society, 1848.)\\n[FN#5] See the ninth building of the Ka\\xef\\xbf\\xbdabah, described in chap. iv.\\n[FN#6] It requires not the ken of a prophet to foresee the day when\\npolitical necessity\\xef\\xbf\\xbdsternest of [Greek]!\\xef\\xbf\\xbdwill compel us to occupy in force\\nthe fountain-head of Al-Islam.\\n[FN#7] Good acts done at Meccah are rewarded a hundred-thousand-fold in\\nheaven; yet it is not auspicious to dwell there. Omar informs us that\\nan evil deed receives the punishment of seventy.\\n[FN#8] It must be remembered that my predecessor visited Meccah when\\nthe Egyptian army, commanded by Mohammed Ali, held the town.\\n[FN#9] In another place I have ventured a few observations concerning\\nthe easy suppression of this traffic.\\n[FN#10] The act is called \\xef\\xbf\\xbdTashrit,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd or gashing. The body is also marked,\\nbut with smaller cuts, so that the child is covered with blood. Ali Bey\\nwas told by some Meccans that the face-gashes served for the purpose of\\nphlebotomy, by others that they were signs that the scarred was the\\nservant of Allah\\xef\\xbf\\xbds house. He attributes this male-gashing, like\\nfemale-tat[t]ooing, to coquetry. The citizens told me that the custom\\narose from the necessity of preserving children from the kidnapping\\nPersians, and that it is preserved as a mark of the Holy City. But its\\nwide diffusion denotes an earlier origin. Mohammed expressly forbad his\\nfollowers to mark the skin with scars. These \\xef\\xbf\\xbdbeauty marks\\xef\\xbf\\xbd are common to\\nthe nations in the regions to the West of the Red Sea. The Barabarah of\\nUpper Egypt adorn their faces with scars exactly like the Meccans. The\\nAbyssinians moxa themselves in hetacombs for fashion\\xef\\xbf\\xbds sake. I have seen\\ncheeks gashed, as in the Holy City, among the Gallas. Certain races of\\nthe Sawahil trace around the head a corona of little cuts, like those\\nof a cupping instrument. And, to quote no other instances, some Somalis\\nraise ghastly seams upon their chocolate-coloured skins.\\n[FN#11] Sayrafi, money-changer; Sarraf, banker; the Indian \\xef\\xbf\\xbdShroff,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\nbanker, money-changer, and usurer.\\n[FN#12] When speaking of the Meccans I allude only to the section of\\nsociety which fell under my observation, and that more extensive\\ndivision concerning which I obtained notices that could be depended\\nupon.\\n[FN#13] The editor of Burckhardt\\xef\\xbf\\xbds \\xef\\xbf\\xbdTravels in Arabia\\xef\\xbf\\xbd supposes that his\\nauthor\\xef\\xbf\\xbds \\xef\\xbf\\xbdsect of light extinguishers\\xef\\xbf\\xbd were probably Parsees from Surat or\\nBombay. The mistake is truly ludicrous, for no pious Parsee will\\nextinguish a light. Moreover, infidels are not allowed by law to pass\\nthe frontiers of the Sanctuary. The sect alluded to is an obscure\\nheresy in Central Asia; and concerning it the most improbable scandals\\nhave been propagated by the orthodox.\\n[FN#14] It is strange how travellers and linguists differ upon the\\nsubject of Arabic and its dialects. Niebuhr compares their relation to\\nthat of Proven\\xef\\xbf\\xbdal, Spanish, and Italian, whereas Lane declares the\\ndialects to resemble each other more than those of some different\\ncounties in England. Herbin (Grammar) draws a broad line between\\nancient and modern Arabic; but Hochst (Nachrichten von Marokos und Fez)\\nasserts that the difference is not so great as is imagined. Perhaps the\\nsoundest opinion is that proposed by Clodius, in his \\xef\\xbf\\xbdArabic Grammar\\xef\\xbf\\xbd:\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbddialectus Arabum vulgaris tantum differt ab erudita, quantum Isocrates\\ndictio ab hodierna lingua Gr\\xef\\xbf\\xbdca.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd But it must be remembered that the Arabs\\ndivide their spoken and even written language into two orders, the \\xef\\xbf\\xbdKalam\\nWati,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd or vulgar tongue, sometimes employed in epistolary correspondence,\\nand the \\xef\\xbf\\xbdNahwi,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd or grammatical and classical language. Every man of\\neducation uses the former, and can use the latter. And the Koran is no\\nmore a model of Arabic (as it is often assumed to be) than \\xef\\xbf\\xbdParadise Lost\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\nis of English. Inimitable, no man imitates them.\\n[FN#15] Safi Ullah\\xef\\xbf\\xbdAdam.\\n[FN#16] The legend that Abraham was the \\xef\\xbf\\xbdSon of Fire\\xef\\xbf\\xbd might have arisen\\nfrom his birthplace, Ur of the Chaldees. This Ur (whence the Latin uro)\\nbecomes in Persian Hir; in Arabic Irr or Arr. It explains the origin of\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbdOrotalt\\xef\\xbf\\xbd better than by means of \\xef\\xbf\\xbdAllahu Ta\\xef\\xbf\\xbdala.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd This word, variously spelt\\nOurotalt, Orotalt, and Orotal (the latter would be the masculine form\\nin Arabic), is Urrat-ilat, or the goddess of fire, most probably the\\nSun (Al-Shams) which the Semites make a feminine. Forbiggen translates\\nit Sonnen-gott, an error of gender, as the final consonant proves. The\\nother deity of pagan Arabia, Alilat, is clearly Al-Lat. May not the\\nPhoenicians have supplied the word \\xef\\xbf\\xbdIrr,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd which still survives in Erin and\\nin Ireland? even so they gave to the world the name of Britain,\\nBrettainke, Barrat et Tanuki ([Arabic lettering]), the land of tin. And\\nI should more readily believe that Eeran is the land of fire, than\\naccept its derivation from Eer (vir) a man.\\n[FN#17] Captain C. F. Head, author of \\xef\\xbf\\xbdEastern and Egyptian Scenery,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd was,\\nas late as A.D. 1829, pelted by the Badawin, because he passed the\\nEastern gate of Jeddah in a Frankish dress.\\n[FN#18] The best way would be to rush, if possible, into a house; and\\nthe owner would then, for his own interest, as well as honour, defend a\\nstranger till assistance could be procured.\\n[FN#19] Future pilgrims must also remember that the season is gradually\\nreceding towards the heart of the hot weather. For the next fifteen\\nyears, therefore, an additional risk will attend the traveller.\\n[FN#20] Pliny is certainly right about this useful quadruped and its\\ncongeners, the zebra and the wild ass, in describing it as \\xef\\xbf\\xbdanimal\\nfrigoris maxime impatiens.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd It degenerates in cold regions, unless, as in\\nAfghanistan and Barbary, there be a long, hot, and dry summer. Aden,\\nCutch, and Baghdad have fine breeds, whereas those of India and\\nSouth-Eastern Africa are poor and weak. The best and the highest-priced\\ncome from the Maghrib, and second to them ranks the Egyptian race. At\\nMeccah careful feeding and kind usage transform the dull slave into an\\nactive and symmetrical friend of man: he knows his owner\\xef\\xbf\\xbds kind voice,\\nand if one of the two fast, it is generally the biped. The asses of the\\nHoly City are tall and plump, with sleek coats, generally ash or\\ngrey-coloured, the eyes of deer, heads gracefully carried, an ambling\\ngait, and extremely sure-footed. They are equal to great fatigue, and\\nthe stallions have been known, in their ferocity, to kill the groom.\\nThe price varies from 25 to 150 dollars.\\n[FN#21] Such is the popular version of the tale, which differs in some\\npoints from that recorded in books. Others declare that here, in days\\ngone by, stood the house of another notorious malignant, Abu Jahl.\\nSome, again, suppose that in this place a tyrannical governor of Meccah\\nwas summarily \\xef\\xbf\\xbdlynched\\xef\\xbf\\xbd by the indignant populace. The first two\\ntraditions, however, are the favourites, the vulgar\\xef\\xbf\\xbdcitizens, as well as\\npilgrims\\xef\\xbf\\xbdloving to connect such places with the events of their early\\nsacred history. Even in the twelfth century we read that pilgrims used\\nto cast stones at two cairns, covering the remains of Abu Lahab, and\\nthe beautiful termagant, his wife.\\n[FN#22] Certain credulous authors have contrasted these heaps with the\\nclear ground at Muna, for the purpose of a minor miracle. According to\\nthem this cairn steadily grows, as we may believe it would; and that,\\nwere it not for the guardian angels, the millions of little stones\\nannually thrown at the devils would soon form a mass of equal\\nmagnitude. This custom of lapidation, in token of hate, is an ancient\\npractice, still common in the East. Yet, in some parts of Arabia,\\nstones are thrown at tombs as a compliment to the tenant. And in the\\nSomali country, the places where it is said holy men sat, receive the\\nsame doubtful homage.\\n[FN#23] It is called in books Al-Tanim (bestowing plenty); a word which\\nreaders must not confound with the district of the same name in the\\nprovince Khaulan (made by Niebuhr the \\xef\\xbf\\xbdThumna,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd \\xef\\xbf\\xbdThomna,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd or \\xef\\xbf\\xbdTamna,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd capital of\\nthe Catabanites). Other authors apply Al-Tanim to the spot where Abu\\nLahab is supposed to lie. There are two places called Al-Umrah near\\nMeccah. The Kabir, or greater, is, I am told, in the Wady Fatimah, and\\nthe Prophet ordered Ayishah and her sister to begin the ceremonies at\\nthat place. It is now visited by picnic parties and those who would\\npray at the tomb of Maimunah, one of the Prophet\\xef\\xbf\\xbds wives. Modern pilgrims\\ncommence always, I am told, at the Umrah Saghir (the Lesser), which is\\nabout half-way nearer the city.\\n[FN#24] Some assume the Ihram garb at this place.\\n[FN#25] We had still the pretext of my injured foot. When the Sai rite\\nis performed, as it should be, by a pedestrian, he mounts the steps to\\nabout the height of a man, and then turns towards the temple.\\n[FN#26] I will not trouble the reader with this Niyat, which is the\\nsame as that used in the Tawaf rite.\\n[FN#27] Almost every Mutawwif, it must be remembered, has his own set\\nof prayers.\\n[FN#28] \\xef\\xbf\\xbdSafa\\xef\\xbf\\xbd means a large, hard rock; \\xef\\xbf\\xbdMarwah,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd hard, white flints, full of\\nfire.\\n[FN#29] In former times a devastating torrent used to sweep this place\\nafter rains. The Fiumara bed has now disappeared, and the pillars are\\nused as landmarks. Galland observes that these columns are planted upon\\nthe place which supported Eve\\xef\\xbf\\xbds knees, when, after 300 years\\xef\\xbf\\xbd separation,\\nshe was found by Adam.\\n[FN#30] This house is called in books Rubat al-Abbas.\\n[FN#31] Here once stood \\xef\\xbf\\xbdAs\\xef\\xbf\\xbdaf\\xef\\xbf\\xbd and \\xef\\xbf\\xbdNaylah,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd two idols, some say a man and a\\nwoman metamorphosed for stupration in the Temple.\\n[FN#32] Koran, chap. ii.\\n[FN#33] Ibn Jubayr gives 893 steps: other authorities make the distance\\n780 short cubits, the size of an average man\\xef\\xbf\\xbds forearm.\\n[FN#34] The ceremony of running between Safa and Marwah is supposed to\\nrepresent Hagar seeking water for her son. Usually pilgrims perform\\nthis rite on the morning of visiting the Ka\\xef\\xbf\\xbdaba.\\n</p>\\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Chapter_XXXIII._PLACES_OF_PIOUS_VISITATION_AT_MECCAH.\">Chapter XXXIII.

With exceptions of\\nJabal Nur and Jabal Saur,[FN#1] all the places of pious visitation lie\\ninside or close outside the city. It is well worth the while to ascend\\nAbu Kubays; not so much to inspect the Makan al-Hajar and the Shakk\\nal-Kamar,[FN#2] as to obtain an excellent bird\\xef\\xbf\\xbds-eye view of the Harim\\nand the parts adjacent.[FN#3]\\n</p><p>The boy Mohammed had applied himself sedulously to commerce after his\\nreturn home; and had actually been seen by Shaykh Nur sitting in a shop\\nand selling small curiosities. With my plenary consent I was made\\n[p.248] over to Abdullah, his brother. On the morning of the 15th Zu\\xef\\xbf\\xbdl\\nHijjah (19th Sept.) he hired two asses, and accompanied me as guide to\\nthe holy places.\\n</p><p>Mounting our animals, we followed the road before described to the\\nJannat al-Ma\\xef\\xbf\\xbdala, the sacred cemetery of Meccah. A rough wall, with a\\npoor gateway, encloses a patch of barren and grim-looking ground, at\\nthe foot of the chain which bounds the city\\xef\\xbf\\xbds western suburb, and below\\nAl-Akabah, the gap through which Khalid bin Walid entered Meccah with\\nthe triumphant Prophet.[FN#4] Inside are a few ignoble, whitewashed\\ndomes: all are of modern construction, for here, as at Al-Bakia,\\nfurther north, the Wahhabis indulged their levelling\\npropensities.[FN#5] The rest of the ground shows some small enclosures\\nbelonging to particular houses,\\xef\\xbf\\xbdequivalent to our family vaults,\\xef\\xbf\\xbdand the\\nruins of humble tombs, lying in confusion, whilst a few parched aloes\\nspring from between the bricks and stones.[FN#6]\\n</p><p>[p.249] The cemetery is celebrated in local history: here the body of\\nAbdullah bin Zubayr was exposed by order of Hajjaj bin Yusuf; and the\\nnumber of saints buried in it has been so numerous, that even in the\\ntwelfth century many had fallen into oblivion. It is visited by the\\ncitizens on Fridays, and by women on Thursdays, to prevent that meeting\\nof sexes which in the East is so detrimental to public decorum. I shall\\nbe sparing in my description of the Ma\\xef\\xbf\\xbdala ceremonies, as the prayers,\\nprostrations, and supplications are almost identical with those\\nperformed at Al-Bakia.\\n</p><p>After a long supplication, pronounced standing at the doorway, we\\nentered, and sauntered about the burial-ground. On the left of the road\\nstood an enclosure, which, according to Abdullah, belonged to his\\nfamily. The door and stone slabs, being valuable to the poor, had been\\nremoved, and the graves of his forefathers appeared to have been\\ninvaded by the jackal. He sighed, recited a Fatihah with tears in his\\neyes, and hurried me away from the spot.\\n</p><p>The first dome which we visited covered the remains of Abd al-Rahman,\\nthe son of Abu Bakr, one of the Worthies of Al-Islam, equally respected\\nby Sunni and by Shi\\xef\\xbf\\xbdah. The tomb was a simple catafalque, spread with the\\nusual cloth. After performing our devotions at this grave, and\\ndistributing a few piastres to guardians and beggars, we crossed the\\nmain path, and found ourselves at the door of the cupola, beneath which\\nsleeps the venerable Khadijah, Mohammed\\xef\\xbf\\xbds first wife. The tomb was\\ncovered with a green cloth, and the walls of the little building were\\ndecorated with written specimens of religious poetry. A little beyond\\nit, we were shown into another dome, the resting-place of Sitt Aminah,\\nthe Prophet\\xef\\xbf\\xbds mother.[FN#7] Burckhardt chronicles its ill-usage by\\n[p.250] the fanatic Wahhabis: it has now been rebuilt in that frugal\\nstyle that characterizes the architecture of Al-Hijaz. An exceedingly\\ngarrulous old woman came to the door, invited us in, and superintended\\nour devotions; at the end of which she sprinkled rosewater upon my\\nface. When asked for a cool draught, she handed me a metal saucer,\\nwhose contents smelt strongly of mastic, earnestly directing me to\\ndrink it in a sitting posture. This tomb she informed us is the\\nproperty of a single woman, who visits it every evening, receives the\\ncontributions of the Faithful, prays, sweeps the pavement, and dusts\\nthe furniture. We left five piastres for this respectable maiden, and\\ngratified the officious crone with another shilling. She repaid us by\\nsignalling to some score of beggars that a rich pilgrim had entered the\\nMa\\xef\\xbf\\xbdala, and their importunities fairly drove me out of the hallowed walls.\\n</p><p>Leaving the Jannat al-Ma\\xef\\xbf\\xbdala, we returned towards the town, and halted on\\nthe left side of the road, at a mean building called the Masjid al-Jinn\\n(of the Genii). Here was revealed the seventy-second chapter of the\\nKoran, called after the name of the mysterious fire-drakes who paid\\nfealty to the Prophet. Descending a flight of steps,\\xef\\xbf\\xbdfor this Mosque,\\nlike all ancient localities at Meccah, is as much below as above\\nground,\\xef\\xbf\\xbdwe entered a small apartment containing water-pots for drinking\\nand all the appurtenances of ablution. In it is shown the Mauza\\nal-Khatt (place of the writing), where Mohammed wrote a letter to Abu\\nMas\\xef\\xbf\\xbdud after the homage of the Jinnis. A second and interior flight of\\nstone steps led to another diminutive oratory, where the Prophet used\\nto pray and receive the archangel Gabriel. Having performed a pair of\\nbows, which caused the perspiration\\n</p><p>[p.251 to burst forth as if in a Russian bath, I paid a few piastres,\\nand issued from the building with much satisfaction.\\n</p><p>We had some difficulty in urging our donkeys through the crowded\\nstreet, called the Zukak al-Hajar. Presently we arrived at the Bayt\\nal-Nabi, the Prophet\\xef\\xbf\\xbds old house, in which he lived with the Sitt\\nKhadijah. Here, says Burckhardt, the Lady Fatimah first saw the\\nlight[FN#8]; and here, according to Ibn Jubayr, Hasan and Hosayn were\\nborn. Dismounting at the entrance, we descended a deep flight of steps,\\nand found ourselves in a spacious hall, vaulted, and of better\\nappearance than most of the sacred edifices at Meccah. In the centre,\\nand well railed round, stood a closet of rich green and gold stuffs, in\\nshape not unlike an umbrella-tent. A surly porter guarded the closed\\ndoor, which some respectable people vainly attempted to open by honeyed\\nwords: a whisper from Abdullah solved the difficulty. I was directed to\\nlie at full length upon my stomach, and to kiss a black-looking\\nstone\\xef\\xbf\\xbdsaid to be the lower half of the Lady Fatimah\\xef\\xbf\\xbds quern[FN#9]\\xef\\xbf\\xbdfixed at\\nthe bottom of a basin of the same material. Thence we repaired to a\\ncorner, and recited a two-bow at the place where the Prophet used to\\npray the Sunnat and the Nafilah, or supererogatory devotions.[FN#10]\\n</p><p>Again remounting, we proceeded at a leisurely pace homewards, and on\\nthe way passed through the principal\\n</p><p>[p.252] slave-market. It is a large street roofed with matting, and\\nfull of coffee-houses. The merchandise sat in rows, parallel with the\\nwalls. The prettiest girls occupied the highest benches, below were the\\nplainer sort, and lowest of all the boys. They were all gaily dressed\\nin pink and other light-coloured muslins, with transparent veils over\\ntheir heads; and, whether from the effect of such unusual splendour, or\\nfrom the re-action succeeding to their terrible land-journey and\\nsea-voyage, they appeared perfectly happy, laughing loudly, talking\\nunknown tongues, and quizzing purchasers, even during the delicate\\noperation of purchasing. There were some pretty Gallas, douce-looking\\nAbyssinians, and Africans of various degrees of hideousness, from the\\nhalf-Arab Somal to the baboon-like Sawahili. The highest price of which\\nI could hear was \\xef\\xbf\\xbd60. And here I matured a resolve to strike, if favoured\\nby fortune, a death-blow at a trade which is eating into the vitals of\\nindustry in Eastern Africa. The reflection was pleasant,\\xef\\xbf\\xbdthe idea that\\nthe humble Haji, contemplating the scene from his donkey, might become\\nthe instrument of the total abolition of this pernicious\\ntraffic.[FN#11] What would have become of that pilgrim had the crowd in\\nthe slave-market guessed his intentions?\\n</p><p>Passing through the large bazar, called the Suk al-Layl, I saw the\\npalace of Mohammed bin Aun, quondam Prince of Meccah. It has a certain\\nlook of rude magnificence,\\n</p><p>[p.253] the effect of huge hanging balconies scattered in profusion\\nover lofty walls, claire-voies of brickwork, and courses of\\nvarious-coloured stone. The owner is highly popular among the Badawin,\\nand feared by the citizens on account of his fierce looks, courage, and\\ntreachery. They described him to me as vir bonus, bene strangulando\\nperitus; but Mr. Cole, who knew him personally, gave him a high\\ncharacter for generosity and freedom from fanaticism. He seems to have\\nsome idea of the state which should \\xef\\xbf\\xbdhedge in\\xef\\xbf\\xbd a ruler. His palaces at\\nMeccah, and that now turned into a Wakalah at Jeddah, are the only\\nplaces in the country that can be called princely. He is now a state\\nprisoner at Constantinople, and the Badawin pray in vain for his\\nreturn.[FN#12]\\n</p><p>The other places of pious visitation at Meccah are briefly these:\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n</p><p>1. Natak al-Nabi, a small oratory in the Zukak al-Hajar. It derives its\\nname from the following circumstance.\\n</p><p>[p.254] As the Prophet was knocking at the door of Abu Bakr\\xef\\xbf\\xbds shop, a\\nstone gave him God-speed, and told him that the master was not at home.\\nThe wonderful mineral is of a reddish-black colour, about a foot in\\ndimension, and fixed in the wall somewhat higher than a man\\xef\\xbf\\xbds head. There\\nare servants attached to it, and the street sides are spread, as usual,\\nwith the napkins of importunate beggars.\\n</p><p>2. Maulid al-Nabi, or the Prophet\\xef\\xbf\\xbds birthplace.[FN#13] It is a little\\nchapel in the Suk al-Layl, not far from Mohammed bin Aun\\xef\\xbf\\xbds palace. It is\\nbelow the present level of the ground, and in the centre is a kind of\\ntent, concealing, it is said, a hole in the floor upon which Aminah sat\\nto be delivered.\\n</p><p>3. In the quarter \\xef\\xbf\\xbdSha\\xef\\xbf\\xbdab Ali,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd near the Maulid al-Nabi, is the birthplace of\\nAli, another oratory below the ground. Here, as in the former place, a\\nMaulid and a Ziyarah are held on the anniversary of the Lion\\xef\\xbf\\xbds birth.\\n</p><p>4. Near Khadijah\\xef\\xbf\\xbds house and the Natak al-Nabi is a place called\\nAl-Muttaka, from a stone against which the Prophet leaned when worn out\\nwith fatigue. It is much visited by devotees; and some declare that on\\none occasion, when the Father of Lies appeared to the Prophet in the\\nform of an elderly man, and tempted him to sin by asserting that the\\nMosque-prayers were over, this stone, disclosing the fraud, caused the\\nFiend to flee.\\n</p><p>5. Maulid Hamzah, a little building at the old Bab Umrah, near the\\nShabayki cemetery. Here was the Bazan, or channel down which the Ayn\\nHunayn ran into the Birkat Majid. Many authorities doubt that Hamzah\\nwas born at this place.[FN#14]\\n</p><p>[p.255] The reader must now be as tired of \\xef\\xbf\\xbdPious Visitations\\xef\\xbf\\xbd as I was.\\n</p><p>Before leaving Meccah I was urgently invited to dine by old Ali bin Ya\\nSin, the Zemzemi; a proof that he entertained inordinate expectations,\\nexcited, it appeared, by the boy Mohammed, for the simple purpose of\\nexalting his own dignity. One day we were hurriedly summoned about\\nthree P.M. to the senior\\xef\\xbf\\xbds house, a large building in the Zukak al-Hajar.\\nWe found it full of pilgrims, amongst whom we had no trouble to\\nrecognise our fellow-travellers, the quarrelsome old Arnaut and his\\nimpudent slave-boy. Ali met us upon the staircase, and conducted us\\ninto an upper room, where we sat upon diwans, and with pipes and coffee\\nprepared for dinner. Presently the semicircle arose to receive a\\neunuch, who lodged somewhere in the house. He was a person of\\nimportance, being the guardian of some dames of high degree at Cairo\\nand Constantinople: the highest place and\\n</p><p>[p.256] the best pipe were unhesitatingly offered to and accepted by\\nhim. He sat down with dignity, answered diplomatically certain\\nmysterious questions about the dames, and applied his blubber lips to a\\nhandsome mouthpiece of lemon-coloured amber. It was a fair lesson of\\nhumility for a man to find himself ranked beneath this high-shouldered,\\nspindle-shanked, beardless bit of neutrality; and as such I took it\\nduly to heart.\\n</p><p>The dinner was served up in a Sini, a plated copper tray about six feet\\nin circumference, and handsomely ornamented with arabesques and\\ninscriptions. Under this was the usual Kursi, or stool, composed of\\nmother-o\\xef\\xbf\\xbd-pearl facets set in sandal-wood; and upon it a well-tinned and\\nclean-looking service of the same material as the Sini. We began with a\\nvariety of stews\\xef\\xbf\\xbdstews with spinach, stews with Bamiyah (hibiscus), and\\nrich vegetable stews. These being removed, we dipped hands in Biryani,\\na meat pillaw, abounding in clarified butter; Kimah, finely chopped\\nmeat; Warak Mahshi, vine leaves filled with chopped and spiced mutton,\\nand folded into small triangles; Kabab, or bits of roti spitted in\\nmouthfuls upon a splinter of wood; together with a Salatah of the\\ncrispest cucumber, and various dishes of water-melon cut up into\\nsquares.\\n</p><p>Bread was represented by the Eastern scone, but it was of superior\\nflavour, and far better than the ill-famed Chapati of India. Our drink\\nwas water perfumed with mastic. After the meat came a Kunafah, fine\\nvermicelli sweetened with honey, and sprinkled with powdered white\\nsugar; several stews of apples and quinces; Muhallibah, a thin jelly\\nmade of rice, flour, milk, starch, and a little perfume; together with\\nsquares of Rahah,[FN#15] a confiture\\n</p><p>[p.257] highly prized in these regions, because it comes from\\nConstantinople. Fruits were then placed upon the table; plates full of\\npomegranate grains and dates of the finest flavour.[FN#16] The dinner\\nconcluded with a pillaw of rice and butter, for the easier discussion\\nof which we were provided with carved wooden spoons.\\n</p><p>Arabs ignore the delightful French art of prolonging a dinner. After\\nwashing your hands, you sit down, throw an embroidered napkin over your\\nknees, and with a \\xef\\xbf\\xbdBismillah,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd by way of grace, plunge your hand into the\\nattractive dish, changing ad libitum, occasionally sucking your\\nfinger-tips as boys do lollipops, and varying that diversion by\\ncramming a chosen morsel into a friend\\xef\\xbf\\xbds mouth. When your hunger is\\nsatisfied, you do not sit for your companions; you exclaim \\xef\\xbf\\xbdAl Hamd!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd edge\\naway from the tray, wash your hands and mouth with soap, display signs\\nof repletion, otherwise you will be pressed to eat more, seize your\\npipe, sip your coffee, and take your \\xef\\xbf\\xbdKayf.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd Nor is it customary, in these\\nlands, to sit together after dinner\\xef\\xbf\\xbdthe evening prayer cuts short the\\nseance. Before we rose to take leave of Ali bin Ya Sin, a boy ran into\\nthe room, and displayed those infantine civilities which in the East\\nare equivalent to begging a present. I slipped a dollar into his hand;\\nat the sight of which he, veritable little Meccan, could not contain\\nhis joy. \\xef\\xbf\\xbdThe Riyal!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd he exclaimed; \\xef\\xbf\\xbdthe Riyal! look, grandpa\\xef\\xbf\\xbd, the good\\nEffendi has given me a Riyal!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd The old gentleman\\xef\\xbf\\xbds eyes twinkled with\\nemotion: he saw how easily the coin had slipped from my fingers, and he\\nfondly hoped that he had not seen the last piece. \\xef\\xbf\\xbdVerily thou art a good\\n</p><p>[p.258] young man!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd he ejaculated, adding fervently, as prayers cost\\nnothing, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdMay Allah further all thy desires.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd A gentle patting of the back\\nevidenced his high approval.\\n</p><p>I never saw old Ali after that evening, but entrusted to the boy\\nMohammed what was considered a just equivalent for his services.\\n</p><p>[FN#1] Jabal Nur, or Hira, has been mentioned before. Jabal Saur rises\\nat some distance to the South of Meccah, and contains the celebrated\\ncave in which Mohammed and Abu Bakr took refuge during the flight.\\n[FN#2] The tradition of these places is related by every historian. The\\nformer is the repository of the Black Stone during the Deluge. The\\nlatter, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdsplitting of the moon,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd is the spot where the Prophet stood when,\\nto convert the idolatrous Kuraysh, he caused half the orb of night to\\nrise from behind Abu Kubays, and the other from Jabal Kayka\\xef\\xbf\\xbdan, on the\\nWestern horizon. This silly legend appears unknown to Mohammed\\xef\\xbf\\xbds day.\\n[FN#3] The pilgrimage season, strictly speaking, concluded this year on\\nthe 17th September (13th Zu\\xef\\xbf\\xbdl Hijjah); at which time travellers began to\\nmove towards Jeddah. Those who purposed visiting Al-Madinah would start\\nabout three weeks afterwards, and many who had leisure intended\\nwitnessing the Muharram ceremonies at Meccah.\\n[FN#4] This is the local tradition; it does not agree with authentic\\nhistory. Muir (Life of Mahomet, vol. iv. p. 126) reminds me that Khalid\\nand his Badawin attacked the citizens of Meccah without the Prophet\\xef\\xbf\\xbds\\nleave. But after the attack he may have followed in his leader\\xef\\xbf\\xbds train.\\n[FN#5] The reason of their Vandalism has been noticed in a previous\\nvolume.\\n[FN#6] The Aloe here, as in Egypt, is hung, like the dried crocodile,\\nover houses as a talisman against evil spirits. Burckhardt assigns, as\\na motive for it being planted in graveyards, that its name Saber\\ndenotes the patience with which the believer awaits the Last Day. And\\nLane remarks, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdThe Aloe thus hung (over the door), without earth and\\nwater, will live for several years, and even blossom: hence it is\\ncalled Saber, which signifies patience.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd In India it is hung up to\\nprevent Mosquitoes entering a room. I believe the superstition to be a\\nfragment of African fetichism. The Gallas, to the present day, plant\\nAloes on graves, and suppose that when the plant sprouts the deceased\\nhas been admitted into the gardens of \\xef\\xbf\\xbdWak\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\xef\\xbf\\xbdthe Creator. Ideas breed\\nvocables; but seldom, except among rhymesters, does a vocable give\\nbirth to a popular idea: and in Arabic \\xef\\xbf\\xbdSibr,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd as well as \\xef\\xbf\\xbdSabr,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd is the name\\nof the Aloe.\\n[FN#7] Burckhardt mentions the \\xef\\xbf\\xbdTomb of Umna, the mother of Mohammed,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd in\\nthe Ma\\xef\\xbf\\xbdala at Meccah; and all the ciceroni agree about the locality. Yet\\nhistorians place it at Abwa, where she gave up the ghost, after\\nvisiting Al-Madinah to introduce her son to his relations. And the\\nlearned believe that the Prophet refused to pray over or to intercede\\nfor his mother, she having died before Al-Islam was revealed.\\n[FN#8] Burckhardt calls it \\xef\\xbf\\xbdMaulid Sittna Fatimah\\xef\\xbf\\xbd: but the name \\xef\\xbf\\xbdKubbat el\\nWahy,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd applied by my predecessor to this locality, is generally made\\nsynonymous with Al-Mukhtaba, the \\xef\\xbf\\xbdhiding-place\\xef\\xbf\\xbd where the Prophet and his\\nfollowers used in dangerous times to meet for prayer.\\n[FN#9] So loose is local tradition, that some have confounded this\\nquern with the Natak al-Nabi, the stone which gave God-speed to the\\nProphet.\\n[FN#10] He would of course pray the Farz, or obligatory devotions, at\\nthe shrine.\\n[FN#11] About a year since writing the above a firman was issued by the\\nPorte suppressing the traffic from Central Africa. Hitherto we have\\nrespected slavery in the Red Sea, because the Turk thence drew his\\nsupplies; we are now destitute of an excuse. A single steamer would\\ndestroy the trade, and if we delay to take active measures, the people\\nof England, who have spent millions in keeping up a West African\\nsquadron, will not hold us guiltless of negligence.\\nNOTE TO SECOND EDITION.\\xef\\xbf\\xbdThe slave trade has, since these remarks were\\npenned, been suppressed with a high hand; the Arabs of Al-Hijaz\\nresented the measure by disowning the supremacy of the Porte, but they\\nwere soon reduced to submission.\\n[FN#12] The Prince was first invested with the Sharifat by Mohammed Ali\\nof Egypt in A.D. 1827, when Yahya fled, after stabbing his nephew in\\nthe Ka\\xef\\xbf\\xbdabah, to the Benu Harb Badawin. He was supported by Ahmad Pasha of\\nMeccah, with a large army; but after the battle of Tarabah, in which\\nIbrahim Pasha was worsted by the Badawin, Mohammed Bin Aun, accused of\\nacting as Sylla, was sent in honourable bondage to Cairo. He again\\nreturned to Meccah, where the rapacity of his eldest son, Abdullah, who\\nwould rob pilgrims, caused fresh misfortunes. In A.D. 1851, when Abd\\nal-Muttalib was appointed Sharif, the Pasha was ordered to send Bin Aun\\nto Stambul\\xef\\xbf\\xbdno easy task. The Turk succeeded by a man\\xef\\xbf\\xbduvre. Mohammed\\xef\\xbf\\xbds two\\nsons, happening to be at Jeddah, were invited to inspect a man-of-war,\\nand were there made prisoners. Upon this the father yielded himself up;\\nalthough, it is said, the flashing of the Badawi\\xef\\xbf\\xbds sabre during his\\nembarkation made the Turks rejoice that they had won the day by\\nstate-craft. The wild men of Al-Hijaz still sing songs in honour of\\nthis Sharif.\\nNOTE TO SECOND EDITION.\\xef\\xbf\\xbdEarly in 1856, when the Sharif Abd al-Muttalib\\nwas deposed, Mohammed bin Aun was sent from Constantinople to quiet the\\ninsurrection caused by the new slave laws in Al-Hijaz. In a short space\\nof time he completely succeeded.\\n[FN#13] The 12th of Rabia al-Awwal, Mohammed\\xef\\xbf\\xbds birthday, is here\\ncelebrated with great festivities, feasts, prayers, and perusals of the\\nKoran. These \\xef\\xbf\\xbdMaulid\\xef\\xbf\\xbd (ceremonies of nativity) are by no means limited to a\\nsingle day in the year.\\n[FN#14] The reader is warned that I did not see the five places above\\nenumerated. The ciceroni and books mention twelve other visitations,\\nseveral of which are known only by name.\\n1. Al-Mukhtaba, the \\xef\\xbf\\xbdhiding-place\\xef\\xbf\\xbd alluded to in the preceding pages. Its\\nlocality is the subject of debate.\\n2. Dar al-Khayzaran, where the Prophet prayed secretly till the\\nconversion of Omar enabled him to dispense with concealment.\\n3. Maulid Omar, or Omar\\xef\\xbf\\xbds birthplace, mentioned in books as being visited\\nby devotees in the 14th Rabia al-Awwal of every year.\\n4. Abu Bakr\\xef\\xbf\\xbds house near the Natak al-Nabi. It is supposed to have been\\ndestroyed in the twelfth century.\\n5. Maulid Ja\\xef\\xbf\\xbdafar al-Tayyar, near the Shabayki cemetery.\\n6. Al-Mada\\xef\\xbf\\xbda, an oratory, also called Naf al-Arz, because creation here\\nbegan.\\n7. Dar al-Hijrah, where Mohammed and Abu Bakr mounted for the flight.\\n8. Masjid al-Rayah, where the Prophet planted his flag when Meccah\\nsurrendered.\\n9. Masjid al-Shajarah, a spot at which Mohammed caused a tree to\\nadvance and to retire.\\n10. Masjid al-Ja\\xef\\xbf\\xbdaranah, where Mohammed clad himself in the pilgrim garb.\\nIt is still visited by some Persians.\\n11. Mas[]jid Ibrahim, or Abu Kubays.\\n12.

However, if a guest is to be honoured,\\nrosewater must often take the place of the pure element, even in tea.\\n[FN#16] Meccah is amply supplied with water-melons, dates, limes,\\ngrapes, cucumbers, and other vegetables from Taif and Wady Fatimah.\\nDuring the pilgrimage season the former place sends at least 100 camels\\nevery day to the capital.\\n</p>\\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Chapter_XXXIV._TO_JEDDAH.\">Chapter XXXIV.

All the devotees were now \\xef\\xbf\\xbdwhitewashed\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\xef\\xbf\\xbdthe\\nbook of their sins was a tabula rasa: too many of them lost no time in\\nmaking a new departure \\xef\\xbf\\xbddown south,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd and in opening a fresh account. The\\nfaith must not bear the blame of the irregularities. They may be\\nequally observed in the Calvinist, after a Sunday of prayer, sinning\\nthrough Monday with a zest, and the Romanist falling back with new\\nfervour upon the causes of his confession and penance, as in the Moslem\\nwho washes his soul clean by running and circumambulation; and, in\\nfairness, it must be observed that, as amongst Christians, so in the\\nMoslem persuasion, there are many notable exceptions to this rule of\\nextremes. Several of my friends and acquaintances date their\\nreformation from their first sight of the Ka\\xef\\xbf\\xbdabah.\\n</p><p>The Moslem\\xef\\xbf\\xbds \\xef\\xbf\\xbdHoly Week\\xef\\xbf\\xbd over, nothing detained me at Meccah. For reasons\\nbefore stated, I resolved upon returning to Cairo, resting there for\\nawhile, and starting a second time for the interior, via Muwaylah.[FN#1]\\n</p><p>The Meccans are as fond of little presents as are nuns: the Kabirah\\ntook an affectionate leave of me, begged me to be careful of her boy,\\nwho was to accompany\\n</p><p>[p.260] me to Jeddah, and laid friendly but firm hands upon a brass\\npestle and mortar, upon which she had long cast the eye of\\nconcupiscence.\\n</p><p>Having hired two camels for thirty-five piastres, and paid half the sum\\nin advance, I sent on my heavy boxes with Shaykh, now Haji Nur, to\\nJeddah.[FN#2] Omar Effendi was to wait at Meccah till his father had\\nstarted, in command of the Dromedary Caravan, when he would privily\\ntake ass, join me at the port, and return to his beloved Cairo. I bade\\na long farewell to all my friends, embraced the Turkish pilgrims, and\\nmounting our donkeys, the boy Mohammed and I left the house. Abdullah\\nthe Melancholy followed us on foot through the city, and took leave of\\nme, though without embracing, at the Shabayki quarter.\\n</p><p>Issuing into the open plain, I felt a thrill of pleasure\\xef\\xbf\\xbdsuch joy as only\\nthe captive delivered from his dungeon can experience. The sunbeams\\nwarmed me into renewed life and vigour, the air of the Desert was a\\nperfume, and the homely face of Nature was as the smile of a dear old\\nfriend. I contemplated the Syrian Caravan, lying on the right of our\\nroad, without any of the sadness usually suggested by a parting look.\\n</p><p>It is not my intention minutely to describe the line down which we\\ntravelled that night: the pages of Burckhardt give full information\\nabout the country. Leaving Meccah, we fell into the direct road running\\nsouth of Wady Fatimah, and traversed for about an hour a flat\\nsurrounded by hills. Then we entered a valley by a flight of rough\\nstone steps, dangerously slippery and zigzag, intended to facilitate\\nthe descent for camels and for laden beasts. About midnight we passed\\ninto a hill-girt Wady, here covered with deep sands, there hard with\\n[p.261] gravelly clay: and, finally, about dawn, we sighted the\\nmaritime plain of Jeddah.\\n</p><p>Shortly after leaving the city, our party was joined by other\\ntravellers, and towards evening we found ourselves in force, the effect\\nof an order that pilgrims must not proceed singly upon this road.\\nCoffee-houses and places of refreshment abounding, we halted every five\\nmiles to refresh ourselves and the donkeys.[FN#3] At sunset we prayed\\nnear a Turkish guard-house, where one of the soldiers kindly supplied\\nme with water for ablution.\\n</p><p>Before nightfall I was accosted, in Turkish, by a one-eyed old fellow,\\nwho,\\n</p><p>\\xef\\xbf\\xbdwith faded brow,\\nEntrenched with many a frown, and conic beard,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n</p><p>and habited in unclean garments, was bestriding a donkey as faded as\\nhimself. When I shook my head, he addressed me in Persian. The same\\nman\\xef\\xbf\\xbduvre made him try Arabic; still he obtained no answer. Then he\\ngrumbled out good Hindustani. That also failing, he tried successively\\nPushtu, Armenian, English, French, and Italian. At last I could \\xef\\xbf\\xbdkeep a\\nstiff lip\\xef\\xbf\\xbd no longer; at every change of dialect his emphasis beginning\\nwith \\xef\\xbf\\xbdThen who the d\\xef\\xbf\\xbd are you?\\xef\\xbf\\xbd became more emphatic. I turned upon him in\\nPersian, and found that he had been a pilot, a courier, and a servant\\nto Eastern tourists, and that he had visited England, France, and\\nItaly, the Cape, India, Central Asia, and China. We then chatted in\\nEnglish, which Haji Akif spoke well, but with all manner of courier\\xef\\xbf\\xbds\\nphrases; Haji Abdullah so badly, that he was counselled a course of\\nstudy. It was not a little strange to hear such phrases as \\xef\\xbf\\xbdCome \\xef\\xbf\\xbdp, Neddy,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\nand \\xef\\xbf\\xbdCre nom d\\xef\\xbf\\xbdun baudet,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd almost within earshot of the tomb of Ishmael, the\\nbirthplace of Mohammed, and the Sanctuary of Al-Islam.\\n</p><p>[p.262] About eight P.M. we passed the Alamayn, which define the\\nSanctuary in this direction. They stand about nine miles from Meccah,\\nand near them are a coffee-house and a little oratory, popularly known\\nas the Sabil Agha Almas. On the road, as night advanced, we met long\\nstrings of camels, some carrying litters, others huge beams, and others\\nbales of coffee, grain, and merchandise. Sleep began to weigh heavily\\nupon my companions\\xef\\xbf\\xbd eye-lids, and the boy Mohammed hung over the flank of\\nhis donkey in a most ludicrous position.\\n</p><p>About midnight we reached a mass of huts, called Al-Haddah. Ali Bey\\nplaces it eight leagues from Jeddah. At \\xef\\xbf\\xbdthe Boundary\\xef\\xbf\\xbd which is considered\\nto be the half-way halting-place, Pilgrims must assume the religious\\ngarb,[FN#4] and Infidels travelling to Taif are taken off the Meccan\\nroad into one leading Northward to Arafat. The settlement is a\\ncollection of huts and hovels, built with sticks and reeds, supporting\\nbrushwood and burned and blackened palm leaves. It is maintained for\\nsupplying pilgrims with coffee and water. Travellers speak with horror\\nof its heat during the day; Ali Bey, who visited it twice, compares it\\nto a furnace. Here the country slopes gradually towards the sea, the\\nhills draw off, and every object denotes departure from the Meccan\\nplateau. At Al-Haddah we dismounted for an hour\\xef\\xbf\\xbds halt. A coffee-house\\nsupplied us with mats, water-pipes, and other necessaries; we then\\nproduced a basket of provisions, the parting gift of the kind Kabirah,\\nand, this late supper concluded, we lay down to doze.\\n</p><p>After half an hour\\xef\\xbf\\xbds halt had expired, and the donkeys were saddled, I\\nshook up with difficulty the boy Mohammed, and induced him to mount. He\\nwas, to use his own expression, \\xef\\xbf\\xbddead from sleep\\xef\\xbf\\xbd; and we had\\n</p><p>[p.263] scarcely advanced an hour, when, arriving at another little\\ncoffee-house, he threw himself upon the ground, and declared it\\nimpossible to proceed. This act caused some confusion. The donkey-boy\\nwas a pert little Badawi, offensively republican in manner. He had\\nseveral times addressed me impudently, ordering me not to flog his\\nanimal, or to hammer its sides with my heels. On these occasions he\\nreceived a contemptuous snub, which had the effect of silencing him.\\nBut now, thinking we were in his power, he swore that he would lead\\naway the beasts, and leave us behind to be robbed and murdered. A pinch\\nof the windpipe, and a spin over the ground, altered his plans at the\\noutset of execution. He gnawed his hand with impotent rage, and went\\naway, threatening us with the Governor of Jeddah next morning. Then an\\nEgyptian of the party took up the thread of remonstrance; and, aided by\\nthe old linguist, who said, in English \\xef\\xbf\\xbdby G\\xef\\xbf\\xbd! you must budge, you\\xef\\xbf\\xbdll catch\\nit here!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd he assumed a brisk and energetic style, exclaiming, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdYallah! rise\\nand mount; thou art only losing our time; thou dost not intend to sleep\\nin the Desert!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd I replied, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdO my Uncle, do not exceed in talk!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\xef\\xbf\\xbdFuzul (excess)\\nin Arabic is equivalent to telling a man in English not to be\\nimpertinent\\xef\\xbf\\xbdrolled over on the other side heavily, as doth Encelades, and\\npretended to snore, whilst the cowed Egyptian urged the others to make\\nus move. The question was thus settled by the boy Mohammed who had been\\naroused by the dispute: \\xef\\xbf\\xbdDo you know,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd he whispered, in awful accents, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdwhat\\nthat person is?\\xef\\xbf\\xbd and he pointed to me. \\xef\\xbf\\xbdWhy, no,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd replied the others. \\xef\\xbf\\xbdWell,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\nsaid the youth, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdthe other day the Utaybah showed us death in the Zaribah\\nPass, and what do you think he did?\\xef\\xbf\\xbd \\xef\\xbf\\xbdWallah! what do we know!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd exclaimed the\\nEgyptian, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdWhat did he do?\\xef\\xbf\\xbd \\xef\\xbf\\xbdHe called for\\xef\\xbf\\xbdhis dinner,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd replied the youth, with a\\nslow and\\n</p><p>[p.264] sarcastic emphasis. That trait was enough. The others mounted,\\nand left us quietly to sleep.\\n</p><p>I have been diffuse in relating this little adventure, which is\\ncharacteristic, showing what bravado can do in Arabia. It also suggests\\na lesson, which every traveller in these regions should take well to\\nheart. The people are always ready to terrify him with frightful\\nstories, which are the merest phantoms of cowardice. The reason why the\\nEgyptian displayed so much philanthropy was that, had one of the party\\nbeen lost, the survivors might have fallen into trouble. But in this\\nplace, we were, I believe,\\xef\\xbf\\xbddespite the declarations of our companions\\nthat it was infested with Turpins and Fra Diavolos,\\xef\\xbf\\xbdas safe as in Meccah.\\nEvery night, during the pilgrimage season, a troop of about fifty\\nhorsemen patrol the roads; we were all armed to the teeth, and our\\nparty looked too formidable to be \\xef\\xbf\\xbdcruelly beaten by a single footpad.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd Our\\nnap concluded, we remounted, and resumed the weary way down a sandy\\nvalley, in which the poor donkeys sank fetlock-deep. At dawn we found\\nour companions halted, and praying at the Kahwat Turki, another little\\ncoffee-house. Here an exchange of what is popularly called \\xef\\xbf\\xbdchaff\\xef\\xbf\\xbd took\\nplace. \\xef\\xbf\\xbdWell,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd cried the Egyptian, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdwhat have ye gained by halting? We have\\nbeen quiet here, praying and smoking for the last hour!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd \\xef\\xbf\\xbdGo, eat thy\\nburied beans,[FN#5]\\xef\\xbf\\xbd we replied. \\xef\\xbf\\xbdWhat does an Egyptian boor know of\\nmanliness!\\xef\\xbf\\xbd The surly donkey-boy was worked up into a paroxysm of passion\\nby such small jokes as telling him to convey our salams to the Governor\\nof Jeddah, and by calling the asses after the name of his tribe. He\\nreplied by \\xef\\xbf\\xbdfoul, unmannered, scurril taunts,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd which only drew forth fresh\\nderision, and the coffee-house keeper laughed consumedly,\\n</p><p>[p.265] having probably seldom entertained such \\xef\\xbf\\xbdfunny gentlemen.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n</p><p>Shortly after leaving the Kahwat Turki we found the last spur of the\\nhighlands that sink into the Jeddah Plain. This view would for some\\ntime be my last of\\n</p><p>\\xef\\xbf\\xbdInfamous hills, and sandy, perilous wilds;\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n</p><p>and I contemplated it with the pleasure of one escaping from it. Before\\nus lay the usual iron flat of these regions, whitish with salt, and\\ntawny with stones and gravel; but relieved and beautified by the\\ndistant white walls, whose canopy was the lovely blue sea. Not a tree,\\nnot a patch of verdure was in sight&#160;; nothing distracted our attention\\nfrom the sheet of turquoises in the distance. Merrily the little\\ndonkeys hobbled on, in spite of their fatigue. Soon we distinguished\\nthe features of the town, the minarets, the fortifications\\xef\\xbf\\xbdso celebrated\\nsince their honeycombed guns beat off in 1817 the thousands of Abdullah\\nbin Sa\\xef\\xbf\\xbdud, the Wahhabi,[FN#6] and a small dome outside the walls.\\n</p><p>The sun began to glow fiercely, and we were not sorry when, at about\\neight A.M., after passing through the mass of hovels and coffee-houses,\\ncemeteries and sand-hills, which forms the eastern approach to Jeddah,\\nwe entered the fortified Bab Makkah. Allowing eleven hours for our\\nactual march,\\xef\\xbf\\xbdwe halted about three,\\xef\\xbf\\xbdthose wonderful donkeys had\\naccomplished between forty-four\\n</p><p>[p.266] and forty-six miles,[FN#7] generally in deep sand, in one\\nnight. And they passed the archway of Jeddah cantering almost as nimbly\\nas when they left Meccah.\\n</p><p>Shaykh Nur had been ordered to take rooms for me in a vast pile of\\nmadrepore\\xef\\xbf\\xbdunfossilized coral, a recent formation,\\xef\\xbf\\xbdonce the palace of\\nMohammed bin Aun, and now converted into a Wakalah. Instead of so\\ndoing, Indian-like, he had made a gipsy encampment in the square\\nopening upon the harbour. After administering the requisite correction,\\nI found a room that would suit me. In less than an hour it was swept,\\nsprinkled with water, spread with mats, and made as comfortable as its\\ncapability admitted. At Jeddah I felt once more at home. The sight of\\nthe sea acted as a tonic. The Maharattas were not far wrong when they\\nkept their English captives out of reach of the ocean, declaring that\\nwe were an amphibious race, to whom the wave is a home.\\n</p><p>After a day\\xef\\xbf\\xbds repose at the Caravanserai, the camel-man and donkey-boy\\nclamouring for money, and I not having more than tenpence of borrowed\\ncoin, it was necessary to cash at the British Vice-Consulate a draft\\ngiven to me by the Royal Geographical Society. With some trouble I saw\\nMr. Cole, who, suffering from fever, was declared to be \\xef\\xbf\\xbdnot at home.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd His\\ndragoman did by no means admire my looks; in fact, the general voice of\\nthe household was against me. After some fruitless messages, I sent up\\na scrawl to Mr. Cole, who decided upon admitting the importunate\\nAfghan. An exclamation of astonishment and a hospitable welcome\\nfollowed my self-introduction as an officer of the Indian army. Amongst\\nother things, the Vice-Consul informed me that, in divers discussions\\nwith the Turks about the possibility of an Englishman finding his way\\nen cachette to Meccah,\\n</p><p>[p.267] he had asserted that his compatriots could do everything, even\\npilgrim to the Holy City. The Moslems politely assented to the first,\\nbut denied the second part of the proposition. Mr. Cole promised\\nhimself a laugh at the Turks\\xef\\xbf\\xbd beards; but since my departure, he wrote to\\nme that the subject made the owners look so serious, that he did not\\nlike recurring to it.\\n</p><p>Truly gratifying to the pride of an Englishman was our high official\\nposition assumed and maintained at Jeddah. Mr. Cole had never, like his\\ncolleague at Cairo, lowered himself in the estimation of the proud race\\nwith which he has to deal, by private or mercantile transactions with\\nthe authorities. He has steadily withstood the wrath of the Meccan\\nSharif, and taught him to respect the British name. The Abbe Hamilton\\nascribed the attentions of the Prince to \\xef\\xbf\\xbdthe infinite respect which the\\nArabs entertain for Mr. Cole\\xef\\xbf\\xbds straightforward way of doing business,\\xef\\xbf\\xbdit\\nwas a delicate flattery addressed to him.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd And the writer was right;\\nhonesty of purpose is never thrown away amongst these people. The\\ngeneral contrast between our Consular proceedings at Cairo and Jeddah\\nis another proof of the advisability of selecting Indian officials to\\nfill offices of trust at Oriental courts. They have lived amongst\\nEasterns, and they know one Asiatic language, with many Asiatic\\ncustoms; and, chief merit of all, they have learned to assume a tone of\\ncommand, without which, whatever may be thought of it in England, it is\\nimpossible to take the lead in the East. The \\xef\\xbf\\xbdhome-bred\\xef\\xbf\\xbd diplomate is not\\nonly unconscious of the thousand traps everywhere laid for him, he even\\nplays into the hands of his crafty antagonists by a ceremonious\\npoliteness, which they interpret\\xef\\xbf\\xbdtaking ample care that the\\ninterpretation should spread\\xef\\xbf\\xbdto be the effect of fear or of fraud.\\n</p><p>Jeddah[FN#8] has been often described by modern pens.\\n</p><p>[p.268] Burckhardt (in A.D. 18[14]) devoted a hundred pages of his two\\nvolumes to the unhappy capital of the Tihamat al-Hijaz, the lowlands of\\nthe mountain region. Later still, MM. Mari and Chedufau wrote upon the\\nsubject; and two other French travellers, MM. Galinier and Ferret,\\npublished tables of the commerce in its present state, quoting as\\nauthority the celebrated Arabicist M. Fresnel.[FN#9] These\\n</p><p>[p.269] have been translated by the author of \\xef\\xbf\\xbdLife in Abyssinia.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd Abd\\nal-Karim, writing in 1742, informs us that the French had a factory at\\nJeddah; and in 1760, when Bruce revisited the port, he found the East\\nIndia Company in possession of a post whence they dispersed their\\nmerchandise over the adjoining regions. But though the English were at\\nan early epoch of their appearance in the East received here with\\nespecial favour, I failed to procure a single ancient document.\\n</p><p>Jeddah, when I visited it, was in a state of commotion, owing to the\\nperpetual passage of pilgrims, and provisions were for the same reason\\nscarce and dear. The two large Wakalahs, of which the place boasts,\\nwere crowded with travellers, and many were reduced to encamping upon\\nthe squares. Another subject of confusion was the state of the\\nsoldiery. The Nizam, or Regulars, had not been paid for seven months,\\nand the Arnauts could scarcely sum up what was owing to them. Easterns\\nare wonderfully amenable to discipline; a European army, under the\\ncircumstances, would probably have helped itself. But the Pasha knew\\nthat there is a limit to a man\\xef\\xbf\\xbds endurance, and he was anxiously casting\\nabout for some contrivance that would replenish the empty pouches of\\nhis troops. The worried dignitary must have sighed for those beaux\\njours when privily firing the town and allowing the soldiers to\\nplunder, was the Oriental style of settling arrears of pay.[FN#10]\\n</p><p>[p.270] Jeddah displays all the license of a seaport and garrison town.\\nFair Corinthians establish themselves even within earshot of the\\nKarakun, or guard-post; a symptom of excessive laxity in the\\nauthorities, for it is the duty of the watch to visit all such\\nirregularities with a bastinado preparatory to confinement. My\\nguardians and attendants at the Wakalah used to fetch Araki in a clear\\nglass bottle, without even the decency of a cloth, and the messenger\\ntwice returned from these errands decidedly drunk. More extraordinary\\nstill, the people seemed to take no notice of the scandal.\\n</p><p>The little \\xef\\xbf\\xbdDwarka\\xef\\xbf\\xbd had been sent by the Bombay Steam Navigation Company to\\nconvey pilgrims from Al-Hijaz to India. I was still hesitating about my\\nnext voyage, not wishing to coast the Red Sea in this season without a\\ncompanion, when one morning Omar Effendi appeared at the door, weary,\\nand dragging after him an ass more weary than himself. We supplied him\\nwith a pipe and a cup of hot tea, and, as he was fearful of pursuit, we\\nshowed him a dark hole full of grass under which he might sleep\\nconcealed.\\n</p><p>The student\\xef\\xbf\\xbds fears were realised; his father appeared early the next\\nmorning, and having ascertained from the porter that the fugitive was\\nin the house, politely called upon me. Whilst he plied all manner of\\nquestions, his black slave furtively stared at everything in and about\\nthe room. But we had found time to cover the runaway with grass, and\\nthe old gentleman departed, after a fruitless search. There was,\\nhowever, a grim smile about his mouth which boded no good.\\n</p><p>That evening, returning home from the Hammam, I found the house in an\\nuproar. The boy Mohammed, who had been miserably mauled, was furious\\nwith rage; and Shaykh Nur was equally unmanageable, by reason of his\\nfear. In my absence the father had returned with a posse comitatus of\\nfriends and relatives. They questioned the\\n</p><p>[p.271] youth, who delivered himself of many circumstantial and\\nemphatic mis-statements. Then they proceeded to open the boxes; upon\\nwhich the boy Mohammed cast himself sprawling, with a vow to die rather\\nthan to endure such a disgrace. This procured for him some scattered\\nslaps, which presently became a storm of blows, when a prying little\\nboy discovered Omar Effendi\\xef\\xbf\\xbds leg in the hiding-place. The student was\\nled away unresisting, but mildly swearing that he would allow no\\nopportunity of escape to pass. I examined the boy Mohammed, and was\\npleased to find that he was not seriously hurt. To pacify his mind, I\\noffered to sally out with him, and to rescue Omar Effendi by main\\nforce. This, which would only have brought us all into a brunt with\\nquarterstaves, and similar servile weapons, was declined, as had been\\nforeseen. But the youth recovered complacency, and a few well-merited\\nencomiums upon his \\xef\\xbf\\xbdpluck\\xef\\xbf\\xbd restored him to high spirits.\\n</p><p><br />\\nThe reader must not fancy such escapade to be a serious thing in\\nArabia. The father did not punish his son; he merely bargained with him\\nto return home for a few days before starting to Egypt. This the young\\nman did, and shortly afterwards I met him unexpectedly in the streets\\nof Cairo.\\n</p><p>Deprived of my companion, I resolved to waste no time in the Red Sea,\\nbut to return to Egypt with the utmost expedition. The boy Mohammed\\nhaving laid in a large store of grain, purchased with my money, having\\nsecured all my disposable articles, and having hinted that, after my\\nreturn to India, a present of twenty dollars would find him at Meccah,\\nasked leave, and departed with a coolness for which I could not\\naccount. Some days afterwards Shaykh Nur explained the cause. I had\\ntaken the youth with me on board the steamer, where a bad suspicion\\ncrossed his mind. \\xef\\xbf\\xbdNow, I understand,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd said the boy Mohammed to his\\nfellow-servant, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdyour master is a Sahib from India; he hath laughed at\\nour beards.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n</p><p>[p.272] He parted as coolly from Shaykh Nur. These worthy youths had\\nbeen drinking together, when Mohammed, having learned at Stambul the\\nfashionable practice of Bad-masti, or \\xef\\xbf\\xbdliquor-vice,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd dug his \\xef\\xbf\\xbdfives\\xef\\xbf\\xbd into Nur\\xef\\xbf\\xbds\\neye. Nur erroneously considering such exercise likely to induce\\nblindness, complained to me; but my sympathy was all with the other\\nside. I asked the Hindi why he had not returned the compliment, and the\\nMeccan once more overwhelmed the Miyan with taunt and jibe.\\n</p><p>It is not easy to pass the time at Jeddah. In the square opposite to us\\nwas an unhappy idiot, who afforded us a melancholy spectacle. He\\ndelighted to wander about in a primitive state of toilette, as all such\\nwretches do; but the people of Jeddah, far too civilised to retain\\nMoslem respect for madness, forced him, despite shrieks and struggles,\\ninto a shirt, and when he tore it off they beat him. At other times the\\nopen space before us was diversified by the arrival and the departure\\nof pilgrims, but it was a mere rechauffe of the feast, and had lost all\\npower to please. Whilst the boy Mohammed remained, he used to pass the\\ntime in wrangling with some Indians, who were living next door to us,\\nmen, women, and children, in a promiscuous way. After his departure I\\nused to spend my days at the Vice-Consulate; the proceeding was not\\nperhaps of the safest, but the temptation of meeting a\\nfellow-countryman, and of chatting \\xef\\xbf\\xbdshop\\xef\\xbf\\xbd about the service was too great\\nto be resisted. I met there the principal merchants of Jeddah; Khwajah\\nSower, a Greek; M. Anton, a Christian from Baghdad, and\\nothers.[FN#11]And I was introduced to Khalid Bey, brother of Abdullah\\nbin Sa\\xef\\xbf\\xbdud, the Wahhabi. This noble Arab once held the\\n</p><p>[p.273] official position of Mukayyid al-Jawabat, or Secretary, at\\nCairo, where he was brought up by Mohammed Ali. He is brave, frank, and\\nunprejudiced, fond of Europeans, and a lover of pleasure. Should it be\\nhis fate to become chief of the tribe, a journey to Riyaz, and a visit\\nto Central Arabia, will offer no difficulties to our travellers.\\n</p><p>I now proceed to the last of my visitations. Outside the town of Jeddah\\nlies no less a personage than Sittna Hawwa, the Mother of mankind. The\\nboy Mohammed and I, mounting asses one evening, issued through the\\nMeccan gate, and turned towards the North-East over a sandy plain.\\nAfter half an hour\\xef\\xbf\\xbds ride, amongst dirty huts and tattered coffee-hovels,\\nwe reached the enceinte, and found the door closed. Presently a man\\ncame running with might from the town; he was followed by two others;\\nand it struck me at the time they applied the key with peculiar\\nempressement, and made inordinately low conges as we entered the\\nenclosure of whitewashed walls.\\n</p><p>\\xef\\xbf\\xbdThe Mother\\xef\\xbf\\xbd is supposed to lie, like a Moslemah, fronting the Ka\\xef\\xbf\\xbdabah, with\\nher feet northwards, her head southwards, and her right cheek propped\\nby her right hand. Whitewashed, and conspicuous to the voyager and\\ntraveller from afar, is a diminutive dome with an opening to the West;\\nit is furnished as such places usually are in Al-Hijaz. Under it and in\\nthe centre is a square stone, planted upright and fancifully carved, to\\nrepresent the omphalic region of the human frame. This, as well as the\\ndome, is called Al-Surrah, or the navel. The cicerone directed me to\\nkiss this manner of hieroglyph, which I did, thinking the while, that,\\nunder the circumstances, the salutation was quite uncalled-for. Having\\nprayed here, and at the head, where a few young trees grow, we walked\\nalong the side of the two parallel dwarf walls which define the\\noutlines of the body: they are about six paces apart, and between them,\\nupon Eve\\xef\\xbf\\xbds\\n</p><p>[p.274] neck, are two tombs, occupied, I was told, by Osman Pasha and\\nhis son, who repaired the Mother\\xef\\xbf\\xbds sepulchre. I could not help remarking\\nto the boy Mohammed, that if our first parent measured a hundred and\\ntwenty paces from head to waist, and eighty from waist to heel, she\\nmust have presented much the appearance of a duck. To this the youth\\nreplied, flippantly, that he thanked his stars the Mother was\\nunderground, otherwise that men would lose their senses with fright.\\n</p><p>Ibn Jubayr (twelfth century) mentions only an old dome, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdbuilt upon the\\nplace where Eve stopped on the way to Meccah.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd Yet Al-Idrisi (A.D. 1154)\\ndeclares Eve\\xef\\xbf\\xbds grave to be at Jeddah. Abd al-Karim (1742) compares it to\\na parterre, with a little dome in the centre, and the extremities\\nending in barriers of palisades; the circumference was a hundred and\\nninety of his steps. In Rooke\\xef\\xbf\\xbds Travels we are told that the tomb is\\ntwenty feet long. Ali Bey, who twice visited Jeddah, makes no allusion\\nto it; we may therefore conclude that it had been destroyed by the\\nWahhabis. Burckhardt, who, I need\\n</p><p>[p.275] scarcely say, has been carefully copied by our popular authors,\\nwas informed that it was a \\xef\\xbf\\xbdrude structure of stone, about four feet in\\nlength, two or three feet in height, and as many in breadth\\xef\\xbf\\xbd; thus\\nresembling the tomb of Noah, seen in the valley of Al-Buka\\xef\\xbf\\xbda in Syria.\\nBruce writes: \\xef\\xbf\\xbdTwo days\\xef\\xbf\\xbd journey from this place (? Meccah or Jeddah) Eve\\xef\\xbf\\xbds\\ngrave, of green sods, about fifty yards in length, is shown to this day\\xef\\xbf\\xbd;\\nbut the great traveller probably never issued from the town-gates. And\\nSir W. Harris, who could not have visited the Holy Place, repeats, in\\n1840, that Eve\\xef\\xbf\\xbds grave of green sod is still shown on the barren shore of\\nthe Red Sea.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd The present structure is clearly modern; anciently, I was\\ntold at Jeddah, the sepulchre consisted of a stone at the head, a\\nsecond at the feet, and the navel-dome.\\n</p><p>The idol of Jeddah, in the days of Arab litholatry, was called Sakhrah\\nTawilah, the Long Stone. May not this stone of Eve be the Moslemized\\nrevival of the old idolatry? It is to be observed that the Arabs, if\\nthe tombs be admitted as evidence, are inconsistent in their dimensions\\nof the patriarchal stature. The sepulchre of Adam at the Masjid\\nal-Khayf is, like that of Eve, gigantic. That of Noah at Al-Buka\\xef\\xbf\\xbda is a\\nbit of Aqueduct thirty-eight paces long by one and a half wide. Job\\xef\\xbf\\xbds\\ntomb near Hulah (seven parasangs from Kerbela) is small. I have not\\nseen the grave of Moses (south-east of the Red Sea), which is becoming\\nknown by the bitumen cups there sold to pilgrims. But Aaron\\xef\\xbf\\xbds sepulchre\\nin the Sinaitic peninsula is of moderate dimensions.\\n</p><p>On leaving the graveyard I offered the guardian a dollar, which he\\nreceived with a remonstrance that a man of my dignity should give so\\npaltry a fee. Nor was he at all contented with the assurance that\\nnothing more could be expected from an Afghan Darwaysh, however pious.\\nNext day the boy Mohammed explained the\\n</p><p>[p.276] Man\\xef\\xbf\\xbds empressement and disappointment,\\xef\\xbf\\xbdI had been mistaken for the\\nPasha of Al-Madinah.\\n</p><p>For a time my peregrinations ended. Worn out with fatigue, and the\\nfatal fiery heat, I embarked (Sept. 26) on board the \\xef\\xbf\\xbdDwarka\\xef\\xbf\\xbd; experienced\\nthe greatest kindness from the commander and chief officer (Messrs.\\nWolley and Taylor); and, wondering the while how the Turkish pilgrims\\nwho crowded the vessel did not take the trouble to throw me overboard,\\nin due time I arrived at Suez.\\n</p><p>And here, reader, we part. Bear with me while I conclude, in the words\\nof a brother traveller, long gone, but not forgotten\\xef\\xbf\\xbdFa-hian\\xef\\xbf\\xbdthis Personal\\nNarrative of my Journey to Al-Hijaz: \\xef\\xbf\\xbdI have been exposed to perils, and\\nI have escaped from them; I have traversed the sea, and have not\\nsuccumbed under the severest fatigues; and my heart is moved with\\nemotions of gratitude, that I have been permitted to effect the objects\\nI had in view.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd[FN#12]\\n</p><p>[FN#1] This second plan was defeated by bad health, which detained me\\nin Egypt till a return to India became imperative.\\n[FN#2] The usual hire is thirty piastres, but in the pilgrimage season\\na dollar is often paid. The hire of an ass varies from one to three\\nriyals.\\n[FN#3] Besides the remains of those in ruins, there are on this road\\neight coffee-houses and stations for travellers, private buildings,\\nbelonging to men who supply water and other necessaries.\\n[FN#4] In Ibn Jubayr\\xef\\xbf\\xbds time the Ihram was assumed at Al-Furayn, now a\\ndecayed station, about two hours\\xef\\xbf\\xbd journey from Al-Haddah, towards Jeddah.\\n[FN#5] The favourite Egyptian \\xef\\xbf\\xbdkitchen\\xef\\xbf\\xbd; held to be contemptible food by\\nthe Arabs.\\n[FN#6] In 1817 Abdullah bin Sa\\xef\\xbf\\xbdud attacked Jeddah with 50,000 men,\\ndetermining to overthrow its \\xef\\xbf\\xbdKafir-works\\xef\\xbf\\xbd; namely, its walls and towers.\\nThe assault is described as ludicrous. All the inhabitants aided to\\ngarrison: they waited till the wild men flocked about the place,\\ncrying, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdCome, and let us look at the labours of the infidel,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd they then\\nlet fly, and raked them with matchlock balls and old nails acting\\ngrape. The Wahhabi host at last departed, unable to take a place which\\na single battery of our smallest siege-guns would breach in an hour.\\nAnd since that day the Meccans have never ceased to boast of their\\nGibraltar, and to taunt the Madinites with their wall-less port, Yambu\\xef\\xbf\\xbd.\\n[FN#7] Al-Idrisi places Meccah forty (Arab) miles from Jeddah.\\nBurckhardt gives fifty-five miles, and Ali Bey has not computed the\\ntotal distance.\\n[FN#8] Abulfeda writes the word \\xef\\xbf\\xbdJuddah,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd and Mr. Lane, as well as MM. Mari\\nand Chedufau, adopt this form, which signifies a \\xef\\xbf\\xbdplain wanting water.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd The\\nwater of Jeddah is still very scarce and bad; all who can afford it\\ndrink the produce of hill springs brought in skins by the Badawin. Ibn\\nJubayr mentions that outside the town were 360 old wells(?), dug, it is\\nsupposed by the Persians. \\xef\\xbf\\xbdJeddah,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd or \\xef\\xbf\\xbdJiddah,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd is the vulgar pronounciation;\\nand not a few of the learned call it \\xef\\xbf\\xbdJaddah\\xef\\xbf\\xbd (the grandmother), in\\nallusion to the legend of Eve\\xef\\xbf\\xbds tomb.\\n[FN#9] In Chapters iii. and vi. of this work I have ventured some\\nremarks upon the advisability of our being represented in Al-Hijaz by a\\nConsul, and at Meccah by a native agent, till the day shall come when\\nthe tide of events forces us to occupy the mother-city of Al-Islam. My\\napology for reverting to these points must be the nature of an\\nEnglishman, who would everywhere see his nation \\xef\\xbf\\xbdsecond to none,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd even at\\nJeddah. Yet, when we consider that from twenty-five to thirty vessels\\nhere arrive annually from India, and that the value of the trade is\\nabout twenty-five lacs of rupees, the matter may be thought worth\\nattending to. The following extracts from a letter written to me by Mr.\\nCole shall conclude this part of my task:\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbdYou must know, that in 1838 a commercial treaty was concluded between\\nGreat Britain and the Porte, specifying (amongst many other clauses\\nhere omitted),\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbd1. That all merchandise imported from English ports to Al-Hijaz should\\npay 4 per cent. duty.\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbd2. That all merchandise imported by British subjects from countries not\\nunder the dominion of the Porte should likewise pay but 5 per cent.\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbd3. That all goods exported from countries under the dominion of the\\nPorte should pay 12 per cent., after a deduction of 16 per cent. from\\nthe market-value of the articles.\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbd4. That all monopolies be abolished.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbdNow, when I arrived at Jeddah, the state of affairs was this. A monopoly\\nhad been established upon salt, and this weighed only upon our\\nAnglo-Indian subjects, they being the sole purchasers. Five per cent.\\nwas levied upon full value of goods, no deduction of the 20 per cent.\\nbeing allowed; the same was the case with exports; and most vexatious\\nof all, various charges had been established by the local authorities,\\nunder the names of boat-hire, weighing, brokerage, &amp;c., &amp;c. The duties\\nhad thus been raised from 4 to at least 8 per cent.   *   *   *   This\\nbeing represented at Constantinople, brought a peremptory Firman,\\nordering the governor to act up to the treaty letter by letter. *   *\\n</p>\\n<ul><li>I have had the satisfaction to rectify the abuses of sixteen years\\xef\\xbf\\xbd</li></ul>\\n<p>standing during my first few months of office, but I expect all manner\\nof difficulties in claiming reimbursement for the over-exactions.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n[FN#10] M. Rochet (soi-disant d\\xef\\xbf\\xbdHericourt) amusingly describes this\\nman\\xef\\xbf\\xbduvre of the governor of Al-Hodaydah.\\n[FN#11] Many of them were afterwards victims to the \\xef\\xbf\\xbdJeddah massacre\\xef\\xbf\\xbd on\\nJune 30, 1858. I must refer the reader to my \\xef\\xbf\\xbdLake Regions of Central\\nAfrica\\xef\\xbf\\xbd (Appendix, vol. ii.) for an account of this event, for the\\nproposals which I made to ward it off, and for the miserable folly of\\nthe \\xef\\xbf\\xbdBombay Government,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd who rewarded me by an official reprimand.\\n[FN#12] The curious reader will find details concerning Patriarchal and\\nProphetical Tombs in \\xef\\xbf\\xbdUnexplored Syria,\\xef\\xbf\\xbd i. 33\\xef\\xbf\\xbd35.\\n</p><p>END OF VOLUME III.\\n</p>\\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\"
