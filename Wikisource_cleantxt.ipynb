      "in degree, as does Chateau Margeau from a bottle of cheap strong\n",
      "Spanish wine. To bring out its flavour, the connoisseur smokes it in\n",
      "long pipes of cherry, jasmine, maple, or rosewood, and these require a\n",
      "servant skilled in the arts of cleaning and filling them. The best\n",

      "latter without improving the former. The strongest kind, called Korani\n",
      "or Jabayl, is generally used for cigarettes; it costs, when of\n",

      "privy affairs will become known to every member of the department,\n",
      "except the head, and eventually to that best of spy-trainers, the\n",

      "broken potsherds, and wetted by the sudden discharge. A fear that\n",

      "silence, received a deputation of individuals in whity-brown Burnus,\n",
      "spotted and striped with what Mephistopheles calls a \"curious juice.\"\n",
      "They solicited peace, which we granted upon the condition that they\n",

      "Kuskusu[FN#15] in exchange for fish. As evening fell, we determined,\n",
      "before sleeping, to work upon their \"morale\" as effectually as we had\n",
      "attacked their physique. Shaykh Hamid stood up and indulged them with\n",
      "the Azan, or call to prayers, pronounced after the fashion of\n",
      "Al-Madinah.[FN#16] They performed their devotions in lines ranged\n",
      "behind us as a token of respect, and when worship was over we were\n",
      "questioned about the Holy City till we grew tired of answering. Again\n",
      "our heads and shoulders, our hands and knees,[FN#17] were kissed, but\n",
      "this time in devotion, not in penitence. My companions could scarcely\n",
      "understand half the rugged words which the Maghrabis used,[FN#18] as\n",
      "their dialect was fresh from the\n",
      "</p>\n",
      "<p>[p.199] distant Desert. Still we succeeded in making ourselves\n",
      "intelligible to them, vaunting our dignity as the Sons of the Prophet,\n",
      "and the sanctity of our land which should protect its children from\n",
      "every description of fraud and violence. We benignantly promised to be\n",
      "their guides at Al-Madinah, and the boy Mohammed would conduct their\n",
      "devotions at Meccah, always provided that they repented their past\n",
      "misdeeds, avoided any repetition of the same, and promised to perform\n",
      "the duties of good and faithful pilgrims. Presently the Rais joined our\n",
      "party, and the usual story-telling began. The old man knew the name of\n",
      "each hill, and had a legend for every nook and corner in sight. He\n",
      "dwelt at length upon the life of Abu Zulaymah, the patron saint of\n",
      "these seas, whose little tomb stands at no great distance from our\n",
      "bivouac place, and told us how he sits watching over the safety of\n",
      "pious mariners in a cave among the neighbouring rocks, and sipping his\n",
      "coffee, which is brought in a raw state from Meccah by green birds, and\n",
      "prepared in the usual way by the hands of ministering angels. He showed\n",
      "us the spot where the terrible king of Egypt, when close upon the heels\n",
      "of the children of Israel, was whelmed in the \"hell of waters,[FN#19]\"\n",
      "and he warned us that next day our way would be through breakers, and\n",
      "reefs, and dangerous currents, over whose troubled depths, since that\n",
      "awful day, the Ifrit of the storm has never ceased to flap his sable\n",
      "wing. The wincing of the hearers proved that the shaft of the old man's\n",
      "words was sharp; but as night was advancing, we unrolled our rugs, and\n",
      "fell asleep upon the sand, all of us happy, for we had fed and drunk,\n",
      "and\n",
      "</p>\n",
      "<p>[p.200]-the homo sapiens is a hopeful animal-we made sure that on the\n",
      "morrow the Ifrit would be merciful, and allow us to eat fresh dates at\n",
      "the harbour of Tur.\n",
      "</p>\n",
      "<p>Fair visions of dates doomed to the Limbo of things which should have\n",
      "been! The grey dawn (8th July) looked down upon us in difficulties. The\n",
      "water is deep near this coast; we had anchored at high tide close to\n",
      "the shore, and the ebb had left us high and dry. When this fact became\n",
      "apparent, a storm was upon the point of breaking. The Maghrabis, but\n",
      "for our interference, would have bastinadoed the Rais, who, they said\n",
      "with some reason, ought to have known better. When this phase of\n",
      "feeling passed away, they applied themselves to physical efforts. All\n",
      "except the women and children, who stood on the shore encouraging their\n",
      "relatives with shrill quaverings, threw themselves into the water; some\n",
      "pushed, others applied their shoulders to the vessel's side, and all\n",
      "used their lungs with might and main. But the \"Golden Wire\" was firmly\n",
      "fixed, and their exertions were too irregular. Muscular force failed,\n",
      "upon which they changed their tactics. At the suggestion of their\n",
      "\"Maula,\" they prepared to burn incense in honour of the Shaykh Abu\n",
      "Zulaymah. The material not being forthcoming, they used coffee, which\n",
      "perhaps accounts for the shortcomings of that holy man. After this the\n",
      "Rais remembered that their previous exertions had not begun under the\n",
      "auspices of the Fatihah. Therefore they prayed, and then reapplied\n",
      "themselves to work. Still they failed. Finally, each man called aloud\n",
      "upon his own particular saint or spiritual guide, and rushed forward as\n",
      "if he alone sufficed for the exploit. Shaykh Hamid unwisely quoted the\n",
      "name, and begged the assistance, of his great ancestor, the\n",
      "\"Clarified-Butter-Seller\"; the obdurate \"Golden Wire\" was not moved,\n",
      "and Hamid retired in momentary confusion.\n",

      "<p>It was now about nine A.M., and the water had risen\n",
      "</p>\n",
      "<p>[p.201] considerably. My morning had been passed in watching the influx\n",
      "of the tide, and the grotesque efforts of the Maghrabis. When the\n",
      "vessel showed some symptoms of unsteadiness, I arose, walked gravely up\n",
      "to her, ranged the pilgrims around her with their shoulders to the\n",
      "sides, and told them to heave with might when they heard me invoke the\n",
      "revered name of my patron saint. I raised my hands and voice; \"Ya Piran\n",
      "Pir! Ya Abd al-Kadir Jilani[FM#20]\" was the signal. Each Maghrabi\n",
      "worked like an Atlas, the \"Golden Wire\" canted half over, and, sliding\n",
      "heavily through the sand, once more floated off into deep water. This\n",
      "was generally voted a minor miracle, and the Effendi was respected-for\n",
      "a day or two.\n",
      "</p>\n",
      "<p>The wind was fair, but we had all to re-embark, an operation which went\n",
      "on till noon. After starting I remarked the natural cause which gives\n",
      "this Birkat Faraun-\"Pharaoh's Bay,\"-a bad name. Here the gulf narrows;\n",
      "and the winds, which rush down the clefts and valleys of the lofty\n",
      "mountains on the Eastern and Western shores, meeting tides and\n",
      "counter-currents, cause a perpetual commotion. That day the foam-tipped\n",
      "waves repeatedly washed over my cot, by no means diminishing its\n",
      "discomforts. In the evening, or rather late in the afternoon, we\n",
      "anchored, to our infinite disgust, under a ridge of rocks, behind which\n",
      "lies the plain of Tur. The Rais deterred all from going on shore by\n",
      "terrible stories about the Badawin that haunt the place, besides which\n",
      "there was no sand to sleep upon. We remained, therefore, on board that\n",
      "night; and, making sail early the next morning, we threaded through\n",
      "reefs and sand-banks about noon into the intricate and dangerous\n",
      "entrance of Tur.\n",

      "<p>Nothing can be meaner than the present appearance of the old Phoenician\n",

      "<p>[p.202] harbour, and its plentiful supply of fruit and fresh water,\n",
      "make it one of the most frequented places on the coast. The only\n",
      "remains of any antiquity-except the wells-are the fortifications which\n",
      "the Portuguese erected to keep out the Badawin. The little town lies\n",
      "upon a plain that stretches with a gradual rise from the sea to the\n",
      "lofty mountain-axis of the Sinaitic group.\tThe country around\n",
      "reminded me strongly of maritime Sind; a flat of clay and sand, clothed\n",
      "with sparse turfs of Salsolae, and bearing strong signs of a\n",
      "(geologically speaking) recent origin. The town is inhabited\n",
      "principally by Greek and other Christians,[FN#21] who live by selling\n",
      "water and provisions to ships. A fleecy cloud hung lightly over the\n",
      "majestic head of Jabal Tur, about eventide, and the outlines of the\n",
      "giant hills stood \"picked out\" from the clear blue sky. Our Rais,\n",
      "weather-wise man, warned us that these were indications of a gale, and\n",
      "that, in case of rough weather, he did not intend to leave Tur. I was\n",
      "not sorry to hear this. We had passed a pleasant day, drinking sweet\n",
      "water, and eating the dates, grapes, and pomegranates, which the people\n",
      "of the place carry down to the beach for the benefit of hungry\n",
      "pilgrims. Besides which, there were various sights to see, and with\n",
      "these we might profitably spend the morrow. We therefore pitched the\n",

      "lighter by the absence of the Maghrabis, some of whom were wandering\n",
      "about the beach, whilst others had gone off to fill their bags with\n",
      "fresh water. We found their surliness insufferable; even when we were\n",
      "passing from poop to forecastle, landing or boarding, they grumbled\n",
      "forth their dissatisfaction.\n",
      "</p>\n",
      "<p>Our Rais was not mistaken in his prediction. The fleecy cloud on Tur's\n",
      "tops had given true warning. When morning (9th July) broke, we found\n",
      "the wind strong, and the sea white with foam. Most of us thought\n",
      "lightly of these terrors, but our valorous captain swore that he dared\n",
      "not for his life cross in such a storm the mouth of ill-omened Akabah.\n",
      "We breakfasted, therefore, and afterwards set out to visit Moses' Hot\n",
      "Baths, mounted on wretched donkeys with pack-saddles, ignorant of\n",
      "stirrups, and without tails, whilst we ourselves suffered generally\n",
      "from boils, which, as usual upon a journey, make their appearance in\n",
      "localities the most inconvenient. Our road lay northward across the\n",
      "plain towards a long narrow strip of date ground, surrounded by a\n",
      "ruinous mud wall. After a ride of two or three miles, we entered the\n",
      "gardens, and came suddenly upon the Hammam. It is a prim little Cockney\n",
      "bungalow, built by Abbas Pasha of Egypt for his own accommodation;\n",
      "glaringly whitewashed, and garnished with diwans and calico curtains of\n",
      "a gorgeous hue. The guardian had been warned of our visit, and was\n",
      "present to supply us with bathing-cloths and other necessaries. One by\n",
      "one we entered the cistern, which is now in an inner room. The water is\n",
      "about four feet deep, warm in winter, cool in summer, of a\n",
      "saltish-bitter taste, but celebrated for its invigorating qualities,\n",
      "when applied externally. On one side of the calcareous rock, near the\n",
      "ground, is the hole opened for the spring by Moses' rod, which must\n",
      "have been like the \"mast of some tall\n",

      "finger-marks existed, and that they were long enough for a man to lie\n",
      "in. The same functionary attributed the sanitary properties of the\n",
      "spring to the blessings of the Prophet, and, when asked why Moses had\n",
      "not made sweet water to flow, informed us that the Great Lawgiver had\n",
      "intended the spring for bathing in, not for drinking. We sat with him,\n",
      "eating the small yellow dates of Tur, which are delicious, melting like\n",
      "honey in the mouth, and leaving a surpassing arriere gout. After\n",
      "finishing sundry pipes and cups of coffee, we gave the bath-man a few\n",
      "piastres, and, mounting our donkeys, started eastward for the Bir\n",

      "built round and domed over with roughly squared stones, very like what\n",
      "may be seen in some rustic parts of Southern England. The sides of the\n",
      "pit were so rugged that a man could climb down them, and at the bottom\n",
      "was a pool of water, sweet and abundant. We had intended to stay there,\n",
      "and to dine al fresco, but the hated faces of our companions, the\n",
      "Maghrabis, meeting us at the entrance, nipped that project in the bud.\n",

      "when invited so to do. They were poorly dressed, and all armed with\n",
      "knives and cheap sabres, hanging to leathern bandoleers: in language\n",
      "and demeanour they showed few remains of their old ferocity. As late as\n",

      "that the captain of one of them would land us at Yambu' for three\n",

      "blessing the Prophet is one of peculiar efficacy in a religious point\n",

      "by a glorious figure, the personification of the blessings which had\n",
      "been called down by them upon Mohammed's head. This most poetical idea\n",
      "is borrowed, I believe, from the ancient Guebres, who fabled that a\n",

      "his soul when winding its way to judgment. Also when a Moslem blesses\n",
      "Mohammed at Al-Madinah, his sins are not written down for three\n",
      "days,-thus allowing ample margin for repentance,-by the recording\n",
      "angel. Al-Malakayn (the two Angels), or Kiram al-Katibin (the Generous\n",

      "principle of man's nature; they are fabled to occupy each a shoulder,\n",
      "and to keep a list of words and deeds. This is certainly borrowed from\n",
      "a more ancient faith. In Hermas II. (command. 6), we are told that\n",
      "\"every man has two angels, one of godliness, the other of iniquity,\"\n",
      "who endeavour to secure his allegiance,-a superstition seemingly\n",
      "founded upon the dualism of the old Persians. Mediaeval Europe, which\n",
      "borrowed so much from the East at the time of the Crusades, degraded\n",
      "these angels into good and bad fairies for children's stories.\n",
      "[FN#29] Burckhardt writes this word Hedjra (which means \"flight\"). Nor\n",
      "is M. Caussin de Perceval's \"El Hadjarat\" less erroneous. At Madinah it\n",
      "is invariably called Al-Hujrah-the chamber. The chief difficulty in\n",
      "distinguishing the two words, meaning \"chamber\" and \"flight,\" arises\n",
      "from our only having one h to represent the hard and soft h of Arabic,\n",
      "???? [Arabic text] and ???? [Arabic text]. In the case of common\n",
      "saints, the screen or railing round the cenotaph is called a \"Maksurah.\"\n",
      "[FN#30] Yet Mohammed enjoined his followers to frequent graveyards.\n",
      "\"Visit graves; of a verity they shall make you think of futurity!\" And\n",

      "been in the world, before that, a disobedient.\"\n",
      "[FN#31] The truth is no one knows what is there. I have even heard a\n",
      "learned Persian declare that there is no wall behind the curtain, which\n",
      "hangs so loosely that, when the wind blows against it, it defines the\n",
      "form of a block of marble, or a built-up tomb. I believe this to be\n",
      "wholly apocryphal, for reasons which will presently be offered.\n",
      "[FN#32] The peculiar place where the guardians of the tomb sit and\n",
      "confabulate is the Dakkat al-Aghawat (eunuch's bench) or Al-Mayda-the\n",
      "table-a raised bench of stone and wood, on the North side of the\n",
      "Hujrah. The remaining part of this side is partitioned off from the\n",
      "body of the Mosque by a dwarf wall, inclosing the \"Khasafat al-Sultan,\"\n",

      "of the Koran, on behalf of the reigning Sultan.\n",
      "[FN#33] The ancient practice of Al-Islam during the recitation of the\n",
      "following benedictions was to face Meccah, the back being turned\n",
      "towards the tomb, and to form a mental image of the Prophet, supposing\n",
      "him to be in front. Al-Kirmani and other doctors prefer this as the\n",
      "more venerable custom, but in these days it is completely exploded, and\n",
      "the purist would probably be soundly bastinadoed by the eunuchs for\n",
      "attempting it.\n",
      "[FN#34] This is the usual introduction to a quotation from the Koran.\n",
      "[FN#35] It may easily be conceived how offensive this must be to the\n",
      "Wahhabis, who consider it blasphemy to assert that a mere man can stand\n",
      "between the Creator and the creature on the last day.\n",
      "[FN#36] This is called the Testification. Like the Fatihah, it is\n",
      "repeated at every holy place and tomb visited at Al-Madinah.\n",
      "[FN#37] Burckhardt mentions that in his day, among other favours\n",
      "supplicated in prayer to the Deity, the following request was\n",
      "made,-\"Destroy our enemies, and may the torments of hell-fire be their\n",
      "lot!\" I never heard it at the Prophet's tomb. As the above benediction\n",
      "is rather a long one, the Zair is allowed to shorten it a discretion,\n",
      "but on no account to say less than \"Peace be upon Thee, O Apostle of\n",
      "Allah\"-this being the gist of the ceremony.\n",
      "[FN#38] Though performing Ziyarat for myself, I had promised my old\n",
      "Shaykh at Cairo to recite a Fatihah in his name at the Prophet's tomb;\n",
      "so a double recitation fell to my lot. If acting Zair for another\n",
      "person (a common custom, we read, even in the days of Al-Walid, the\n",
      "Caliph of Damascus), you are bound to mention your principal's name at\n",
      "the beginning of the benediction, thus: \"Peace be upon Thee, O Apostle\n",
      "of Allah from such an one, the son of such an one, who wants Thine\n",

      "lent a credulous ear to the eminent Arab merchant, who told him that a\n",
      "guard was placed over the tomb to prevent the populace scraping dirt\n",
      "from about it, and preserving it as a relic.\n",
      "[FN#49] Burckhardt writes this author's name El Samhoudy, and in this\n",
      "he is followed by all our popular book-makers. Moslems have three ways\n",
      "of spelling it: 1. Al-Samhudi, 2. Al-Samahnudi, and 3. Al-Samanhudi. I\n",
      "prefer the latter, believing that the learned Shaykh, Nur al-Din Ali\n",

      "[FN#50] Burckhardt, however, must be in error when he says \"The tombs\n",
      "are also covered with precious stuffs, and in the shape of catafalques,\n",
      "like that of Ibrahim in the great Mosque of Meccah.\" The eunuchs\n",
      "positively declare that no one ever approaches the tomb, and that he\n",
      "who ventured to do so would at once be blinded by the supernatural\n",
      "light. Moreover the historians of Al-Madinah all quote tales of certain\n",
      "visions of the Apostle, directing his tomb to be cleared of dust that\n",
      "had fallen upon it from above, in which case some man celebrated for\n",
      "piety and purity was let through a hole in the roof, by cords, down to\n",
      "the tomb, with directions to wipe it with his beard. This style of\n",
      "ingress is explained by another assertion of Al-Samanhudi, quoted by\n",
      "Burckhardt. \"In A.H. 892, when Kaid-Bey rebuilt the Mosque, which had\n",
      "been destroyed by lightning, three deep graves were found in the\n",

      "entered it, saw no traces of tombs. The original place of Mohammed's\n",

      "289) believes that the mass of rock popularly described as hanging\n",
      "unsupported in the Mosque of Omar at Jerusalem was confounded by\n",
      "Christians, who could not have seen either of these Moslem shrines,\n",

      "has much to do with this. In the days of hard drinking our Egyptian\n",
      "army suffered severely, and the Austrian army in Tuscany showed how\n",
      "often blindness is caused by importing Northern habits into Southern\n",
      "countries. Many Europeans in Egypt wash their eyes with cold water,\n",
      "especially after walking, and some use once a day a mildly astringent\n",
      "or cooling wash, as Goulard's lotion or vinegar and water. They avoid\n",
      "letting flies settle upon their eyes, and are of opinion that the\n",

      "remarks. In the first account of the magician by Mr. Lane, we have a\n",
      "fair and dispassionate recital of certain magical, mystical, or\n",
      "mesmeric phenomena, which \"excited considerable curiosity and interest\n",
      "th[r]oughout the civilised world.\" As usual in such matters, the\n",
      "civilised world was wholly ignorant of what was going on at home;\n",
      "otherwise, in London, Paris, and New York, they might have found dozens\n",
      "studying the science. But a few years before, Dr. Herklots had\n",
      "described the same practice in India, filling three goodly pages; but\n",
      "he called his work \"Qanoon-i-Islam,\" and, consequently, despite its\n",
      "excellencies, it fell still-born from the press. Lady H. Stanhope\n",
      "frequently declared \"the spell by which the face of an absent person is\n",
      "thrown upon a mirror to be within the reach of the humblest and most\n",
      "contemptible of magicians;\" but the civilised world did not care to\n",
      "believe a prophetess. All, however, were aroused by Mr. Lane's\n",
      "discovery, and determined to decide the question by the ordeal of\n",
      "reason. Accordingly, in A.D. 1844, Mr. Lane, aided by Lord Nugent and\n",
      "others, discovered that a \"coarse and stupid fraud\" had been\n",
      "perpetrated upon him by Osman Effendi, the Scotchman. In 1845, Sir G.\n",
      "Wilkinson remarked of this rationalism, \"The explanation lately\n",
      "offered, that Osman Effendi was in collusion with the magician, is\n",
      "neither fair on him nor satisfactory, as he was not present when those\n",
      "cases occurred which were made so much of in Europe,\" and he proposed\n",
      "\"leading questions and accidents\" as the word of the riddle. Eothen\n",
      "attributed the whole affair to \"shots,\" as schoolboys call them, and\n",
      "ranked success under the head of Paley's \"tentative miracles.\" A writer\n",
      "in the Quarterly explained them by suggesting the probability of divers\n",
      "(impossible) optical combinations, and, lest the part of belief should\n",
      "have been left unrepresented, Miss Martineau was enabled to see clear\n",
      "signs of mesmeric action, and by the decisive experiment of self,\n",
      "discovered the magic to be an \"affair of mesmerism.\" Melancholy to\n",
      "relate, after all this philosophy, the herd of travellers at Cairo is\n",

      "great power among the Arabs. As a general rule, they are at the bottom\n",
      "of all mischief. It was a Sharif (Hosayn bin Ali) who tore down and\n",

      "fellow-travellers, Messrs. Didier and Hamilton, being far more\n",
      "competent to lay the subject before the public. A few political remarks\n",
      "may not be deemed out of place. The present Sharif, despite his\n",
      "civilised training at Constantinople, is, and must be a fanatic,\n",
      "bigoted man. He applied for the expulsion of the British Vice-Consul at\n",
      "Jeddah, on the grounds that an infidel should not hold position in the\n",
      "Holy Land. His pride and reserve have made him few friends, although\n",
      "the Meccans, with their enthusiastic nationality, extol his bravery to\n",
      "the skies, and praise him for conduct as well as for courage. His\n",
      "position at present is anomalous. Ahmad Pasha of Al-Hijaz rules\n",
      "politically as representative of the Sultan. The Sharif, who, like the\n",
      "Pope, claims temporal as well as spiritual dominion, attempts to\n",
      "command the authorities by force of bigotry. The Pasha heads the\n",
      "Turkish, now the ruling party. The Sharif has in his interest the Arabs\n",
      "and the Badawin. Both thwart each other on all possible occasions;\n",
      "quarrels are bitter and endless; there is no government, and the vessel\n",
      "of the State is in danger of being water-logged, in consequence of the\n",
      "squabbling between her two captains. When I was at Meccah all were in a\n",
      "ferment, the Sharif having, it is said, insisted upon the Pasha leaving\n",
      "Taif. The position of the Turks in Al-Hijaz becomes every day more\n",
      "dangerous. Want of money presses upon them, and reduces them to\n",
      "degrading measures. In February, 1853, the Pasha hired a forced loan\n",
      "from the merchants, and but for Mr. Cole�s spirit and firmness, the\n",
      "English proteges would have been compelled to contribute their share.\n",
      "After a long and animated discussion, the Pasha yielded the point by\n",
      "imprisoning his recusant subjects, who insisted upon Indians paying,\n",
      "like themselves. He waited in person with an apology upon Mr. Cole.\n",
      "Though established at Jeddah since 1838, the French and English\n",
      "Consuls, contented with a proxy, never required a return of visit from\n",
      "the Governor. If the Turks be frequently reduced to such expedients for\n",
      "the payment of their troops, they will soon be swept from the land. On\n",
      "the other hand, the Sharif approaches a crisis. His salary, paid by the\n",
      "Sultan, may be roughly estimated at �15,000 per annum. If the Turks\n",
      "maintain their footing in Arabia, it will probably be found that an\n",
      "honourable retreat at Stambul is better for the thirty-first descendant\n",
      "of the Prophet than the turbulent life of Meccah; or that a reduced\n",
      "allowance of �500 per annum would place him in a higher spiritual, though\n",
      "in a lower temporal position. Since the above was written the Sharif\n",
      "Abd al-Muttalib has been deposed. The Arabs of Al-Hijaz united in\n",
      "revolt against the Sultan, but after a few skirmishes they were reduced\n",
      "to subjection by their old ruler the Sharif bin Aun.\n",
      "[FN#31] Saniyat means a �winding path,� and Kuda�a, �the cut.� Formerly Meccah\n",
      "had three gates: 1. Bab al-Ma�ala, North-East; 2. Bab al-Umrah, or Bab\n",
      "al-Zahir, on the Jeddah road, West; and 3[.] Bab al-Masfal on the Yaman\n",
      "road. These were still standing in the twelfth century, but the walls\n",
